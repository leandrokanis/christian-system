# Preface

**Since** the full development of the great apostasy foretold by Prophets and Apostles, numerous attempts at reformation have been made. Three full centuries, carrying with them the destinies of countless millions, have passed into eternity since the Lutheran effort to dethrone the Man of Sin. During this period many significant and wonderful changes have taken place in the political, literary, moral, and religious conditions of society. That the nations composing the western half of the Roman Empire have already been greatly benefited by that effort, scientifically, politically, and morally, no person acquainted with either political or ecclesiastical history can reasonably doubt. Time, that great arbiter of human actions, that great revealer of secrets, has long decided that all the reformers of the Papacy have been public benefactors. And thus the Protestant Reformation is proved to have been one of the most splendid eras in the history of the world, and will long be regarded by philosophers and philanthropists as one of the most gracious interpositions on behalf of the entire human race.

We Americans owe our national privileges and our civil liberties to the Protestant reformers. They achieved not only imperishable fame for themselves but a rich legacy for their descendants. When we compare the current state of these United States with Spanish America, and the condition of the English nation with that of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, we begin to appreciate how much we are indebted to the intelligence, faith, and courage of Martin Luther and his heroic associates in that glorious reformation.

He restored the Bible to the world in A.D. 1534, and boldly defended its claims against the impious and arrogant pretensions of the haughty and tyrannical See of Rome. But, unfortunately, at his death there was no Joshua to lead the people, who rallied under the banners of the Bible, out of the wilderness in which Luther died. His tenets were soon converted into a new state religion, and the spirit of reformation which he sparked and inspired was quickly extinguished by the conflicts and feuds of the Protestant princes and the clashes of rival political interests, both on the continent and in the islands of Europe.

While Protestant hatred toward the Roman Pontiff and the Papacy continued to increase, a secret desire within Protestants for ecclesiastical power and patronage took root, leading the members of the Protestant Popes to gradually assimilate the new church to the old. Creeds and manuals, synods and councils, soon shackled the minds of men, and the spirit of reformation gradually abandoned the Protestant church, or was supplanted by the spirit of the world.

Calvin renewed the speculative theology of Saint Augustine, and Geneva in a few years became the Alexandria of modern Europe. The power of religion was soon submerged in debates about forms and ceremonies, speculative disputes of opinion, and intense arguments regarding the political and religious right to burn heretics. Still, however, in all these conflicts, much light was produced; and had it not been for these extremes, it is questionable whether the wound inflicted upon the _Man of Sin_ would have been as incurable as it has since proven to be.

Reformation, however, became the order of the day; and this was certainly a significant matter, however it may have been managed! It was a revolution, and revolutions seldom move backward. The example that Luther set was of more value than all the achievements of Charles V. or the literary and moral labors of his distinguished contemporary, the learned Erasmus.

It is intriguing to observe how extremes begot extremes at every step of the reformation cause, up until the dawn of the present century. The penances, works of faith, and supererogation of the Roman church drove Luther and Calvin to the extreme position of "faith alone."

After the Protestants debated their own principles among themselves until they lost all brotherly affection, they would just as soon have "communed in the sacrament" with the Catholics as with one another; speculative abstracts of Christian Platonism and the sublime mysteries of Egyptian theology became alternately the bond of union and the source of discord among the fathers and friends of the reformation.

The _five_ great dogmas of the Geneva reformer were taken to Amsterdam and generated in the mind of James Arminius in 1591 five opposing opinions; and these at the synod of Dort, in 1618, formed a new party of Remonstrants.

Into Britain, whose history we are more immediately concerned with, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Arminianism were soon imported; and, like all raw materials introduced there, were immediately re-manufactured. They were all exotics but easily acclimated, soon flourishing in Britain more luxuriantly than in their native soil. However, the meager elements of opinions, forms, and ceremonies they gave rise to caused the _"Spirit alone"_ to germinate in the mind of George Fox, in little more than half a century after the introduction of the Leyden theology.

In Lord Chatham's days, the Episcopal church, as he stated, was a peculiar combination — "A Popish liturgy, Calvinistic articles, and an Arminian clergy." But every few years witnessed a new dissension and reformation, until the kirk of Scotland and the church of England were compelled to respect, to some degree, the rights of conscience, even among dissenters themselves.

Abroad it was no better. The Saxon reformer had his friends; John of Picardy lived in the grateful remembrance of the Geneva family; and James of Amsterdam speculated very liberally among all the Remonstrants at home and abroad. In Sweden, Holland, Germany, England, and Scotland, the debate did not vary essentially: the Pope against the Protestants — the Lutherans against the Calvinists — the Calvinists against the Arminians — the Bishops against the Presbyters — and the Presbyterians among themselves; until, through the potency of metaphysics and politics, they are now reduced to various parties.

While philosophy, mysticism, and politics drove the parties into contradictory extremes; while justification by metaphysical faith alone; while the forms and ceremonies of all sects birthed the "Spirit alone" in the mind of George Fox; while the Calvinian five points generated the Arminian five points; and while the Westminster Creed, though unsubscribed by its makers, spawned a hundred others — not until within the present generation did any sect or party in Christendom unite and build upon the Bible alone.

Since then, the first effort known to us to abandon the whole controversy about creeds and reformations, and to _restore_ primitive Christianity, or to build solely upon the Apostles and Prophets, with Jesus Christ himself as the chief cornerstone, has been made.

Tired of new creeds and new parties in religion, and of the numerous failed efforts to reform the reformation; convinced from the Holy Scriptures, observation, and experience, that the unity of the disciples of Christ is essential to the conversion of the world, and that correcting and improving no creed or partisan establishment in Christendom could ever become the basis for such unity, communion, and cooperation that would restore peace to a church in conflict or triumph to the common salvation; a few individuals, around the beginning of the present century, began to reflect on ways and means to restore primitive Christianity.

This led to a careful, conscientious, and prayerful examination of the grounds and reasons for the current state of affairs in all the Protestant sects. Upon examining the history of all the platforms and constitutions of these sects, it became evident, almost like a mathematical demonstration, that neither the Augsburg articles of faith and opinion, nor the Westminster, nor the Wesleyan, nor those of any state creed or dissenting establishment could ever improve the condition of things, restore unity to the church, peace to the world, or success to the gospel of Christ.

As the Bible was proclaimed and constantly affirmed to be the religion of Protestants, it remained a mysterious problem for some time why the Bible alone, acknowledged and accepted, should yield no happier results than the strife, division, and retaliatory excommunications of rival Protestant sects. However, it appeared in this case, after a closer acquaintance with the details of the inner workings of sectarian Christianity, that it is not merely the acknowledgment of a good rule that brings happiness to society, but walking by it. The Bible in the lips, and the creed of the head and in the heart, will not save the church from strife, rivalry, and schism. There is no moral, ecclesiastical, or political good simply by acknowledging it in word. It must be obeyed.

In our ecclesiastical pilgrimage, we have occasionally encountered some vehement declaimers against human-written creeds and advocates for the Bible alone, who were all the while preaching the opinions of _Saint_ Arius or _Saint_ Athanasius. Their sentiments, language, style, and general views of the gospel were as human as auricular confession, extreme unction, or purgatorial purification.

The Bible alone is the Bible only, in word and deed, in profession and practice; and this alone can reform the world and save the church. Judging others, we once judged ourselves; there are many who advocate the Bible alone while preaching their own opinions. Before we applied the Bible alone to our views, or aligned our views and religious practices with the Bible, we pleaded the old theme — "The Bible alone is the religion of Protestants." But we found it an arduous task, one lasting twenty years, to correct our diction and purify our speech according to the Bible alone; and even now we have not wholly rejected the language of Ashdod. We profess only to work and walk by the rules that will inevitably lead to a pure speech and right conceptions of that pure, holy, and celestial thing called Christianity — in faith, in sentiment, and in practice.

A deep and abiding impression that the power, consolations, and joys — the holiness and happiness — of Christ's religion were lost in the forms and ceremonies, in the speculations and conjectures, and in the feuds and bickerings of sects and schisms, originated a project many years ago for uniting the sects, or rather the _Christians_ in all the sects, upon a clear and scriptural bond of union — having a _"thus saith the Lord,"_ either in express terms or in approved precedent, "for every article of faith and item of religious practice." This was offered in the year 1809, in the "Declaration and Address" of the Washington Association, Pennsylvania. It was first proposed to the parties that confessed the Westminster creed; but equally submitted to Protestants of every name, making faith in Christ and obedience to him the only test of Christian character and the only bond of church unity, communion, and cooperation. It was indeed approved by all; but adopted and practiced by none, except a few, or part of a few, who made the overture.

None of us who either initiated or supported that project were then aware of the havoc that the aforementioned principle, if faithfully applied, would wreak on our views and practices on various cherished points. When we take a close retrospective view of the last thirty years (for we have a fairly distinct recollection of our travels during that period) and of the workings of that principle in heart and life, with which we began our public career in the Lord's work, we struggle to express our astonishment better than in the following parable:

A citizen of the West had a very promising young vineyard on a fruitful hill. He had no practical knowledge in the cultivation of grapes; but had read extensively about the care, pruning, and management of vines. He built a wine vat and prepared all the implements for the vintage. However, he lacked practical skill in using the pruning knife. His vines flourished exceedingly, stretching their tendrils in every direction; but he produced no vintage.

One day a vine dresser from Oporto appeared as he was contemplating his disappointments. He was celebrated in his profession, the most skilled in all aspects of vineyard care. The owner of the vineyard, having employed him to tend his vineyard, set out on a long journey for a few weeks. Upon his return visit to the farm, he walked out to his vineyard one day; to his amazement, the ground was literally covered with prunings from his vines. The vine dresser had skillfully and freely used the pruning hook, leaving hardly more than the roots and bare stems of the vines standing near the frames.

'My vineyard is ruined! My hopes blighted! I am undone! I am ruined!' exclaimed the unhappy husbandman. 'Unfortunate wretch! You have deceived me; you have robbed me of the labor of five years and dashed my bright hopes for years to come!' The vine dresser stood in shock; but as the storm subsided, he ventured to say, — 'Master, I will serve you five years for free if we gather more grapes and have a better vineyard this year than you have gathered in all the years since you planted these vines.' The proprietor of the vintage withdrew, saying, — 'It is impossible! It is impossible!' and did not visit it again until invited by his vine dresser around mid-autumn; when, to his even greater astonishment and delight, he found incomparably more grapes than previously gathered from his vines, and of much better quality.

So, in the matter before us, the application of the principle we stated trimmed us so bare that we strongly began to suspect its fallacy and nearly abandoned it as a deceitful speculation. Time, however, the great teacher, and Experience, that great critic, have assured us that the principle is indeed beneficial, and that although we seemingly lose much by its application, our loss comprises merely barren opinions, fruitless speculations, and useless traditions that only encumber the ground and hinder the word, making it largely unfruitful.

We believe that the principles are now clearly and fully developed through the united efforts of a few devoted and passionate minds, who set out determined to sacrifice everything to truth and pursue her wherever she may lead: I say, the principles on which the church of Jesus Christ — all believers in Jesus as the Messiah — can be united with honor to themselves and with blessings to the world; on which the gospel and its ordinances can be restored in all their primitive simplicity, excellence, and power, allowing the church to shine as a lamp that burns to the conviction and salvation of the world: — I say, the principles by which these things can be accomplished are now developed, alongside the principles themselves, which together make up _the original gospel and order of things_ established by the Apostles.

The purpose of this volume is to present to the community in a clear, definite, and understandable style the capital principles that have been raised, debated, developed, and sustained in a controversy over _twenty-five years_, by the voices and writings of those who rallied under the banners of the Bible alone. The principle inscribed upon our banners when we withdrew from the ranks of the sects was, _'Faith in Jesus as the true Messiah, and obedience to him as our Lawgiver and King, the *only test* of Christian character, and the *only bond* of Christian union, communion, and cooperation, irrespective of all creeds, opinions, commandments, and traditions of men.'_

This cause, like every other, was initially argued by speech; afterwards by writing and the press. The history of its progress mirrors the history of every other religious revolution, in this respect — that different points, at different times, almost exclusively engrossed the attention of its advocates. We began with the *outposts* and vanguard of the opposition. As soon as we secured one position, our efforts were redirected against another; and as the smoke of the enemy cleared, we advanced upon their lines.

The first piece written on the subject of the great position was penned by Thomas Campbell, Senior, in the year 1809. An association was formed that year for the dissemination of the principles of reformation; and the piece mentioned was titled "The Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington, Pennsylvania."

The foundational principle of this "Christian Association" and its objective are clearly expressed in the following resolution: — "That this society, formed for the sole purpose of promoting simple evangelical Christianity, shall, to the best of its ability, support such ministers, and such only, as show a clear conformity to the _Original Standard_ in conversation and doctrine, in zeal and diligence; only such as put into practice the _simple original_ form of Christianity, explicitly exhibited on the sacred page, without attempting to teach anything of human authority, private opinion, or inventions of men, as having any place in the constitution, faith, or worship of the Christian church; or anything as a matter of _Christian faith_ or _duty_, for which there cannot be produced a '_thus saith the Lord,_' either in direct terms or by approved precedent."

The ground covered in this resolution provided ample material for debate. Every inch of it was discussed, argued, and examined for several years, in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio. We set sail on this foundation, with scarcely enough hands to man the ship. We faced headwinds and rough seas for the first seven years. A recounting of which would be both curious and interesting.

But to distinguish this plea and effort from some other almost contemporaneous movements, we should emphasize that while the Remonstrants fought against human creeds, evidently because those creeds opposed their private opinions and preferred dogmas, which they desired to replace, — this enterprise, so far as it was hostile to those creeds, opposed them not because of their hostility to any private or favored opinions that were sought to be replaced; but because those human institutions supplanted the Bible, rendered the word of God ineffective, jeopardized the intelligence, unity, purity, holiness, and happiness of the disciples of Christ, and were antagonistic to the salvation of the world.

Unitarians, for example, have fought against human creeds because those creeds taught Trinitarianism. Arminians, too, have opposed creeds because they upheld Calvinism. It has indeed been claimed that all schismatics, good and bad, since the days of John Wycliffe, and long before, have opposed creeds of human invention because those creeds opposed them. But as far as their controversy resembles ours in its opposition to creeds, it must be distinguished by this essential attribute: — that our _opposition to creeds derived from a conviction that whether the opinions in them were true or false, they were hostile to the unity, peace, harmony, purity, and joy of Christians; and adverse to the conversion of the world to Jesus Christ._

Next to our personal salvation, two objectives constituted the _summum bonum_, the supreme good, worthy of sacrificing all temporalities. The first was the union, peace, purity, and harmonious cooperation of Christians — guided by an understanding illuminated by the Holy Scriptures; the other was the conversion of sinners to God. Our inclinations and aversions on all religious questions arose from, and were controlled by, those all-consuming interests. From these began our campaign against creeds. In the beginning, we did not have, and we still do not have, a favored opinion or speculation that we would offer as a substitute for any human creed or constitution in Christendom.

We were not, indeed, at first aware of the havoc our _principles_ would wreak on our opinions. However, we soon found our principles and opinions in conflict on some points; and the question quickly arose, _Shall we sacrifice our principles for our opinions, or our opinions for our principles?_ We need not say that we chose the latter, believing that our principles were superior to our opinions. Hence, since we launched this venture, we have been forced to discard some opinions once as dear to us as they now are to those who have never contemplated the difference between principle and opinion.

Some of these opinions — (just as the most delicate buds are often quickest to wither in the frost) — immediately faded and died upon the first application of our principles. Infant baptism and infant sprinkling, with all infant imbecility, quickly perished in our minds, as soon as the _Bible_ alone was established as the only measure and standard of faith and duty. This subverted the foundation of the Paidobaptist temple, leading to the entire edifice collapsing into ruins. We diligently explored the ruins, collecting all the materials that could be rebuilt into the Christian temple; yet the piles of debris that remained were immense.

Other topics became the subject of discussion; and as the public mind became more informed and open, the great principles of the Law and Gospel, the Patriarchal, the Jewish, and Christian Institutions were gradually unfolded. The development of these principles was greatly aided by additional publications in 1816 and 1820; and by 1823, ancient and modern Christianity had been so thoroughly explored that the idea was proposed to start a periodical and establish a press to advocate for the original faith and order, in opposition to all the corruptions of fifteen centuries.

As we are not writing a history of this struggle from its inception to the present time, but simply informing the reader that the principles stated in the following pages have been maturely considered and have endured a long, complicated, and vigorous opposition — we shall hasten to the object of this book, which is to present to the reader a compact view of the principles already mentioned.

To speak nothing of the periodicals that have already begun and which have long been our fellow-workers in this vital endeavor, in addition to our publications of 1820, 1823, and 1829, four editions of the new version of the New Testament, with prefaces, various tables, notes, criticisms, etc.; twelve volumes have been published from our press illustrating and defending these principles; addressing and responding to objections from all sects and many of the most learned and talented individuals in our country.

The *Christian Baptist*, in seven annual volumes, being the first of these publications and providing a gradual development of all these principles as the public mindset and opposition would allow, is, in the judgment of many of our brethren, better suited to the entire community as it exists today than our other writings. I concur with this judgment; and especially to it, as well as to all other publications since commenced, I would refer the reader who is eager to examine these principles more comprehensively and to consider the challenges they have faced.

Having given very candid and thoughtful attention to all that has been presented against these principles, as well as having been warned by the extremes to which some of our friends and fellow believers have carried certain points, I undertake this work with a profound sense of its necessity and with much anticipation for its utility, in presenting a concentrated view of the entire ground we occupy — of correcting certain extremes — of providing new means of defense to those engaged in contending with this generation for primitive Christianity.

Having also attentively considered the most vulnerable sides of every major question, and re-examined the terms and phrases that have caused the most opposition and controversy, whether from our own pen or that of any of our brethren, — our aim is now to offer to the public a more matured view of such cardinal principles necessary for the right interpretation of the Holy Scriptures — both in acquiring and conveying a correct knowledge of the Christian Institution, of such principles requisite for discovering truth and exposing error; as well as in a revised and corrected republication of the principal Extras of the Millennial Harbinger, to lay before the reader the elements of the gospel itself, and of the worship most acceptable to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The work, then, naturally divides itself into three parts: — The first, **The principles by which the Christian Institution may be certainly and satisfactorily ascertained:** the second, **The principles on which all Christians may form one communion:** and the third, **The elements or principles which constitute original Christianity**. Whether this arrangement is most aligned with the order of nature or importance is not the question; it is the order in which we have been compelled to consider these subjects out of necessity.

# 4. Physical Regeneration

Our mortal bodies have yet to experience the regenerating power of the Son of God. This is emphatically referred to as *the glory of his power.* The 'redemption of the body' from the bondage of corruption is the culmination of the new creating energy of Him who possesses immortality. Life and incorruptibility were revealed in and through His resurrection from the dead. It was great to create man in the image of God — greater to redeem his soul from general corruption; but greatest of all, to grant his mortal frame incorruptible and immortal vigor. The power demonstrated in bestowing upon the deceased body of the Son of God incorruptible glory and eternal life is presented by the Apostle Paul as incomparable, surpassing every other divine work within human comprehension. He prays that the minds of Christians may be expanded to grasp this mighty power — that the Father of glory would enlighten their understanding, 'that they might know the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe — according to the working of His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His own right hand in the heavenly places.' Faith in this wondrous operation of God — hope for the riches of the glory of the inheritance of the saints in light — are among the most powerful principles of action that God has ever instilled in the human heart. This is the transcendent hope of the Christian calling, which has imbued all the saints of eternal renown with heroic courage. This better resurrection in prospect has produced heroes that render cowards the boastful leaders of worldly glory. Just as the magnetic needle always points to the pole, the mind, influenced by this hope, continually reaches toward the skies, culminating in fullness of joy and eternal pleasure in the presence and at the right hand of God.

To raise a dead body to life is not portrayed as more glorious than, with a mere touch, restoring vigor to a paralyzed arm, granting sight to the blind, or hearing to the deaf; but to give that revived body the undying vigor of incorruptibility, to renew and transform it in all its aspects, and to ensure every spirit feels that it reanimates its own body, making it as impervious to decay and as immortal as the Eternal Father, is a thought overwhelming for every mind, a development that will glorify the power of God as the sacrifice of His Son now reveals His righteousness, faithfulness, and love to heaven and earth.

This new birth from the dark prison of the grave is aptly termed 'the redemption of the body' from bondage, *'the glorious liberty of the children of God.*' Just as in our watery grave the old self is symbolically buried to rise no more, so in the literal grave, the prison of the body, we relinquish everything that is corrupt; for He who makes all things new will raise us up in His likeness and present us before His Father's face in all the glory of immortality. Then regeneration will be complete. Then will come the full revelation of the children of God.

Immortality, in the sacred writings, is never applied to the spirit of man. It is not the doctrine of Plato that the resurrection of Jesus proposes. It is the *immortality of the body* of which His resurrection is a proof and pledge. This was never fully realized until He became the firstborn from the dead and entered heaven in a human body. Jesus was not a spirit when He returned to God. He is not made the Head of the New Creation as a Spirit but as the Son of Man. Our nature in His person is glorified, and when He appears for our salvation, we shall be made like Him: we shall see Him as He is. This is the Christian hope.

- A hope so great and so divine
  
  May trials well endure,
  
  And purge the soul from sense and sin,  As Christ Himself is pure."

Thus, matters stand in the economy of redemption. Thus the divine scheme of regeneration is completed: the moral aspect, by the operation of moral means; the physical aspect, by the mighty power of God working through physical means. By the word of His power, He created the heavens and the earth; by the word of His grace, He reanimates the soul of man; and by the word of His power, He will again create our bodies anew, reuniting the spirit and the body in the bonds of an incorruptible and everlasting union. Then shall death "be swallowed up forever" *"Where now is your victory, boasting grave?"* But for this, we must wait. 'We do not know what we shall be.' We only know that when He appears, we shall be like Him; we shall see Him as He is.

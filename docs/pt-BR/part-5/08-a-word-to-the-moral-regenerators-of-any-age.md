# 8. A Word to the Moral Regenerators of Any Age

God, our heavenly Father, works through means, as we all acknowledge. His means are wisely suited to the ends He aims to achieve. His agents are the best equipped for the tasks He has set before them. He does not use physical means or agents to achieve moral ends and purposes, nor does He create physical effects through moral means and agents. Instead, He has chosen to engage not angels, but humans, in the work of transforming the world. For nearly two thousand years, humans have written, printed, and published the gospel. They have passed it down from generation to generation. They have translated it from language to language and carried it from country to country. They have preached it in both word and deed, and thus it has continued to our present day.

During the current administration of the reign of Heaven, no change is to be expected; no new mission is to be initiated, nor is there to be a new order of preachers established. The King has gone to a far country; and before His departure, He gathered His servants and entrusted them with the management of His estate until He returns. He has not yet come to hold them accountable. They were commanded first to proclaim the doctrine of His reign; then to write it in a book and deliver it to faithful men who would teach it correctly to others. Through these faithful individuals, the records have been preserved, and thanks to their vigilance and industry, they have been protected from corruption, interpolation, and change. One generation has handed them down to the next; and if ignorant and unfaithful copyists have neglected their duty, others more faithful have corrected them; and now we are able to hear the words spoken by Jesus and to read the very sentences penned by the Apostles.

Thus, whatever the Prophets and the Apostles have accomplished since their deaths has been achieved through human agents like ourselves. Where humans have not conveyed this knowledge through speech or writing, none of our kind knows God or His anointed Savior. No angel or Holy Spirit has been sent to the pagan nations, and God has not exerted any power outside of His word to enlighten or reclaim barbaric nations. These undeniable facts and truths carry significant moral weight and ought to strongly motivate our efforts to regenerate the world.

The best means of achieving this is the objective now before us; and its importance cannot be easily overstated. There are three ways of addressing this situation that currently attract considerable public attention: *theorizing, declaiming,* and *preaching.* We may offer a remark or two on each as we pass.

The *theorizers* are those who constantly speculate about correct notions or the true theory of conversion. They are great masters of method, and for some, it is a grievous error to place faith before regeneration or repentance after faith. Heresy, for these individuals, is the disruption of the method they propose for God to use in converting the sinner. The true faith that is linked with salvation is an understanding of this theory and agreement with it. They are all theorists—heady or speculative Christians; for them, the entire *scheme* of redemption is a grand theory.

Our maxim is, *Theory for the Doctors, and medicine for the sick.* Doctors thrive on theories, but patients perish who rely on theory for healing. A few grains of practice outweigh a pound of theory. The mason and the carpenter *build* the house by *rules,* but those who inhabit it *live* by *eating* and *drinking.* No man has ever been healed physically, politically, morally, or religiously by simply learning a correct theory of his physical, political, moral, or religious affliction. We might as soon expect to heal a liver ulcer by discussing that organ, its functions, diseases, and cures, as to restore a sinner through the theory of faith, repentance, regeneration, or effectual calling. But enough has already been said on this topic, more than enough to convince those who can think and dare to reason on such matters.

*Declaimers* are not only those who praise virtue and condemn vice, but also a large and respectable class who appeal to the passions, hopes, and fears of people. They are those who are so rhetorical about the joys of heaven and the terrors of hell—who horrify, terrify, and entice through their strong descriptions, the nuances of their voices, the intensity of their gestures, and their touching anecdotes. Their listeners are either moved to tears or seized with fear. These individuals focus much on the heart; according to their theory, if a man's heart were extracted, all his religion would go with it. The religion of their converts flows in their blood and is founded on their passions.

The *preachers,* in the proper sense, first appeal to the understanding through a declaration or narrative of the wonderful works of God. They state, illustrate, and prove the great facts of the gospel; they present the entire record to their audience; and once they have testified to what God has done, what He has promised and threatened, they exhort their listeners based on these premises and persuade them to obey the gospel, to submit to the guidance and direction of the Son of God. They aim at the whole person—his understanding, will, and affections—and they approach the heart by first addressing the citadel of thought.

An accomplished and wise proclaimer of the word will always find it wise to address his audience according to their proper character; to approach them through their prejudices, and never to criticize those preconceptions that do not directly oppose the intent and purpose of the ministry of reconciliation. He will present the models found in sacred history that show that the same message is not to be preached in every place and to every assembly, even when it is essential to proclaim the same gospel. Paul’s addresses to the Athenians, Lycaonians, Antiochians, to Felix, the jailer, and King Agrippa are full of guidance on this topic.

Augustine wrote a treatise on preaching, which Luther held as a model; however, it is said that Augustine fell as far short of his own precepts as did any of his contemporaries. We often find it easier to give guidelines to others than to follow them ourselves. In Augustine’s treatise, which influenced and shaped the style and approach of Luther, and through him all Protestants, there is much discussion on the best rhetorical mode of "exhibiting the truth to others," but it leans more toward the art of the schoolmen than the wisdom of the Apostles. He focuses more on style and expression than on the substance of what needs to be said.

Our best guidelines in this matter come more from the books of Deuteronomy and Nehemiah than from any other source outside the New Testament. The book of Deuteronomy can be regarded as a series of sermons or discourses delivered to the Jews by their great teacher, Moses, rather than merely a part of Jewish history. Two aspects of this book deserve great consideration. The first is the simplicity, fullness, and specificity of his accounts of the events during their journey through the wilderness—God’s actions and theirs over the last forty years are presented clearly and faithfully. The second aspect is how these facts are utilized; the conclusions drawn, the arguments made, and the exhortations offered from these facts. For a fine and enlightening example, let the curious reader pick up and carefully read the first four chapters of Deuteronomy. The facts and the applications, the arguments, and exhortations as crafted by Moses will surely instruct him.

The writings of the scribes during the captivity teach us how to engage with a people who have lost the true meaning of the oracles of God. The readings, explanations, exhortations, and prayers of Ezra and Nehemiah are rich in instruction for Christians in these days of Babylonish captivity. Addressing a people who have long been accustomed to hearing the Scriptures yet remain ignorant of them, and therefore disobedient, is a task that requires all the wisdom and prudence we can glean from Jewish and Christian records.

The manner of addressing the audience, next to the content, is of utmost importance. The strongest arguments, the most serious appeals, the most heartfelt discussions, if not supported by the gravity, sincerity, and piety of the speaker, will be as ineffective as water spilled on the ground. A little levity, a few jokes, a sarcastic tone, a self-satisfied posture, or a harsh word can often negate all the strengths of the most scriptural and edifying discourse. The great task of regenerating people is too serious, too awfully grave and divine, to allow for such trivialities. Humility, calmness, devotion, and benevolence in demeanor and language are essential for successfully proclaiming the pivotal truths of the Living Oracles. Those who can smile at the follies in their discourse need not weep over the misfortunes of the ignorant and superstitious. Those who can, while preaching the gospel, mock and deride the errors of their fellow believers are, at that moment, unqualified to persuade them to embrace the truth or willingly receive the message of salvation.

Those preachers have been greatly mistaken who sought popularity through eccentricity and courted smiles rather than souls—who, by using anecdotes and foolish jokes while quoting the Bible, imagined they could be useful by making themselves ridiculous, and to regenerate people by teaching them how to disregard the precepts of the gospel and scorn the examples of the Great Teacher and His Apostles.

This will not do. These are the weapons of the world and not part of the armor of light. Jesus and His Apostles never endorsed, by precept or example, such behavior, and it is condemned by all sensible individuals, whether Jews or Gentiles, professing believers or the irreverent.

In attempting to regenerate people, we must showcase the new man, not the old one, in the preacher as well as in the message; and while we seek arguments to convince and attract them, we must clearly demonstrate in our speech and behavior that we believe what we preach. So did the Apostles and Evangelists. They commended themselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of Jesus Christ.

Error must be confronted. It must be opposed by the truth. However, it can be questioned whether the darkness can be more effectively dispelled by introducing light rather than through elaborate discussions on its nature and characteristics. The same applies to moral darkness or error. To eliminate it most effectively, the simplest and quickest method is to bring forth the light of truth. No preacher is required to learn all the errors of all ages to oppose them; nor is a congregation enlightened in the knowledge of God by such exposés of error. Present opposing errors may warrant attention, but to combat these successfully, it is only necessary to emphasize the opposing truths.

This is a serious matter, demanding serious attention. Much hinges on a rational and scriptural determination of the question, *What is the most effective way to oppose and eradicate error?* To assist us in this inquiry, we must examine how the Prophets and Apostles confronted the errors of their times. The world was just as rife with error in those days as it has ever been since. The idolatries of the pagan world and the various doctrines of the philosophical sects, both within and outside of Israel, posed as much challenge to them as the various heresies of fallen Christendom do to us. Their general strategy was to direct the artillery of light against the dark shadows of particular errors. Their philosophy was: the splendors of light most clearly reveal the depths of darkness and disperse it from their presence. Thus, they opposed idolatry, superstition, and every type of error. Armed in the light like the morning sun, the shadows of the night receded, and the warming rays of day so delighted the eyes of their converts that they cherished the light and loathed darkness. Let us go and do likewise.

A thorough acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures is the best preparation for the work of regenerating individuals. The most insightful point I found in Augustine's celebrated treatise on preaching is the following:

"He who handles and teaches the word of God should be a defender of the true faith and a conqueror of error; and in achieving this goal of preaching, he should win over the opposing, motivate the indifferent, and guide the ignorant toward their duties and future prospects. When he finds his audience favorably inclined, attentive, and open, or if he manages to make them so, then additional actions may be necessary, depending on the circumstances. If they are to be instructed, then narration must be employed to familiarize them with the subject at hand, and to clarify what is uncertain, reasoning and evidence must be utilized. If they should be inspired rather than instructed, then to awaken them from apathy and encourage them to fully agree with the truths they acknowledge, the higher powers of eloquence will be needed; it will be vital to entreat, reprove, stimulate, restrain, and do whatever else may prove effective in touching the heart.

"All of this is what most people constantly do concerning the things they seek to achieve through speech. Some, however, are blunt, unimaginative, and inelegant; others, clever, ornate, and intense. Now, the one who engages in the work I am discussing must be able to speak and argue wisely, even if he cannot manage it with eloquence, in order to benefit his audience; although he will certainly do better if he can combine wisdom and eloquence. He who is full of eloquence but lacks wisdom should be regarded with caution, as the hearer may delight in what is ultimately useless to hear and mistakenly believe what is said to be true simply because it is expressed beautifully. This sentiment did not escape the attention of the ancients who still valued rhetoric; they acknowledged that wisdom without eloquence was of little benefit to states, while eloquence without wisdom served them no good and often proved highly detrimental. Therefore, if those who instructed on the principles of eloquence—despite being ignorant of the true, that is, the heavenly wisdom 'which comes down from the Father of lights'—were compelled by the truth to make such an acknowledgment, even in the very texts where their principles were laid out, are we not under far greater obligation to confess the same, being the children of this divine wisdom? Now a person speaks with greater or lesser wisdom based on how well they know the sacred Scriptures. I do not mean merely reading them and memorizing them, but rightly understanding them and diligently seeking their meaning. Some read but neglect them—who read to remember the words but fail to understand their significance. Doubtless, those who retain fewer words of Scripture but seek their true meaning with the deepest feelings of the heart are to be preferred. Even better is one who can quote them at will, while also understanding them as they should be understood."

Luther's favorite maxim was, "*Bonus Textuarius, Bonus Theologus;*" meaning that one well-versed in the Scriptures makes a good theologian.

There is one thing above all that must never escape the attention of anyone who dedicates themselves to the work of regeneration. This crucial consideration is that the ultimate aim of all their efforts is *to impress the moral image of God upon the moral nature of man.* To imprint this image on the heart, to transform the human mind into the likeness of God in all moral feeling, is the objective outlined in the remedial system. The mold into which the mind of man must be shaped is the teaching of the Apostles; or the seal by which this impression is made is the testimony of God. The gospel facts act as types, which, when methodically arranged by a skilled typesetter, create a complete impression; upon which, when the mind of man is placed with the power God has given to the preacher, every type fully impresses itself on the heart. The will or law of our Father in heaven is inscribed on the understanding and engraved on the heart.

The Apostles were these skilled typesetters who provided us with a *perfect 'form of sound words.'* Our role is to guide the minds of men to this form or to imprint it upon their hearts. To do this most effectively, the preacher or evangelist must have the word of Christ abundantly present within him, in all wisdom; he must 'study to show himself an approved workman, irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of truth.' He who is most eloquent and wise in the Holy Scriptures, who commands them most readily, will have the greatest influence with people; as being equipped with the words of the Holy Spirit, he possesses the very arguments which the Spirit of God chooses to use in reviving the dead in converting sinners. For the effectiveness of the living word is not only affirmed by Paul, but James and Peter also bear ample testimony: 'Of his own will, He has begotten us, *by the word of truth,* that we might be a kind of first fruits of His creatures.' 'Having been regenerated, not by corruptible seed, but by incorruptible, *through the word* of the living God, which remains.' To the fruits of his labors, such a preacher can say with Paul, 'Through the gospel, I have regenerated you, or begotten you, to Jesus Christ.'

Thus, amid many interruptions, we have sought to present to our readers the complete doctrine of Regeneration, in all its length and breadth, in the hope that, after a more thorough examination of its meaning and value, and with God's blessing, they may devote themselves more successfully to this great task; and not only enjoy more of the Holy Spirit themselves but also be more effective in fostering the moral regeneration of the world.

To God our Father, through the great Author of the Christian faith, who has kept us in good health in this time of suffering and distress, be everlasting thanks for renewing our minds by the Holy Spirit, and for the hope of the regeneration of our bodies, and of the heavens and the earth, at the arrival of the Almighty Regenerator, who comes to make all things new! Amen.

12 It may again be necessary in this fastidious age to remark that in this essay, in order to clarify the public understanding of our use and acceptance of the term *regeneration,* we have taken the broadest approach that a supreme regard for the apostolic style permits. While we argue that the phrase *bath of regeneration* (Titus 3:5) is equivalent to *immersion,* as previously explained, and distinct from the *renewing of the Holy Spirit,* of which the immersed believer is a proper subject; we have spoken of the entire process of renewal, not strictly applying the phrase of Titus 3:5, but rather encompassing the broad figure employed by the Apostle. It is not merely the first act of begetting, nor the last act of being born, but the complete process of conversion that is referred to in the figure of *generation,* to which we have drawn attention in our writing. For, as previously stated, our opponents deceive themselves and their adversaries by misrepresenting our views as if we attribute to the word *immersion,* and the act of immersion, all that they term *regeneration.* While we assert that being 'born again' and being immersed are, in the Apostle's perspective, two names for the same action, we do not claim that there is nothing necessary in the formation of the new man besides being born.

If anyone wonders why this matter was not fully elaborated in our initial essays on the topic, our answer is that we could not have foreseen that our opponents would have so misrepresented our views. Were a General asked why he did not organize all his troops at the outset as he organized them at the time of his triumph over the enemy, he would respond that the enemy's movements dictated the positioning of his forces.

Our opponents support a regeneration that is both begun and perfected before faith or baptism—a spiritual change of mind by the Holy Spirit, prior to any knowledge, faith, or repentance, of which infants are just as susceptible as adults; and thus, we contend, undermine the effectiveness of the gospel. In return, they would have their converts think that we rely only on water, sarcastically dubbing us advocates of "water regeneration." They believe there is something more sublime and divine in "spirit regeneration," claiming the title of orthodox. This calumny has prompted the creation of the present essay and led us to broadly define *regeneration* in a manner that aligns with the analogies presented by the Apostle. However, when we speak with the precise language of the living oracles on this subject, we must represent *being born again* (John 3:5) and *regeneration* (Titus 3:5) as relating solely to the act of immersion. See *Extra Defended,* pp. 24-36.

13 *August* 1*st.* — I have just now opened the Cincinnati *Baptist Journal* of July 26, from which I read an accepted definition of regeneration. It is orthodox, spiritual, physical, mystical, and metaphysical. Regeneration in the *Evangelical Standard* is defined as follows: —

- Is the sinner active in regeneration? Certainly he is. His mind is a thinking rational entity that never ceases to act; thus, when the term *passive* is applied to it by old theologians or Calvinists, they do not mean it is *literally* dead, like inert matter requiring a physical impulse to initiate motion. They only mean to convey the scriptural idea that the Holy Spirit is the *sole* agent in regeneration and that the sinner has no more *efficient agency* in accomplishing it than Lazarus did in being brought back to life. Still, they acknowledge that his mind is highly active, yet unfortunately its activity is all *against* the Divine influence, as the Scriptures assure us that unregenerated individuals 'do always resist' the Spirit’s strivings. 'Every* imagination of the thoughts of man’s heart is *only* evil continually.' 'There is none that doeth good, no, *not one.*' Therefore, instead of willingly cooperating with the Holy Spirit, the sinner does everything he can to *resist* the Divine influence and *prevent* his own regeneration until he is *made* willing by almighty power."

What a comforting notion this theory of regeneration is! The sinner is to be regenerated while actively resisting the Divine influence. At the moment of regeneration, "he has," in one sense, "no more efficient agency in accomplishing it than Lazarus had in becoming alive from the dead;" and in another sense, he is not passive but "does all he can to *resist* the Divine influence and *prevent* his own regeneration until he is *made* willing by almighty power." This is *standard* theology; and anyone preaching this divinity is considered a pious, regenerated, Regular Orthodox Baptist Minister! What value, according to this theory, can all of Christendom's preaching hold? The Holy Spirit may be actively working on some drunken sot or vile debauchee, who is as dead as Lazarus on one side, while on the other, he is resisting the Spirit with all his moral and physical energy until the Almighty arm pierces him to the heart with a sword and makes him alive by first killing him!!!

The absurdity and licentiousness of such a view of the great work of renewal seemed so glaring that we believed no editor in the West would dare publish it. This illustrates the necessity of our present essay and provides insight to the discerning reader as to why we have referred to the entire process of renewal as regeneration, a term that rightly pertains to the final act.

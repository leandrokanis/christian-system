# 1. Regeneration

- "I create New Heavens and a New Earth." Isa 65:18.
- "Behold, I make all things new." Rev. 21:5.

We intend to write an essay on "the seeds of things." The topic is not only a common one, but also a familiar and interesting one. Much has been said and written about it; and yet it remains no better understood than it should be. Few people take the time to think deeply about what they believe they understand; and many prefer to follow the thoughts of others rather than think for themselves. Uncertainty is uncomfortable; much study can wear one down; and thus, the majority are satisfied with the views and opinions passed down from those who came before them.

We wish to discuss this subject as if it were entirely new, examining it now as if we had never looked at it before. It deserves that attention. Generation is filled with wonders, for it reveals God's physical magnificence; yet regeneration is even more remarkable because it shows the moral attributes of Jehovah. However, our goal is not to delve into its wonders but to provide a clear, common-sense, scriptural explanation of its significance.

We have not learned our theology from Athanasius, nor our morality from Seneca; therefore, we will not call upon them for illustration, argument, or proof. We look for insight in the Sacred Records, where Christianity remains vibrant; and we direct the readers' attention there. It is not the regeneration of the schools, where Christianity has been diminished, misunderstood, obscured, and corrupted, that we will discuss; but rather that regeneration which Jesus spoke of and the Apostles wrote about.

A few things must be stated — a few general views expressed — before we, or our readers, are prepared for the more detailed discussions: and to approach the subject swiftly and without ceremony, we observe that —

Unregenerate man is ruined in body, soul, and spirit; a fragile and mortal being. From Adam, his father, he inherits a shattered constitution. He is the child of a fallen ancestor; a descendant of a degenerate lineage.

None of Adam’s descendants can rise above him as the exile from Eden in terms of physical, intellectual, and moral nature. Nature cannot improve itself; for above its source, the stream cannot rise. Cain, the firstborn of Eve, was in nature the image and likeness of his father. Education failed to elevate him, while Abel, his younger brother, attained the excellence that faith in God's promise alone provides. The firstborn, it can be agreed, was at least equal to his younger brother; and who can claim that he excels Eve's eldest son in nature?

However, man in his ruined state is a suitable subject for a remedial system. He is capable of renewal. Therefore, God has placed him under a regenerating framework. This framework aims at the regeneration of the entire human constitution, proposing as its culmination the transformation of spirit, soul, and body. The destiny of the regenerate is summarized by Paul in one sentence: "As we now bear the image of the earthly Adam, we shall then bear the image of the heavenly Adam."

God's own Son is presented as a model. Conformity to Him in glory, honor, and immortality, as the perfection of the regenerate, is the predestination of the one who speaks of things that are not as though they were.

Regeneration is therefore both moral and physical: or, in other words, there is now a renovation of the mind — of understanding, will, and affections; — and there will eventually be a renewal of the body: "For this corruptible body shall put on incorruption, and this mortal body shall put on immortality."

The renewal of the mind and character is, therefore, that moral regeneration which must be achieved in this life; for which the remedial system, or kingdom of heaven, was established on earth; and this, therefore, demands our immediate attention.

Before we attempt a detailed answer to the question, _How is this moral regeneration accomplished?_ we must first address the principle upon which the entire remedial system operates. The grand principle, or means, that God has adopted for achieving this moral regeneration is the full demonstration and proof of a single proposition addressed to the reason of man. This sublime proposition is, **that God is love**.

The reason and wisdom of this approach will be evident to anyone who can comprehend the views and feelings of all unregenerate humanity. A person in a state of alienation and rebellion naturally suspects that if they are a sinner and if God hates sin, then He must hate them. As love begets love; so hatred begets hatred; and if a sinner suspects that God hates them, they cannot love God. They must know that God loves them before they can begin to love Him. "We," says an Apostle, "love God because He first loved us." — While their heart is alienated, due to the innate darkness of their understanding, the sinner misinterprets every restriction that God has placed in their path to prevent their complete ruin, as indications of divine wrath. Their transgression of these restrictions and their awareness of having defied God’s truth and power only heighten their hostility and push them further into apostasy and estrangement from their Creator. Misunderstanding God’s goodness provides no incentive for repentance and reformation. Guilt, fear, and shame, the fruits of their rebellion, cloud their understanding and hide from their eyes all evidence of benevolence and kindness present in creation. Adam hiding among the trees, trembling with fear, suspicious of the movements of every leaf, and covered with shame like a garment, serves both as an illustration and proof of this mentality that prevails among the unregenerate.

Neither the volume of creation nor that of God's providence is sufficient to dispel from the natural man these misconceptions and the resultant alienation of heart. The best indication that these two volumes cannot accomplish this is that they have never succeeded in any instance. The nature of things makes it evident that they cannot do so. Elements often work against humanity's happiness. The ever-changing conditions of nature concerning health, life, and comfort raise doubts about whether the laws that ultimately lead humanity to the grave stem from benevolence or malevolence towards mankind. A third volume, one that explains both and is filled with supernatural revelations, is needed to provide the most diligent student of nature and providence with the means of understanding the true and full character of the God against whom we have rebelled.

That volume is the Bible. Holy Prophets and Apostles spoke as they were moved by the Spirit of Knowledge and Revelation. Its records, its history, its prophecies, its precepts, its laws, its ordinances, and its examples all reveal God to humanity, and humanity to itself.

But it is within the person and mission of the **Incarnate Word** that we learn that _God is love_. That God gave His Son for us, and continues to give His Spirit to us — this presents to us the mysterious and transcendent evidence of the most profound proposition in the universe. The gospel, the combined wisdom and power of Heaven, God's own plan for renewing human nature, is nothing less than the illustration and proof of this regenerative proposition.

Thus we turn our attention to our subject. Having noted the significant markers of nature and grace, we are now ready to, under the illumination of truth, ascertain the true and divinely taught doctrine of regeneration. We will cautiously survey the entire process as revealed by those commissioned to teach the profound counsels of the one true God.

The certain elements, parts of this grand progression, can be well understood, and certain terms that we typically use to represent them must be distinctly defined and accurately understood. These terms include **Fact, Testimony, Faith, Repentance, Reformation, Bath of Regeneration, New Birth, Renewing of the Holy Spirit, Newness of Life.**^1

"All things are from God" in the regeneration of humanity is our guiding principle; because our Apostle affirmed this as a foundational truth. He is the author of the *facts* and the *testimony* that declares them; and being the author of these, He is the author of all the effects produced by these facts. The Christian is a new *creation*, of which God is the *Creator*. The change of heart and character that constitutes moral regeneration is the legitimate outcome of the facts — the things that God has accomplished. The facts are the moral seal that stamps the image of God upon humanity. In the natural order, we must place them first; therefore, we must first define the term.

## Repentance

Repentance is usually defined as *sorrow for anything that is past*; and in religious terms, it is simply *sorrow for sin*. This is one definition, but it is only one of the natural outcomes of believing the testimony of God. The gospel facts, testimony, and faith encompass more than this. Nevertheless, it is necessary that this point of faith be clearly understood, especially in this age when it occupies such a prominent space in theological systems.

Repentance, in our current understanding, is sorrow for sin; and certainly, no one who believes the revealed facts in the testimony of God will not feel sorrowful for their sins. However, simple sorrow for the past is merely an emotional response; unless it inspires reformation or a decision to abandon sin, it is as useless as Judas’ regrets after selling his Master for thirty pieces of silver. Repentance must precede reformation; for unless we feel sorrow for the past and are troubled by our actions, we will not consider changing our behavior. Repentance is to reformation what motive is to action or resolution to any undertaking. It was commendable for David to resolve to build the temple; just as it is good to form any noble intention; but it is far better to carry it out. To feel pity for the poor and suffering, and to resolve to assist and comfort them, is laudable; but to go and do it is far superior: indeed, unless our sorrow for the past culminates in reformation for the future, it is worthless in the sight of Heaven and Earth; as pointless as telling the hungry, "Be filled"; or the naked, "Be clothed."

Genuine repentance does not always lead to reformation. Judas was sorrowful to the point of death but could not change his ways. Many have experienced true sorrow for their sins, to the extent that they took their own lives. Are we speaking of "a godly sorrow?" No: this cannot be expected from those who are unconverted and ungodly. Christians, as Paul teaches, when they err, may repent with a godly sorrow; but this cannot be expected from the unregenerate or from those who have not reformed. It is not the genuineness of repentance that is to be appreciated, unless "genuine repentance" means more than mere sorrow for the past — it must also involve reformation. Yet, without sincere or genuine repentance, there cannot be true reformation.

This leads us to observe that the only clear evidence of sincere repentance is the actual rectification of the harm done; not only a cessation from sin, but restitution for the sin, as far as restitution is possible. _No restitution, no repentance — if restitution can be made_. And I may be permitted to add, _that without repentance and restitution, when possible, there can be no forgiveness_.

Preachers of repentance — of the necessity of repentance for forgiveness — should present this matter fairly and thoroughly to sinners. Do they describe repentance as sorrow for the past and a commitment to reform? How then will the sinner know that they are truly sorry for their sins against others, or how will the community know of their repentance, unless full restitution has been made? It is impossible for either the sinner or the community who are aware of these sins to have any solid evidence of penance, without making all possible restitution.

Peccator wounded the reputation of his neighbor Hermas and, on another occasion, defrauded him of ten pounds. — Some in the neighborhood were aware of these wrongs. Peccator converted under the preaching of Paulinus and, in recounting his sorrow for his sins, spoke of the depth of his convictions and his abhorrence of his transgressions. He was accepted into the congregation and sat down with the faithful to commemorate the great sin offering. Hermas and his neighbors witnessed all this. They saw that Peccator was penitent and noticeably improved in his behavior; but they could not believe his sincerity because he had made no restitution. They regarded him either as a hypocrite or self-deceived; because, having the means, he did not repay the ten pounds nor corrected the slanders he had propagated. Peccator, however, felt little joy in his profession and soon fell back into his former ways. He became penitent again and, reflecting on the reasons for his fall, realized he had never truly turned away from his sins. Overwhelmed with sorrow for the past, he resolved to commit himself fully to the Lord; and, reflecting on his past life, began the work of reformation earnestly. He called on Hermas, reimbursed him his ten pounds, plus interest for every day he had withheld it, approached all the individuals he had slandered, admitted the injustice he had done to Hermas, and asked them, if they had relayed it to anyone else, to refute it. He visited several others he had wronged in his dealings and fully corrected those wrongs against his neighbors. He also confessed them to the Lord and sought His forgiveness. Peccator was then restored to the church; and better still, he enjoyed a peace of mind and confidence in God, which was a continual joy. Moreover, his example did more to grow the congregation at the Cross-roads than the preaching of Paulinus did in an entire year. This was unequivocally _sincere_ repentance.

This is the repentance that Moses preached and which Jesus approved. Under the law, confession to the priest and the presentation of a trespass offering were of no avail for forgiveness without restitution. But the law went into even more detail than this; for provision was made for cases where the sinner could not locate the person they had sinned against. In such cases, the penitent sinner was to seek out the relatives of the injured party, and if they could find any relative, they were to repay that relative; but if they could not find anyone, they must compensate to the Lord, in addition to offering their trespass offering. This would be placed in the Lord’s treasury.^2 The principle in all cases of sin against humanity was that the sinner "shall make amends for the harm they have done, and shall add a fifth part to it."^3

If anyone believes that repentance should be any less sincere or unequivocal under the gospel, let them remember that Zaccheus proposed more than just a fifth; he was willing to restore fourfold, and Jesus approved of this action. Indeed, John the Immerser demanded fruits worthy of repentance or reformation, and Paul proclaimed that those who turned to God should do works appropriate for, or worthy of, repentance.^4

"Works worthy of repentance" is a phrase that can only be understood to mean those works that rectify the harm done to others as well as to God, to the best of one’s ability. Can anyone believe they are genuinely remorseful for a sin or wrong they have committed if they make no effort to rectify it for the injured party, be it in person, character, or property? They lack works commensurate with their claimed repentance as long as any individual they have wronged remains unaddressed to the fullest extent of their capacity.

One of our most popular commentators states — and with much truth — "No one should expect mercy at the hand of God if they, having wronged their neighbor, refuse to make *restitution* when they have the means. Even if they were to weep tears of blood, both God's justice and mercy would deny their prayer if they do not make amends for the injury done to their neighbor. A dishonest man is one who unlawfully holds another's property."^5

Every preacher of repentance should emphasize these proofs of sincerity for the satisfaction of the penitent themselves and for the good of the community. "Many who believed came and confessed, and showed their deeds; many who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they calculated the value of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver."^6 This was making restitution as far as was possible in their case; and the principle observed here applies to every other situation.

However, in discussing this topic so far, we have occasionally crossed the boundaries of repentance and sometimes confused it with reformation. This confusion arises from the careless use of language, to which modern theology has significantly contributed. We will, however, attempt to correct this misunderstanding by making a few remarks on

## Reformation

The word *metanoia*, used by the sacred writers and divinely inspired preachers of the New Covenant, as indicative of the first effect of faith, as has often been demonstrated, is different from what our term *repentance* accurately represents. It literally means *a change of mind*; but, as Parkhurst, Campbell, and many others have noted, "such a change of mind influences one's subsequent behavior for the better." "It has been noted by some, and I think rightly so, that the former (*metanoeo*) properly denotes a change for the better: the latter (*metamelomai*) merely indicates a change, whether for better or worse; that the former signifies a change of mind that is durable and produces consequences; the latter expresses only a present uneasy feeling of regret, without concern for duration or effects: in summary, the former can be translated into English as *I reform*; the latter, as *I repent*, in the traditional sense of the terms." Now, since everyone who reforms *repents*; yet not everyone who repents does *reform*, this distinction is necessary and appropriate, and there is nothing risky, nothing lost in translating the former as *I reform*, and the latter as *I repent*. There is something gained, particularly where we have the word in the imperative mood because, in that case, it is essential to know precisely what is being intended. If we are only commanded to change our minds, or to feel regret for the past, then we have complied when we feel remorse; but if more than a simple change of mind or regret is intended, we have not obeyed the command until we change for the better. Now, we believe, it is evident from various passages in the sacred writings of the Apostles, as well as their speeches, that they demanded more than just a simple change of mind regarding past conduct, or mere sorrow for the past. Peter commanded the thousands gathered on Pentecost, who had changed their minds and were sorrowful for the past, to do something they had not yet done; and that something is rendered in the common version as *repent*; in the new version, *reform*; and in the old English Bible, *amend your lives*. The word used here is the imperative form of *metanoeo*. Judas repented, as did many like him, yet never reformed; therefore, it is crucial that we keep this distinction in mind.^7

Repentance is not reformation, but it is necessary for it; for whoever reforms must first repent. Reformation is, in fact, the implementation of the purpose within our conduct. But as reformation pertains more to a subsequent part of our essay than to the present, we will now pause and offer a few reflections based on the premises already presented.

In the preceding definitions of words and concepts, it would seem that we have literally and unfiguratively represented the whole process of what is figuratively termed *regeneration*. For, as we shall see shortly, the term *regeneration* is a metaphor that appropriately, although analogically, depicts the reformation or renewal of life we have just discussed.

That the preceding arrangement is not arbitrary, but natural and necessary, will become clear when the reader considers that the performed action, or the fact, must come before the report or testimony about it; that the testimony must precede belief in it; that belief in the testimony must predicate any feelings aligned with the fact testified; and that those feelings must precede actions that conform to them. Therefore, Fact, Testimony, Faith, Feeling, and Action are intrinsically connected by a natural and gracious necessity that no ingenuity can divide. And will not every Christian recognize that when a person *feels* and *acts* according to faith, or according to the testimony of God, they are a new creation — regenerate — truly converted to God? The individual who believes in the facts testified in God’s record, comprehends them, feels according to their nature and meaning, and acts in accordance with them, has undergone a change of heart and life that makes them a new person.

This embodies that moral change of heart and life, which is figuratively called *regeneration*. We should not presume that regeneration is something that must be added to the faith, the feeling, and the action or behavior that are outcomes of the testimony of God understood and accepted; nor should it be viewed as separate from the divine facts attested by Prophets and Apostles. Rather, it is merely another term for the same process in all its components.

It is also worthwhile to note that various figures and analogies are employed by the inspired writers to illustrate this change, as well as other essential truths and lessons found in the Bible. Collectively, Christians are called a kingdom, a nation, a generation, a family, a house, a flock, a city, a temple, a priesthood, and so forth. Individually, they are referred to as kings, priests, soldiers, citizens, children, sheep, branches, stones, etc. They are said to be begotten, born, regenerated, built, engrafted, converted, created, planted. Now, regardless of the figure under which they are considered or introduced, reason dictates that everything said of them should align with the metaphor under which they are presented. Are they called *sheep?* — Then the one who oversees them is called a *Shepherd*; their foes are *wolves* and *dogs*; their sustenance is the *green pasture*; their safe haven and rest is the *sheepfold*; their mistakes are termed *wanderings* and *strayings*; their conversion is a *return*; and their good behavior involves *heeding* or *following* the Shepherd’s voice. Are they referred to as *children?* — Collectively, they are a *family*; they are *begotten* and *born again*; God is their *Father*; their inclusion is termed an *adoption*; Jesus is their *elder brother*; they are *heirs* of God; they *live* and *walk* with God. Are they *priests?* — Then Jesus is their *High Priest*; the church is their *temple*; the Savior is their *altar*; their songs and praises are *incense* ascending to heaven; and their acts of love towards the poor are *sacrifices* most pleasing to God. Are they called *citizens?* — The church is then the *kingdom of heaven*; Jerusalem is the mother of them all; previously, they were *aliens*, and their naturalization is *regeneration*. Are they called *branches?* — Then Jesus is the *true vine*; His Father is the *vine dresser*; their union with Christ is referred to as an *engrafting*; the discipline of the gospel is a *pruning*; and their good works are viewed as *fruits of righteousness*.

Thus, there is no confusion of metaphors in the Scriptures of truth — in the language of heaven. It is a language of confusion and disorder to mix and confuse all figures and analogies. Hence, we often hear terms like *being born again* used without any reference to a family or kingdom! And we hear *regeneration* described as preceding faith or repentance! Had a modern assembly of theologians been tasked with adapting the scriptural style to their orthodox beliefs, we would not have needed to read all the Old Testament and the historical books of the New Testament to locate the subject of regeneration, as is currently the case; no, we would have encountered it in the narratives of Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham, if not in every segment of the law given to Moses, in the Prophets, and in the Psalms. John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Holy Twelve would have included it in every sermon; and true faith would have always been defined as the result of regeneration.

But Jesus had a *kingdom* in mind when He mentioned being 'born again' to Nicodemus; for unless there was a family, state, or kingdom to be born into, it is impossible for any one to enter it. And if the kingdom of heaven only began after Jesus ascended to heaven; or if it only approached from the ministry of John to the day of Pentecost, then it would have been absurd — an incongruity of which no inspired individual was ever guilty — to define any transformation of heart or life as *regeneration* or a *new birth*. It is true that righteous individuals in all eras were made such by facts, testimony, faith, feelings, and a change of heart, through the Spirit of God; but the *analogy* or *figure* of being *born* or of being *regenerated* only began to be preached when men began to press into it.

We are now, perhaps, better prepared to explore the proper import and meaning of '*regeneration*' in general, and of '*the bath of regeneration*' in particular.

## Regeneration

This term is mentioned only twice in the entire Word of God — once in Matt. 19:28 and once in Titus 3:5. In the former, it is almost universally interpreted to mean *a new state of affairs,* rather than of *individuals* — a unique era, in which all things are made new: such as the establishment of a new church on Pentecost, or the beginning of the Millennium, or the general resurrection. Esteemed biblical critics have attributed it to one or the other of these significant changes in the state of affairs. The most accepted punctuation and version of this passage makes it clear that a new era is being referred to. 'Jesus answered, Truly, I say to you, that at the renewal when the Son of Man shall sit upon His glorious throne, you, My followers, who have accompanied Me, also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.' Given that this is so evident and frequently referenced in our earlier writings, we shall move on to the remaining occurrence in Titus 3:5.

All the new understanding we propose to bring to this passage will stem from an examination of the meaning of the word *generation* in the sacred writings. Our reason for this is that we oppose a definitive declaration on the meaning of a term that only occurs in the verses being discussed based solely on our interpretations of isolated passages. In such instances, if we cannot discover the complete word in any related verses, the appropriate substitute is the root or derivatives of that word, as utilized by the same authors. Furthermore, it may be agreed that whatever may be the biblical interpretation of the word *generation*, regeneration is merely the repetition of that act or process.

After closely examining the instances in which *generation* appears in the writings of the Hebrew Prophets and Apostles, we find it employed in only two senses — as a descriptor of the entire process of creation and of the created entity. A group of humans, or specific classes of men, is referred to as a *generation*; but this represents its figurative rather than its literal meaning. Its literal implication is the process or act of creation. Thus, it is first used in the Holy Scriptures. Moses refers to the creation or entire act of forming the heavens and the earth as 'The *generations* of the heavens and the earth.'^8 The accounts of the creation of Adam and Eve, as well as the creation stories themselves, are, by the same author, called 'The book or record of the *generations* of Adam.'^9 This is the literal meaning of the term; therefore, *regeneration* literally represents the complete process of renewing or recreating humanity.

This process may consist of various distinct acts; however, it is consistent with general usage to refer to the beginning or final act by the name of the entire process. Generally speaking, though, the name of the entire process is often assigned to the culminating act because the process is always thought to be incomplete until that act is achieved. For instance, in the processes of tanning, fulling, forging, etc., the subject of these operations is not deemed to be tanned, fulled, forged until the last act is performed. Similarly, in all processes in nature — whether in the animal, vegetable, or mineral realms — the final act concludes the process. To those familiar with processes like animalization, germination, crystallization, etc., no further argument is needed. However, as articulated by our American farmers, no crop or animal is *completed* until it matures. We often hear them remark that a good rainfall or a few clear days are "the *making* of the wheat or corn." In the same way, most Christians refer to *regeneration* as **the new birth**; although *being born* is merely the final act in natural generation, as well as the last act in regeneration.

Thus, the terms *new birth* and *regeneration* are often used interchangeably by theologians and writers, and the metaphorical basis for this is supported by well-established principles of rhetoric. This encourages us to speak specifically about the next chapter.

# 2. The Bath of Regeneration

By '*the bath of regeneration*' is not meant the first, second, or third act; but the last act of regeneration, which completes the whole; and is, therefore, used to denote the new birth. This is the reason why our Lord and his Apostles associate this act with water. Being *born of water,* in the Savior's terminology, and *the bath of regeneration,* in the Apostles' terminology, in the judgment of all notable writers and critics, refer to one and the same act — namely: Christian baptism. Hence it came to pass that *all the ancients* (as fully evidenced in our first Extra on Remission) used the word *regeneration* as synonymous in meaning with *immersion.* In addition to the numerous quotations made in our Essay on Remission from the creeds and liturgies of Protestant churches, we shall add another from the Common Prayer of the Church of England, clearly showing that the learned Doctors of that church used the words *regeneration* and *baptism* as synonymous. In the address and prayer of the minister after the baptism of the child, he is mandated to say, —   

"Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that this child is regenerate, and grafted into the body of Christ's church, let us give thanks unto Almighty God for these benefits, and with one accord make our prayer unto him that this child may lead the rest of his life according to this beginning." 

"Then shall it be said, all kneeling — " 

"We yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath pleased thee to regenerate this infant with thy Holy Spirit, to receive him as thine own child by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy church. And humbly we beseech thee to grant that he, being dead to sin, and living to righteousness, and being buried with Christ in his death, may crucify the old man, and utterly abolish the whole body of sin; and that, as he is made partaker of the death of thy Son, he may also be partaker of his resurrection; so that finally, with the remainder of the holy church, he may be an inheritor of thine everlasting kingdom, through Christ our Lord. Amen!" 

Eusebius, in his life of Constantine, page 628, shows that St. Cyprian, St. Athanasius, and, indeed, all the Greek Fathers regarded baptism as the consummating act; and therefore they call it *teliosis,* the consummation. These authorities may not hold weight with us; but, since they are significant to our opponents, we think it prudent to remind them which side the Fathers testify in the matter before us. Through these quotations we aim to prove no more than that the ancients *understood* the washing of regeneration, and indeed used the term *regeneration* as synonymous with baptism. 

But were we asked for the precise meaning of the phrase 'washing or bath of regeneration,' either on philological principles or as explained by the Apostles, we would give our judgment that the phrase is a circumlocution or periphrasis for water. It is *loutron,* a word which more properly signifies the vessel that contains the water than the water itself; and is, therefore, rendered *bath* by the most learned critics and translators, as indicative either of the vessel containing the fluid or of the use made of the fluid in the vessel. It is, therefore, by a metonymy, the water of baptism, or the water in which we are regenerated. Paul was Hebrew and spoke in the Hebrew style. We must learn that style before we fully understand the Apostle's style. In other words, we must studiously read the Old Testament before we can accurately comprehend the New. What could be more natural for a Jew accustomed to speak of 'the water of purification,' of 'the water of separation,' to refer to 'the bath of regeneration?' If the phrase 'water of purification' meant water used for the purpose of purifying a person — and if 'the water of separation' meant water used for separating a person, what could be more natural than that 'the bath of regeneration' should mean water used for regenerating a person? 

But the New Testament itself confirms this interpretation of the phrase. We find the word *loutron* used once more by the same Apostle, in the same context of thought. In his letter to the Ephesians, he asserts that Jesus has sanctified (separated, purified with the water of purification) the church by a *loutron* of water — 'a bath of water, with the word' — 'having cleansed it by a bath of water, with the word.' This is even more decisive. The king's translators, fully aware that the meaning of this passage aligns with Titus 3:5, have used the word *washing* in both places, and Macknight uses the term *bath* as the meaning of *loutron.* What is called the *washing* or *bath of regeneration* in one passage is referred to as 'the washing' or 'bath of water' in the other; what is called '*saved*' in one, is called '*cleansed*' in the other; and what is termed '*the renewal of the Holy Spirit*' in one is described as '*the word*' in the other; because the Holy Spirit consecrates or cleanses through the word. For thus prayed the Messiah, 'Consecrate them through the truth: thy word is the truth.' And again, 'You are clean through the word that I have spoken unto you.' 

To the same effect, Paul, addressing the Hebrew Christians, says, 'Having your hearts sprinkled from a guilty conscience, and your bodies washed with pure water' — the water of purification, the water of regeneration: for the phrase 'pure water' must be understood not in terms of the quality of the water, but metonymically in terms of the effect, the cleansing, the washing, or the purifying of the person — 'having your bodies, or persons *washed* with pure water,' or water that purifies or cleanses. 

No one familiar with Peter's style will find it strange that Paul represents persons as *saved, cleansed,* or *sanctified* by water; seeing that Peter unequivocally asserts that '*we are saved*' through water, or through baptism, as was Noah and his family through water and faith in God's promise. 'The antitype immersion does also now save us.' 

Finally, our great Prophet, the Messiah, gives water the same place and power in the work of regeneration. For when speaking of being *born again* — when explaining to Nicodemus *the new birth,* he says, 'Except a man be *born of water* and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.' May we not, then, supported by such high authorities, refer to that water of which a person is born again, as the water or bath of regeneration? 

## New Birth

We have already seen that the culmination of the process of generation or creation is the birth of the formed creature. So it is in moral generation or in the great process of regeneration. There is a state of existence from which the one who is born passes; and there is a state of existence into which he enters after birth. This is true of the entire animal creation, whether oviparous or viviparous. Now the manner of existence, or mode of life, is wholly changed; and he is, in reference to the former state, dead, and to the new state alive. So it is in moral regeneration. The subject of this profound change existed in one state before his new birth; but after it, he exists in another. He stands in a new relationship to God, angels, and men. He is now born of God and has the privilege of being a son of God, and is consequently pardoned, justified, sanctified, adopted, and saved. The state he left was one of condemnation, what some call "the state of nature." The state into which he enters is one of favor, in which he enjoys all the heavenly blessings through Christ: therefore, it is called 'the kingdom of heaven.' All this is signified in his death, burial, and resurrection with Christ; or in his being born of water. Hence, the necessity of being buried with Christ in water, that he may be born of water, so that he may enjoy the renewal of the Holy Spirit and be placed under the reign of favor. 

*All the means of salvation are means of enjoyment, not of procurement.* Birth itself is not for procurement, but for enjoying the life possessed before birth. So in the analogy — no one is to be baptized, or to be buried with Christ; no one is to be placed under the water of regeneration for the purpose of *procuring* life, but for the purpose of *enjoying* the life of which they are possessed. If a child is never born, all its sensitive powers and faculties cannot be enjoyed; for it is after birth that these are fully developed, and fed upon all the sustenance and objects of sense in nature. Hence all that is *now* promised in the gospel can only be *enjoyed* by those who are born again and placed in the kingdom of heaven under all its influences. Hence the philosophy behind that necessity which Jesus preached — 'Unless a man be born again, he cannot discern the kingdom of heaven' — unless a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into it. 

But let no one think that in the act of being born, either naturally or metaphorically, the child purchases, procures, or merits either life or its enjoyments. He is only, by his birth, placed in circumstances favorable to the enjoyment of life and all that makes life a blessing. 'To as many as receive him, believing in his name, he grants the privilege of being children of God, who derive their birth not from blood, nor from the desire of the flesh, nor from the will of man, but from God.' 

## Renewing of the Holy Spirit

'He has saved us,' says the Apostle Paul, 'by the bath of regeneration and the *renewing of the Holy Spirit,* which he poured on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior; that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.' Thus, and not by works of righteousness, he has saved us. Consequently, being born of water and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are not works of merit or righteousness, but only the means of enjoyment. But this pouring out of influences, this renewing of the Holy Spirit, is as necessary as the bath of regeneration for the salvation of the soul and for the enjoyment of the hope of heaven, of which the Apostle speaks. In the kingdom into which we are born of water, the Holy Spirit is akin to the atmosphere in the kingdom of nature — we mean that the influences of the Holy Spirit are as necessary to *the new life* as the atmosphere is to our physical life in the kingdom of nature. All that is done in us before regeneration, God our Father effects by *the word,* or the gospel as dictated and confirmed by his Holy Spirit. But after we are thus begotten and born by the Spirit of God — after our new birth — the Holy Spirit is poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior; of which the peace of mind, the love, the joy, and the hope of the regenerate are full proof; for these are among the fruits of that Holy Spirit of promise of which we speak.

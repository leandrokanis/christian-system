# 2. The Bath of Regeneration

By '*the bath of regeneration*' is not meant the first, second, or third act; but the last act of regeneration, which completes the whole; and is, therefore, used to denote the new birth. This is the reason why our Lord and his Apostles unite this act with water. Being *born of water,* in the Savior's style, and *the bath of regeneration,* in the Apostles' style, in the judgement of all writers and critics of eminence, refer to one and the same act — viz: christian baptism. Hence it came to pass, that *all the ancients* (as fully proved in our first  Extra  on  Remission)  used  the  word  *regeneration*  as synonymous  in  signification  with  *immersion.*  In  addition  to  the numerous quotations made in our Essay on Remission, from the creeds and liturgies of Protestant churches, we shall add another from  the  Common  Prayer  of  the  Church  of  England,  showing unequivocally  that  the  learned  Doctors  of  that  church  used  the words *regeneration* and *baptism* as synonymous. In the address and prayer of the minister after the baptism  of the child, he is commanded to say, —   

"Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that this child is regenerate, and grafted into the body of Christ's church, let us give thanks unto Almighty God for these benefits, and with one accord make our prayer  unto  him  that  this  child  may  lead  the  rest  of  his  life according to this beginning." 

"Then shall be said, all kneeling — " 

"We yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath pleased  thee  to  regenerate  this  infant  with  thy  Holy  Spirit,  to receive him for thine own child by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy church. And humbly we beseech thee to grant that he, being dead unto sin, and living unto righteousness, and being buried with Christ in his death, may crucify the old man, and utterly  abolish  the  whole  body  of  sin;  and  that  as  he  is  made partaker of the death of thy Son, he may also be partaker of his resurrection; so that finally, with the residue of the holy church, he may be an inheritor of thine everlasting kingdom, through Christ our Lord. Amen!" 

Eusebius,  in  his  life  of  Constantine,  page  628,  shows  that  St. Cyprian, St. Athanasius, and, indeed, all the Greek Fathers, did regard baptism as the consummating act; and therefore they call it *teliosis,* the consummation. These authorities weigh nothing with us; but, as they weigh with our opponents, we think it expedient to remind them on which side the Fathers depose in the case before us. By these quotations we would prove no more than that the ancients *understood* the washing of regeneration, and indeed used the term *regeneration,* as synonymous with baptism. 

But were we asked for the precise import of the phrase, 'washing or bath  of  regeneration,'  either  on  philological  principles,  or  as explained by the Apostles, we would give it as our judgment, that the  phrase  is  a  circumlocution  or  periphrasis  for  water.  It  is *loutron,*  a  word  which  more  properly  signifies  the  vessel  that contains the water, than the water itself; and is, therefore, by the most learned critics and translators, rendered *bath,* as indicative either of the vessel containing the fluid or of the use made of the fluid in the vessel. It is, therefore, by a metonymy, the water of baptism,  or  the  water  in  which  we  are  regenerated.  Paul  was Hebrew, and spoke in the Hebrew style. We must learn that style before we fully understand the Apostle's style. In other words, we must studiously read the Old Testament before we can accurately understand the New. What more natural for a Jew accustomed to speak of 'the water of purification,' of 'the water of separation,'10 to speak  of  'the  bath  of  regeneration?'  If  the  phrase  'water  of purification'  meant  water  used  for  the  purpose  of  purifying  a person — if 'the water of separation' meant water used for separating a person, what more natural than that 'the bath of regeneration' should mean water used for regenerating a person? 

But  the  New  Testament  itself  confirms  this  exposition  of  the phrase. We find the word *loutron* once more used by the same Apostle, in  the same connection of thought.  In his  letter to  the Ephesians, he affirms that Jesus has sanctified (separated, purified with the water of purification,) the church by a *loutron* of water — 'a 

bath  of  water,  with  the  word' — 'having  cleansed  it  by  a  bath  of water,  with  the  word.'11  This  is  still  more  decisive.  The  king's 

translators, so fully aware that the sense of this passage agrees with Titus  3:5.  have,  in  both  places,  used  the  word  *washing,*  and Macknight the term *bath* as the import of *loutron.* What is called the *washing* or *bath of regeneration,* in the one passage, is, in the other, called 'the washing' or 'bath of water.' What is called '*saved*' in one, is called '*cleansed*' in the other; and what is called '*the renewal of the Holy Spirit*' in the one, is called '*the word*' in the other; because the Holy Spirit consecrates or cleanses through the word. For thus prayed the Messiah, 'Consecrate them through the truth: thy word is the truth.' And again, 'You are clean through the word that I have spoken unto you.' 

To the same effect, Paul, to the Hebrew Christians, says 'Having your hearts sprinkled from a guilty conscience, and your bodies washed with pure water' — the water of purification, the water of regeneration: for the phrase 'pure water' must be understood not of the  quality  of  the  water,  but  metonymically  of  the  effect,  the cleansing, the washing, or the purifying of the person — 'having your bodies, or persons *washed* with pure water,' or water that purifies or cleanses. 

No one, acquainted with Peter's style, will think it strange that Paul represents  persons  as  *saved,  cleansed,*  or  *sanctified*  by  water; seeing  Peter  unequivocally  asserts  that  '*we  are  saved*'  through water, or through baptism, as was Noah and his family through water and faith in God's promise. 'The antitype immersion does also now save us.' 

Finally, our great Prophet, the Messiah, gives to water the same place and power in the work of regeneration. For when speaking of being *born again* — when explaining to Nicodemus *the new birth,* he says, 'Except a man be *born of water* and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." May not we, then, supported by such high authorities, call that water of which a person is born again, the water or bath of regeneration? 

## New Birth

We have already seen that the consummation of the process of generation or creation is in the birth of the creature formed. So it is in the moral generation, or in the great process of regeneration. There is a state of existence from which he that is born passes; and there is a state of existence into which he enters after birth. This is true  of  the  whole  animal  creation,  whether  oviparous  and viviparous. Now the manner of existence, or the mode of life, is wholly changed; and he is, in reference to the former state, dead and to the new state alive. So in moral regeneration. The subject of this great change before his new birth, existed in one state; but after it, he exists in another. He stands in a new relation to God, angels, and men. He is now born of God, and has the privilege of being  a  son  of  God,  and  is  consequently  pardoned,  justified, sanctified, adopted, saved. The state which he left was a state of condemnation, what some call "the state of nature." The state into which  he  enters  is  a  state  of  favor,  in  which  he  enjoys  all  the heavenly  blessings  through  Christ:  therefore,  it  is  called  'the kingdom of heaven.' All this is signified in his death, burial, and resurrection with Christ; or in his being born of water. Hence, the necessity of being buried with Christ in water, that he may be born of water, that he may enjoy the renewal of the Holy Spirit, and be placed under the reign of favor. 

*All  the  means  of  salvation  are  means  of  enjoyment,  not  of procurement.* Birth itself is not for procuring, but for enjoying the life  possessed  before  birth.  So  in  the  analogy — no  one  is  to  be baptized, or to be buried with Christ; no one is to be put under the water of regeneration for the purpose of *procuring* life, but for the purpose of *enjoying* the life of which he is possessed. If the child is never  born,  all  its  sensitive  powers  and  faculties  cannot  be enjoyed; for it is after birth that these are fully developed, and feasted upon all the aliments and objects of sense in nature. Hence all that is *now* promised in the gospel, can only be *enjoyed* by those who are born again and placed in the kingdom of heaven under all its influences. Hence the philosophy of that necessity which Jesus preached — 'Unless  a  man  be  born  again,  he  cannot  discern  the kingdom of heaven' — unless a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into it. 

But let no man think that in the act of being born, either naturally or metaphorically, the child purchases, procures, or merits either life  or  its  enjoyments.  He  is  only  by  his  birth  placed  in circumstances  favorable  to  the  enjoyment  of  life,  and  all  that makes life a blessing. 'To as many as receive him, believing in his name, he grants the privilege of being children of God, who derive their birth not from blood, nor from the desire of the flesh, nor from the will of man, but from God.' 

## Renewing of the Holy Spirit

'He  has  saved  us,'  says  the  Apostle  Paul,  'by  the  bath  of regeneration and the *renewing of the Holy Spirit,* which he poured on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior; that being justified by his favor, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.' Thus, and not by works of righteousness, he has saved us. Consequently, being born of water and the renewing of the Holy Spirit  are  not  works  of  merit  or  of  righteousness,  but  only  the means of enjoyment. But this pouring out of the influences, this renewing  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  is  as  necessary  as  the  bath  of regeneration to the salvation of the soul, and to the enjoyment of the hope of heaven, of which the Apostle speaks. In the kingdom into  which  we  are  born  of  water,  the  Holy  Spirit  is  as  the atmosphere in the kingdom of nature — we mean that the influences of  the  Holy  Spirit  are  as  necessary  to  *the  new  life,*  as  the atmosphere is to our animal life in the kingdom of nature. All that is done in us before regeneration, God our Father effects by *the word,* or the gospel as dictated and confirmed by his Holy Spirit. But after we are thus begotten and born by the Spirit of God — after our new birth — the Holy Spirit is shed on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior; of which the peace of mind, the love, the joy, and the hope of the regenerate is full proof; for these are amongst the fruits of that the Holy Spirit of promise of which we speak. Thus commences (The next chapter)

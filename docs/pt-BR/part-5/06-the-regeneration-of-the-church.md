# 6. The Regeneration of the Church

The word *regeneration* has been used to describe a new state of affairs or the onset of a new condition. In this context, we draw our readers' attention to the need for the regeneration of the church.

I do not refer to the regeneration of any sectarian organization. They are built on a different foundation — one based on decrees from councils, creeds, formularies, or acts of Parliament. Instead, we refer to those communities that explicitly build upon the foundation of Apostles and Prophets, without any human bond of union or code of conduct — our brethren in the reform process of regeneration.

If anyone believes that the current state of affairs we have achieved is the sole, or ultimate goal of our aspirations or efforts, they would be causing us great harm. Indeed, there may be societies among us that have made considerable progress towards the ancient order of things, but we know none that have fully reached that ideal. However, it is encouraging to see so many societies being formed under the banners of reformation, with a commitment to move forward in alignment with the sacred oracles, until they stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

Our opponents struggle to comprehend how any society can be moving towards a better state of affairs than the one they may have started with. Their sectarian policies were established quickly, and the boundaries of their reformation were set just as fast; beyond these boundaries, it became heretical to progress. The founders of new schisms not only saw through a glass darkly, but their view was so limited by human traditions that they aimed only to move a few steps from the hive in which they were born. Soon, a new creed was adopted, and then their development was considered complete. They transitioned from infancy to adulthood in just a few days and deemed anyone who dared to advance further as those who refused to leave the old hive. Consequently, it became as blameworthy to exceed a certain standard as it was to fail to grow at all. This has never been our proposal, and it can never be our objective. We have no new creed to establish, nor any rules of discipline to adopt. We have accepted the Living Oracles as our creed, our measures of faith and practice; and in this regard, we have no additions, alterations, or amendments to suggest. However, in striving to reach this standard of knowledge, faith, and behavior, we still have something ahead of us that we have not yet attained.

To be clear on this subject, we will speak specifically about what is lacking in our individual characters and in our church order, in order to give our meetings the interest and influence that they should exert on our brethren and on society as a whole.

It should be understood that our remarks about what is lacking in the disciples do not apply to every individual but to the general population. First and foremost, there is a lack of more widespread and thorough knowledge of the Holy Scriptures than is held by the vast majority of reformers. There may also be a lack of eagerness or inclination for private devotional reading of the oracles of God, which is essential for growth in the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ — qualities that are the most striking attributes of Christian character. We reason from the proficiency observable among those we know, which is ample enough to provide data for general conclusions.

Reading the Scriptures with the intent to put into practice all that we learn and reading them simply to know what is written are vastly different objectives, resulting in very different outcomes. The influence on our temperament and behavior, in the former case, will soon be evident to everyone around us; while in the latter case, there is no observable improvement. David said that he 'hid the word of God in his heart,' or stored it in his mind, 'that he might not sin against God;' and that he had 'more understanding than all his teachers, because God's testimonies were his meditations.' It is acknowledged that the sacred writings of the Apostles and Evangelists of Jesus Christ should be as precious and delightful to Christians as the ancient oracles were to the most devout Jews. To illustrate what we mean by a private devotional reading and study of the oracles of Christ, we will allow a Jew to share his experience:

'The law of your mouth is more precious to me than thousands of gold and silver. With my whole heart, I have sought you; my soul breaks with longing for your judgments at all times. Your testimonies are my delight and my counselors. Teach me, O Lord, the way of your statutes, and I will keep it to the end. Give me understanding, and I shall keep your law; yes, I will observe it with my whole heart. Lead me in the path of your commandments, for in it, I take delight. Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. At midnight, I will rise to give thanks to you, because of your righteous judgments. Oh, how I love your law; it is my meditation all the day! How sweet are your words to my taste; sweeter than honey to my mouth! Your testimonies I have taken as a heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart. Great peace have they who love your law — nothing shall cause them to stumble.'

These are just a few extracts from one piece, written by a king three thousand years ago. On another occasion, he declared the following praise for God’s testimony:

'The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple: the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. They are more to be desired than gold — yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb. By them your servant is warned, and in keeping of them, there is great reward.'

This fully encapsulates what we mean by a private devotional study of the Holy Scriptures. Every Christian who can read can refresh, strengthen, and comfort their heart daily by reading or committing to memory, and later reflecting on some portion of the book. They may carry the blessed volume in their pocket and often peek into it throughout the day. This practice will help them resist temptation, impart courage to their hearts, provide fluency to their tongues, and imbue their lives with the graces of Christianity.

In this age, when ignorance of the Christian Scriptures is so prevalent, and the obsession with human opinions and traditions is rampant, it is doubly imperative for our brethren to engage much more seriously in studying the book; and then one of them can send a multitude of outsiders fleeing; and, more importantly, they will have communion with God all day and rejoice in His salvation.

Secondly, there is a need among disciples who are heads of families for greater focus and effort in raising their children 'in the correction and instruction of the Lord.' Children of all backgrounds should be taught the oracles of God from the first light of reason. The good seed should be sown in their hearts before the strong seeds of vice can take root. *From a child*, Timothy understood the Holy Scriptures, which were able to make him wise unto salvation through faith in Christ. How many more Timothys might we have, if we had a few more daughters like Lois and mothers like Eunice! Most saints in this generation appear more eager for their children to shine on earth than in heaven — wanting them to be rich here, even at the risk of eternal loss. They work to make their children wealthy and genteel, rather than pure and holy; spending more time shaping them to the foolish and wicked tastes of *refined* society, than teaching them through precept and example the word that is better than gold and more precious than rubies. They thus sow weeds and reap nothing but sorrow. They may end up with a bitter harvest, and years of regret may await them for their neglect and errors. If only a fraction of the time, effort, and expense used to prepare a son or daughter to shine in the middle or upper echelons of *refined* society were spent instilling in them the fear of God and the observance of His commandments, how many more virtuous, solid, and useful citizens — how many more valuable members of the family of God — how many more faithful and capable witnesses for the truth of God would be found throughout the land!

Every Christian family should be a nursery for God. Their offspring should be trained for the skies. The promises of God, the facts recorded in Scripture, and the experiences of Christians assure that every parent who fulfills their duty to their children can expect to see them inherit blessings. Their teaching efforts, supported by their example and constant prayers, will seldom or never fail to impact their descendants positively. The command to raise their children in the Lord implies that this is practical. Both Testaments provide us with ample assurance that such efforts will not be in vain. The notable figures in sacred history were typically the sons of such parents. The sons of God were found among the sons of Seth, while the daughters of men descended from Cain. Abraham was a descendant of Shem; Moses and Aaron were sons of believing parents; Samuel was the child of Hannah, and David was Jesse's son. John the Baptist was the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth; and it pleased the heavenly Father that His Son should be born of a devout virgin.

Under Christ, the faithful are provided with all the necessary means to raise their children for the Lord. The numerous failures we witness can often be attributed to severe neglect or to a fallacious notion that paralyzes all effort; for some think that the salvation or damnation of their children is predetermined for all eternity, independent of their influence: that some are born 'vessels of wrath' while others are 'vessels of mercy;' hence the guidance, examples, and prayers of parents would hold no value. Among such descendants, it will likely happen that some *become* vessels of wrath fit for destruction, while others *become* vessels of mercy, preordained for glory.

When God revealed His laws to Jacob and commanded them to Israel, He instructed that they should 'teach them to their children, so that they might *put their trust in God,* and not be, like their fathers, a rebellious generation.' The Apostles of Christ similarly instructed Christians in the same lesson. This is our guide, not our own reasoning. Let the disciples make this their priority, morning, noon, and night, and we will see the results.

We regret to see this crucial duty, which nature, reason, and revelation all endorse, so neglected by many of our brethren — to find among their children those who are no better acquainted with the Scriptures than the children of their neighbors, who believe in miraculous conversions, or who think it a sin to attempt what they perceive to be solely God's work — never suspecting that God operates through human means and utilizes human agency in His acts of providence and redemption.

I have encountered very few families that make it a daily practice to train their children in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, prompting them each day to commit to memory a portion of the living oracles; yet these few examples lead me to believe and assert that this consistent approach, bolstered by the good example of parents, generally leads to the salvation of their children. Before anyone claims to have found an exception to Solomon's proverb stating, 'Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it,' let them demonstrate that this child was '*trained up in the way he should go.*'

Thirdly, there is a need among disciples for a stricter adherence to relational duties — which includes not just the duties demanded by justice, truth, and moderation; but *all* relational duties. As long as Christians behave like those in the flesh, according to the standards of this world, they will contract debts they cannot promptly settle, make agreements and promises they cannot fulfill, and pledge securities they cannot redeem. All of this is completely incompatible with our profession. Such was not the case with the early disciples. Skeptics of every kind, worldly people, who have read the New Testament, know that such behavior is utterly incompatible with the spirit and letter of Christianity. A Christian's word or promise should be, and indeed is, if Christ is honored, as solemn and binding as any legal contract. And concerning breach of contract or covenant, even when it is greatly or entirely to the Christian's disadvantage, it should not even be considered — 'He changes not, though to his own hurt he covenants.' Much has been lost by the gospel due to the unfaithfulness of its followers! When will it again be said of Christians as a whole, that 'they bind themselves, as with a solemn oath, not to commit any kind of wickedness — to be guilty neither of theft, robbery, nor adultery — *never to break a promise,* or to withhold a deposit when called upon?' Pliny wrote to Emperor Trajan around A.D. 106-7 stating that such was the character of Christians as far as he could ascertain from those who were not Christians. Were all the common (now-a-days rather *uncommon*) virtues of justice, truth, fidelity, and honesty practiced by all Christians, how many mouths would be silenced, and how many novel arguments could be found in favor of Jesus Christ! However, even if these commonplace virtues were as widespread as the Christian profession, there are other nobler virtues of benevolence, goodness, mercy, and sympathy, which belong to this profession, expressed in caring for the sick, the orphan, and the widow — in alleviating the sufferings of our fellow beings. Combine these virtues, or *graces,* as we sometimes call them, with the others, and then how irresistible the argument for the divine authenticity of the gospel becomes! Let industry, frugality, temperance, honesty, justice, truth, fidelity, humility, mercy, and sympathy shine prominently in the lives of the disciples, and the contrast between them and other professing individuals will advocate their cause better than a hundred preachers.

Lastly, there is a need for a more elevated piety to raise the Christian character to the standard of early times. We need not grand speeches or eloquent orations on the excellence of Christian piety and devotion. These are generally acknowledged. But we need to be stirred from our complacency, from our worldly mindset, from our sinful conformity to an apostate generation, towards the demonstration of that holiness in speech and behavior, without which no one will see the Lord. What do the many exhortations from the Apostles to vigilance and prayer imply, if these are not essential to our devotion to God and commitment to His service?

If our hearts are not set on things above, we are unfit for the kingdom of glory. To see the folly of professing Christianity without the power of godliness, we need only to ask how such a person is suited for enjoying God and Christ, whose heart is filled with the worries, anxieties, and concerns of this life — whose entire life revolves around labor and care for the body — a life devoted to transient pleasures? No man can serve both God and Mammon. Where one's treasure is, that is where their heart will be. There is no place for the Spirit of God in a mind consumed by worldly affairs. The spirit of worldly politics and the Spirit of God cannot coexist in the same heart. If Jesus or His Apostles clearly and unequivocally taught any doctrine, it is this: that 'the cares of this world, the desires for other things, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and render it unfruitful.'

If anyone desires to experience the power of godliness, they must dedicate their whole being to it. The responsibilities of this life will be approached religiously, as a duty subordinate to the will of God. While their hands are engaged in tasks necessary for their own sustenance or that of their household, their hearts will dwell above. They will find joy in God and commune with Him all day. A Christian is not someone who is devout only on occasion, or who is religious or devout one day a week or for just one hour each day. It is the overarching direction of their soul — it is the beginning, middle, and end of each day. Ensuring that their calling and election is secure is the focus of their life. Their mind rests only in God. They consistently place the Lord before them. This is their joy and delight. They would not wish for it to be any other way. They would not enjoy eternal life in any other form than that which God Himself has proposed. They embrace God's arrangements not out of necessity, but out of choice. Their religious services are an expression of perfect freedom. They are truly free. The Lord's commandments are not burdensome but joyful. The yoke of Christ is easy to them, and His burden is light. They will sing, with David:

```
The love that to thy laws I bear,
No language can display;
They with fresh wonders entertain
My ravish’d thoughts all day.

The law that from thy mouth proceeds,
Of more esteem I hold,
Than untouch’d stores, than thousand mines
Of silver and of gold.

Whilst in the way of thy commands,
More solid joy I found,
Than had I been with vast increase
Of envied riches crown’d.

Thy testimonies I have kept,
And constantly obey’d;
Because the love I bore to them
Thy service easy made.
```

In the same measure that Christians devoutly study the oracles of God, teach them to their children, practice all relational duties to society, and strive for a higher standard of piety, they will enhance their influence in the grand and heavenly task of regenerating the world.

A few remarks about what is lacking in the organization of Christian assemblies, to ensure their public meetings exert the desired influence on themselves and on society, will conclude this section of our essay.

Our heavenly Father desires our happiness in all His institutions. His ordinances are therefore the most reliable, straightforward, and effective means of promoting our happiness. The Lord Jesus gave Himself for the church to purify and bless it; therefore, within the church reside all the institutions that can foster the individual and collective well-being of the Christian community. When attending these institutions on the Lord's day, much depends on the preparation of heart in everyone uniting to commemorate the death and resurrection of the Son of God.

Concerning the most scriptural and rational manner of observing the Lord's day, for their own comfort and the regeneration of the world, we first note that much depends on the state of mind or preparation of heart with which we approach the gatherings of the saints.

Imagine two people, A and B, members of the same church, taking their places at the Lord's table. A, from the moment he opens his eyes in the morning, is filled with thoughts of the Savior's life, death, and resurrection. In his private quarters, with his family, and throughout the day, he meditates or discusses the wonders of redemption and recalls the teachings and deeds of the Messiah. B, however, wakes up like any other day, feels unbound by any obligations due to the holiness of the time, engages in mundane conversations about everyday matters, and lets his thoughts drift to the events of the past week or consider the tasks of the next. If he meets a neighbor, friend, or brother, they discuss current events, upcoming news, and the agricultural situation, weather patterns, or health trends — topics regarding Europe, Congressional decisions, or political candidates become his topic of discussion. As he travels to church, he continues this conversations about these matters until he enters the church doors. Given that A and B have entered the building with such different states of mind, can it not be assumed that their experiences and enjoyment will differ just as much as their thoughts this morning? Can B, with just one effort, clear his mind, center his thoughts, and in an instant shift his focus from worldly concerns to matters of heaven?

If this is conceivable, then preparation and meditation are entirely unnecessary for the acceptable worship of God and for the meaningful enjoyment of His institutions.

But does it align with experience or reason that B can find delight in God and prosper in commemorating the marvels of redemption while his mind wanders through a myriad of trivialities? — while, like the eyes of a fool, his mind travels to the ends of the earth? Can he echo a pious Jew's sentiment, 'How lovely are Your tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! My soul longs — yes, even faints, for the courts of the Lord! My heart and flesh cry out for the living God. Blessed are those who dwell in Your house; they will keep praising You! A day in Your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than dwell in the tents of wickedness.' — 'One thing I have desired of the Lord, that will I seek, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord and inquire in His temple. O send out Your light and Your truth! Let them lead me; bring me to Your holy hill and to Your tabernacles. Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy; yes, I will praise You, O God, my God!'

Did the Jew possess a higher form of worship, more exalted views of God's salvation, and deeper piety than a Christian? Or were the ordinances of the Jewish sanctuary more engaging and revitalizing than those of the Christian church? This will not be asserted; therefore, B and those with similar mindsets are entirely mistaken when they approach the house of God with the same mindset they would have while visiting the marketplace, the forum, or other common worldly places.

Christians need not claim, in self-defense, that all days are alike, that all places and times are equally holy, and that they should be in the best possible state of mind at all times. Even if we were to concede all their arguments, they would not insist that one should speak to God or enter into the presence of God as they would approach fellow men. They would not state that they should have the same thoughts or feelings when approaching the Lord's table as they would have at a common table; or entering a court of political justice as when coming into the House of God. There is, as Solomon said, a time and a season for every purpose and every work: There is the Lord's day, the Lord's table, the Lord's house, and the Lord's people; and there are thoughts, states of mind, and behaviors that are appropriate and inappropriate for all these occasions. In the public assembly, the entire order of worship should reflect what is occurring in the hearts of all the worshipers. That joy in the Lord, that peace and tranquility of mind, that affection for the brethren, that reverence for the institutions of God's house, which everyone feels, should be evident in all the activities of the day. Nothing that would detract from any of these should ever manifest itself in the congregation of Jesus Christ our Lord. No levity, irreverence, gloom, sadness, pride, unkindness, harshness towards anyone, or coldness should be present, but only love, peace, joy, humility, and reverence should be reflected in every face, word, or action of any disciple.

These matters are not trivial. They exert a significant influence on both brethren and visitors. These visible and tangible displays of the spirit and attitude of Christians are crucial; if Paul considered it necessary to discuss *veils* and *long hair* when advising a church "to do all things decently and in order," we, in this age of decline, may rightfully address details as minute as those before us.

At this moment, we do not intend to delve into the specifics of church order or Christian discipline, nor elaborate on the importance of dedicating a portion of the time to singing, praying, reading, teaching, exhorting, commemorating, and sharing; nor assess how much of this or that is proper. The times and circumstances should determine the allocation of time for these exercises and the most appropriate moments for gatherings and dismissals. It is unnecessary at this time to mention that there should be scriptural order, leadership, appropriate discipline, and accepted subordination to one another in the fear of God. Rather, we now discuss the *manner* in which everything should be conducted, and the things themselves, their necessity or value.

Having pointed out what in some cases seems to be lacking in the manner of gathering on the Lord's day, we will now address the shortcomings evident in many congregations for the aforementioned purposes.

First of all, it should be noted that some churches exhibit a lack of *a proper approach to handling the Scriptures for the edification of the brethren.* It is acknowledged by all the holy brethren that the Scriptures, known as *the living oracles,* are God's primary instrument for all His objectives in the lives of saints on earth. Through these, they are converted to God, comforted, consecrated, made fit for an inheritance among the sanctified, and equipped for every good word and work. Everything hence relies on properly understanding these inspired volumes. Their operation is limited to the extent that they are comprehended.

The system of delivering sermons based on a passage is now almost universally abandoned by those who intend to ensure their listeners understand God's message. Speakers and exhorters may choose a word, phrase, or verse; but those who genuinely nourish the flock of God with knowledge and understanding know that this method is wholly inadequate. Philological lectures on a chapter are only marginally better. Discussing any particular topic, such as faith, repentance, election, or the Christian calling, may sometimes be beneficial; but in a congregation of Christians, the practice of reading and examining various books in a consistent sequence, with every disciple holding the volume in hand, following the narrative connections, examining parallel passages, engaging in mutual questioning, pinpointing the meanings of specific words and phrases through comparisons with the styles of that writer or speaker, or those of others; interspersing these exercises with prayer and praise, and keeping the narrative, epistle, or address continually before the minds of all, is essential for the youngest disciple in the congregation to grasp and develop a genuine interest in it. This approach will yield more in a single year than is accomplished in many popular meetings today.

Significant attention should be given to references in any writing, relating to the unique aspects of time, place, and circumstance, as well as the geographical, historical, and chronological specifics of all factual matters pertaining to all notable figures within the narratives: for these often serve as the best interpreters of style, and provide clarity for the meaning of the written word.

This thorough, probing, comparing, and contemplating of the Holy Scriptures in private, in family settings, and in congregations cannot fail to enhance our knowledge of God and humanity. The Bible holds more genuine wisdom than all the books authored by men. It enlightens us in our natural, moral, political, and religious relationships. Although it does not teach us astronomy, medicine, chemistry, or mathematics, it imparts all the knowledge that elevates and dignifies our moral nature and prepares us for happiness. Blessed is the individual who meditates upon it day and night! They will grow and thrive in moral health and vigor, akin to trees flourishing by water sources. Their leaves will never wither — their fruits will never cease.

Congregations of saints require a structured approach to deepening understanding of this book. Merely reading large sections in a disjointed manner produces some benefit; for there is light, majesty, and life in all of God's oracles; no one can listen to them without gaining from it. However, the benefit derived from such readings is a mere fraction of what could be obtained through systematic reading and examination. The congregation serves as the school of Christ, and every pupil should feel that they learn something valuable every time they sit at the feet of their Master. They must take the Master's book with them, and like any earnest and organized pupil, they must open it and study it, using all the resources that their brethren and fellow learners can provide for a more comprehensive understanding of all its valuable teachings.

A Christian teacher, well-versed in its contents, or a group of such individuals who can draw from their intellectual wealth new and old concepts, will significantly advance the students in this heavenly discipline; but in their absence, the students must become self-taught; and self-taught scholars are generally the best educated: for they can only progress if they study diligently and carefully learn the fundamentals of each subject.

To illustrate the diligence and attention to detail required for proficiency in understanding the New Testament, let us consider a lesson assigned to the disciples one day focused on the Nativity of the Messiah. The second chapter of Matthew is read. After reading this chapter, or the entire first section of Matthew's account, the elder or president of the day asks some brother, a capable reader, to read what the other evangelists have reported on this topic. Since Mark and John are silent on the nativity, he reads Luke 2, from verses 1 to 41. Following this reading, the following questions arise for discussion, and most are posed to the brethren for resolution:

1. Who was Caesar Augustus, and over what people did he reign?  
2. When was the edict of enrollment issued, or when did the first census take place?  
3. What territories were included in Syria, and what were its borders?  
4. Who was in charge of Syria during the first census?  
5. Who ruled in Judea at that time?  
6. What were the boundaries of Judea, and where was it located within the Holy Land?  
7. In what region was Jerusalem situated, and by what other names was it known?  
8. What was the birthplace of Joseph?  
9. Where was Nazareth located, and in which district?  
10. What were the borders of Galilee, and what were its major towns?  
11. In what district was Bethlehem, and how far was it from Jerusalem?  
12. Who were the Magi?  
13. Why were 'Herod and all Jerusalem alarmed' when the Magi reported the Star in the East?  
14. Who were the scribes and chief priests convened by Herod, and why were they gathered?  
15. How did they decide on the questions posed to them?  
16. What prophet did they reference, and where can the quotation be found?  
17. What was the lineage of Joseph and Mary?  
18. How did the Magi find the house where the Messiah was born?  
19. Why did the Magi not return to Herod?  
20. Who came first to pay respects to the Messiah — the shepherds of Bethlehem or the eastern Magi?  
21. In which part of the world is Egypt located?  
22. How far is it from Bethlehem?  
23. How long was the Messiah in Egypt?  
24. Who prophesied His return from Egypt, and where is this found?  
25. Who predicted the slaughter of male infants in Bethlehem, and what prompted Herod to commit this cruel act?  
26. Who followed Herod on the throne of Judea?  
27. Why did Joseph return to Nazareth?  
28. Which prophet foretold this event, and where is it stated?

Once these matters are clarified, utilizing maps, geographical and chronological indexes, and the appendix of the Family Testament, several moral reflections will naturally emerge; for in these incidents are evident the wisdom, care, and providence of our heavenly Father, His faithfulness, His humility, and love; the great variety of His instruments and agents; the ease with which He thwarts the wicked designs and schemes of adversaries; the infallibility of His foreknowledge; the complete agency of individuals, both good and bad; and the profound humility of His only Son in all the circumstances surrounding His birth. Infallible arguments regarding His claims can be drawn from these ancient prophecies, notable for their precision in time, location, and context; many eloquent and powerful lessons on human pride, vanity, and arrogance can be discerned from the birthplace, cradle, and familial ties of the Heir of the Universe; and many other poignant appeals to the heart, arising from the birth, circumcision, and dedication of the Messiah, along with all events in Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and the Temple linked to His first appearance on earth, will present themselves to the brotherhood of Christ with lasting freshness and beauty.

A subtle hint is often sufficient for the wise. Should this method be pursued for only two hours every Lord's day, with every disciple committed to the task; and should the results then be compared with what emerges from the scrap Doctors or sermonizers addressing inattentive and dreaming audiences, no one, maintaining even a modicum of sense, would favor the popular system.

A reform in the way the living oracles are handled is greatly needed; the sooner and more broadly it is adopted, the greater the regenerative impact the brotherhood will have on the world. Enlightened by the Holy Scriptures and adorned with the armor of light, each disciple will advance like David against the Philistines — a force against the armies of outsiders. Even better, holding the words of divine favor within their hearts, they will carry with them into every social setting a fragrance akin to the rose of Sharon — a sweetness that resembles a garden blessed by the Lord.

Some congregations also seem to lack proper attention to discipline and regard for decorum in managing cases that arise. In any family or congregation, there are instances requiring discipline. Offenses, transgressions, and apostasy did occur in the congregations overseen by the apostles or those in charge, and they will happen again in this state of discipline and trial in which we all currently reside. Such occurrences should be anticipated; and every congregation ought to be ready to act upon the emergency with wisdom and decorum. Significant harm has been done to church progress due to neglect of such cases, both in the attention given to them and in how they have been resolved once addressed.

Nothing is more absurd and offensive to the principles of good order and decorum than dragging every offender and offense into the public assembly right away. Those responsible for a congregation, the elders whose experience has imparted them with prudence, ought to be the first to know of such happenings; they should then present the matter to the congregation. No novice should feel entitled to disrupt the congregation by voicing, at their own discretion, a complaint against a brother, be the matter public or private.

However, we are currently discussing the *manner* of proceeding in such instances. An utmost tenderness for everyone's feelings, keen empathy for the offender, unwavering firmness in applying the corrections as prescribed by the Head of the church, and a prompt response in accordance with the prescribed laws in the cases at hand are all critical considerations.

No passion, no favoritism, no ill feelings — only love and piety, alongside faithfulness and truth; and nothing but courteousness and kindness should ever be present in God's house. When any individual is found guilty and separated from the community, it should be done with all seriousness and in prayer, hoping that the institution of Christ becomes a blessing to the transgressor.

Nonetheless, wrongdoers or those who do not conduct themselves honorably in accordance with Christ's commandments should not be tolerated among God's professed family. Such individuals are a burden to the entire community — they are blemishes at every love feast, and stains on the larger profession. One sinner destroys a great deal of good; yet separation, or excision, akin to amputation, should only occur in the most extreme cases after all other remedies — such as correction, warning, negotiation, and pleading — have proven ineffective. To avert festering or harm to the entire body, amputation is required; it is a necessary remedy. More strictness, more firmness, and more compassion in such cases would greatly enhance the moral influence of every society. A few individuals walking together in the bonds of Christian love, under Christ's discipline, is preferable to the largest gathering where there visibly and unmistakably exist many who do not fear God and do not uphold His commandments.

In God's house, there should be purity, reverence, meekness, brotherly kindness, and love. Trust in the honesty and sincerity of our brethren is vital to fostering communion. Feeling united with those determined for eternal life and resolved to prioritize the kingdom of heaven and its required righteousness is immensely uplifting, comforting, and exciting. However, to be uncertain if we are merging with a collective of ignorance, corruption, and apathy is a corruption of the spirit; love grows cold, and then we have only the appearance of godliness without its true power.

For the church to have a regenerative influence on society at large, a more pronounced display of Christian philanthropy is required in all its public gatherings; care for the poor should be reflected in the generosity of its offerings; expressing sincere compassion for the suffering among all people, not just fellow believers; and a fervent zeal for the conversion of sinners should be proportional to its professed understanding of the value of its own salvation, as well as its resources and means for enlightening the world on the matters unseen and eternal. Demonstrating these traits is the most effective way to spread the gospel and achieve new victories among our fellow citizens. The spiritual health and vitality of any church should be measured more by its effectiveness and success in bringing sinners to God than by all its other accomplishments combined. For too long, it has been maintained that it is the nearly exclusive responsibility of the preacher to convert the world. He must expend his time and wear himself out through travels and preaching, while individual church members focus solely on their own lives, seeking personal wealth and domestic comfort. He must endure the elements, forsake his wife and family, and trust others with his affairs, while they merely observe and pray for his success. Such a perspective is perplexing! Has he received a divine commission — been singled out for combat — while they remain behind to manage their homes and children? Some may believe this — some may assume it is solely his duty to devote his time and talents to this work, while theirs is merely to labor for their own benefit; but surely, such are not the views and sentiments of our brethren!

The work of the Lord will never advance — in other words, the regenerative influence of the church will not amount to much, if it is taken to be the duty of only a few, or just one or two individuals deemed preachers, to labor for the Lord.

There is either a specific call, a general call, or no call at all to engage in the conversion of the world. If a few are specially called, the others can focus solely on their own issues; 'to seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.' If no one is called, then it is the duty of no one, and the Lord has nothing for His people to do — no world to convert; or, at the least, nothing for them to contribute to this work. None of us are prepared for the implications of any of these assumptions. It follows, therefore, that it is the duty of all to labor according to their abilities in this work. All are called to work for the Lord. I maintain that every citizen in Christ's kingdom is required to take up arms for the King, just as I am; and if they cannot partake in the fight for the Lord's battles, then they must care for the wives and children of those who can and will fight for their King and country. The burden of the war must be borne by the subjects of the crown; and as the Lord will not appoint any tax collectors in His kingdom, but instead accepts only voluntary contributions, He keeps a record against those who do nothing, and will settle accounts with them upon His return. He labels even the contributions made for the gospel by those remaining at home as 'a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.'

Yet we hesitate to engage in such actions, fearing we might resemble those we believe have acted imprudently. It is truly strange that once something has been misused, it is never to be employed again! Yet I have unwittingly digressed from my purpose. The manner in which the brethren labor for the salvation of the world encompasses all that falls within our defined boundaries. Enough has been said on this topic. Let the brethren solemnly reflect on what is required to give their meetings the influence they ought to wield over themselves and over society at large.

We are capable of receiving moral and spiritual benefits from maintaining our own decorum and order in the congregation, as well as from those attending our gatherings as onlookers. In this regard, as with all forms of doing good, he who refreshes others is also refreshed in return; for he who blesses others is invariably blessed through doing so. None experience the blessings of the gospel more fully than those who are most actively involved in blessing others. What joyous occasions they are when many turn to the Lord! If we wish to sustain an ongoing celebration, we must consistently commit ourselves to promoting the happiness of others. We must live for God, just as we live to God.

In detailing these outlines, other details may emerge that are even more minute, yet perhaps equally important, calling for the brethren's focus. We cannot address these matters too soon. The time has come again, when judgment must begin at the house of God. Those who have long enjoyed the word of life and the Christian institutions must soon give an account. They will answer for their stewardship because the Lord has promised to call them to a judgment. An era is imminent, which will be referred to as *the Regeneration* for a thousand years to come. The Lord Jesus will judge that adulterous generation and condemn those who have broken the covenant and allied with the governments of the earth to the fires of judgment. Presently, the cry resounds in our land, 'Come out of her, my people, that you do not partake of her sins, and that you do not receive of her plagues.' The Lord Jesus will soon rebuild Jerusalem and restore the tabernacle of David, which has long been in ruins. Let the church prepare itself for the return of her Lord and ensure she is ready for His appearance.

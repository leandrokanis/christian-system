# 5. The Use of the Theory of Regeneration

One might imagine, from the extensive arguments, debates, and sermons regarding the theory of regeneration, that a solid theory is essential to salvation: that it must be preached in every sermon in order to regenerate the listeners. Nothing could be more ridiculous. Who can believe that any theory of the resurrection or regeneration of the body can affect the body in the grave? Just as little can any theory affect those who are unregenerate, or those who are dead in trespasses and sins. A sermon on generation, or on natural birth, would be as effective for those unborn in bringing them into this life, as a sermon on moral or physical regeneration would be. This explains the fact that in all the accounts of apostolic preaching to Jew and Gentile — in all the excerpts of their sermons and speeches found in the New Testament — the topic of regeneration is not mentioned even once. It is proposed only once in all the historical books of the New Testament, and only during a private discussion with a Jewish senator about the matters of Christ's kingdom. No theory understood or believed by the unregenerate, and no theory presented to them for their acceptance, can make any difference to their regeneration. We might as well present a theory of digestion to someone with indigestion to cure their stomach — or a theory of vegetation to a cutting to hasten its growth — as to preach any perspective on regeneration to a sinner in hopes of making them a Christian.

What, then, is the purpose of the previous remarks on this subject? I will first honestly inform the reader that they were not written for his regeneration, either of mind or body; but for the benefit of those who are engaged in the work of regenerating others, and to convince such Christians as may have come to believe that we aim at nothing but the mere immersion of individuals as solely necessary for the entire process of conversion or regeneration, as they understand the terms. The purpose of this theory, if it has any, is to serve as a guide to those who are laboring publicly or privately for the regeneration of sinners. If we have assigned a proper place to facts, testimony, faith, feeling, action, the bath of regeneration, the renewing of the Holy Spirit, and a new life, the path is clearly laid out. They are to present the important facts and declare the entire testimony of God to sinners, in order to facilitate their conversion or regeneration. Like Paul, in his account of his efforts in Corinth, they must go forth, not in the strength of human philosophy, '*but declaring the testimony of God,*' and laying before their listeners 'the wonderful works of God.'

This is the purpose, and the only proper purpose of sound theory on any subject. It is to guide the practitioner, not the subject being acted upon. I would hope, under Divine blessing, to be the means of regenerating more individuals in a single year, without ever mentioning regeneration or speculating on the subject, by stating and emphasizing the testimony of God, than by preaching every day the most recognized theory of regeneration ever endorsed by any council on earth. With these thoughts in mind, we have offered the preceding remarks; and shall now briefly turn our attention to (the next chapter).

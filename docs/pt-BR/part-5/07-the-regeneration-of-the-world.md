# 7. The Regeneration of the World

All the kingdoms of this world shall soon become the kingdoms of our Lord the King. He will throw down all the current rulers from their thrones. He will grind to dust the despotisms, both civil and ecclesiastical; and with the breath of His mouth, cast them to the four winds of heaven. The anti-Christian power, whether it is called Papal, Muslim, Pagan, or Atheistic, will be certainly destroyed, just as surely as Jesus reigns in heaven. No trace of them will remain. The best government on earth, whether it is English or American, contains within it the seeds of its own destruction — carries in its constitution a millstone, which will sink it to the depths of the sea. They do not acknowledge that God has set His Christ upon His throne. They will not kiss the Son. Society under their governance is not blessed. The land mourns because of the wickedness of those who sit in high places. Ignorance, poverty, and crime abound, due to the injustices and iniquities of those who guide the destinies of nations. Men who do not fear God, do not love His Son, and do not heed the principles of His governance, yet wield the sword and hold the scepter in all lands.

This is completely contrary to the peace and happiness of the world. Therefore, He will break them into pieces like a potter's vessel, and establish an order of society in which justice, inflexible justice, shall hold absolute dominion. Jesus will be universally acknowledged by all of humanity, and all nations shall honor Him. This state of society will be the fulfillment of the Christian faith, in all its moral influences and tendencies toward mankind.

How far this change will be accomplished through moral means, and how far through physical means, is not the subject of our present inquiry. However, the preparation of a people for the coming of the Lord must result from the restoration of the ancient gospel and order of things. And whenever it may come, the day of the regeneration of the world will be as wonderful and terrible as the day of the deluge, Sodom's judgment, or Jerusalem's catastrophe. Who will stand when the Lord does this?

But all the regenerations, whether physical or moral, individual, congregational, or national, are but types and shadows, or means of preparation for the —

## Regeneration of the Heavens and the Earth

The Bible begins with the creation of the heavens and the earth; but the Christian revelation ends with the regeneration, or new creation, of the heavens and the earth. This is the ancient promise of God, confirmed to us by the Christian apostles. The present elements are to be transformed by fire. The old or antediluvian earth was purified by water; but the current earth is reserved for fire, along with all the works of man that are upon it. It shall be turned into a lake of liquid fire. However, those who have died in Christ will have been regenerated in body before the old earth is transformed by fire. The bodies of the saints will be as compatible with the new earth and heavens as their present bodies are with the current heavens and earth. God recreates, regenerates, but annihilates nothing; thus, the present earth will not be annihilated. The best description we can give of this regeneration is in the words of one who had a vision of it on the island of Patmos. He describes it as it relates to the New Jerusalem, which is to stand upon the new earth, under the canopy of the new heaven: —

'And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away; and the sea was no more. And I, John, saw the holy city, the New Jerusalem, descending from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be among them — their God. And He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more, nor grief, nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things have passed away.'

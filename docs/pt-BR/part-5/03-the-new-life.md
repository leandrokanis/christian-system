# 3. The New Life

'*Newness of life*' is a Hebraism for a *new life*. The new birth brings us into a new state. 'Old things have passed away; all things have become new,' says an Apostle: 'for if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.' A new spirit, a new heart, and an outward character that reflects this change are the effects of the regenerating process: 'for the end of the change,' the grand results of the remedial system, is 'love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith.' 'Love is the fulfillment of the whole law,' and the fruit of the whole gospel. It is the essential principle of all Christian behavior, the essence of the new man, the breath of the new life. Faith operates according to this principle. It is a working principle, and love is the rule by which it operates. The Spirit of God is the spirit of love and the foundation of a sound mind. Every heartbeat of the new heart is driven by the impulse of the spirit of love. Hence, the brotherhood is cherished, and all humanity is embraced in boundless goodwill. When the tongue speaks and the hands and feet move and operate under the unrestricted guidance of this principle, we see the Christian character brought to life. For meekness, humility, mercy, sympathy, and active benevolence are merely names for the various workings of this all-renovating, invigorating, sanctifying, and uplifting principle. 'He who dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him.'

The Christian, or the new man, is thus a philanthropist to the fullest extent of the meaning of that word. Truth and love have set him free from all the tyrannies of passion, guilt, fear, and shame; they have filled him with courage, both active and passive. Therefore, his main endeavor, to which all others contribute, is to participate with our Savior in the salvation of the world. 'If by any means I may save some,' are not just the words of Paul but of every *new man*. Are they merchants, mechanics, farmers? — are they magistrates, lawyers, judges, or ordinary citizens? — are they masters, servants, fathers, sons, brothers, neighbors? — whatever or wherever they may be, they live for God and His city, for the King and His kingdom. They do not associate with the children of wrath — the miser, the selfish, the wasteful, the frivolous, the proud, the slanderer, the gossip, the rake, the libertine, the drunkard, the thief, the murderer. Every new man has left these realms; has severed ties with Satan and his followers, and has joined the family of God. These he loves sincerely — those he pities — and he does good to all.

The character of the new man is an elevated one. Recognizing himself as a son and heir of God, he cultivates the temperament, spirit, and behavior that correspond with such an exalted relationship. He despises everything mean, petty, earthly, sensual, and devilish. Just as the only begotten and beloved Son of God serves as the model for his future personal glory, the character that Jesus exhibited among men is the ideal for his daily imitation. His everyday aspiration is —  

- Thy fair example will I trace, 

To teach me what I ought to be; Make me by thy transforming grace, Lord Jesus, daily more like thee." 

The law of God is hidden in his heart. The living oracles dwell in his mind; and he grows in favor with God as he grows in the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ his Lord. Like a newborn babe, he longs for the pure milk of the word of God, so that he may grow by it; for just as the thirsty deer longs for the streams of water, so his soul longs for God. Thus, he lives for God, and walks with Him. This is the character of the regenerate — of him who is born of God — of the new man in Christ Jesus. This is the transformation of heart, life, and character, which is the tendency and the fruit of the process of regeneration, as taught and exemplified by the Apostles and those commended by God in their writings.

We now proceed to offer a few remarks on physical regeneration, the second part of our subject.

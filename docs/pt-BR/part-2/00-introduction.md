# Introduction

'I pray — for those who will believe in me through their teaching, *that all may be one*; that as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, *they also may be in us, so that the world may believe* that you have sent me, and that you gave me the glory, which I have given them, so that *they may be one,* as we are one; I in them, and you in me, *that their union may be perfected*: and that *the world may know* that you have sent me, and that you love them as you love me.' Thus, the Messiah prayed; and it is appropriate for him to pray this way, as he was wise enough to teach that, 'If a kingdom is divided by factions, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a family is divided by factions, that family cannot stand. Through civil strife, any kingdom can be devastated; and no city or family, where such strife exists, can endure.'

If this is true — and it is; if Jesus is the Messiah — then in what moral desolation does the kingdom of Jesus Christ exist! Was there ever a time, or is there now, in all the earth, a kingdom more torn by internal strife and dissension than what is commonly called the church of Jesus Christ! Should anyone think it acceptable to paganize both the Greek and Latin churches — to remove one hundred million members from the visible and invisible boundaries of the Christian family or kingdom of Jesus Christ; and consider the Protestant faith and people as the only true faith and the only true citizens of the kingdom of Jesus; — what then shall we say of them, viewed as the visible kingdom, over which Jesus presides as Prophet, Priest, and King! Of forty million Protestants, shall we constitute the visible kingdom of the Prince of Peace? So be it, for the sake of argument; and then what? The Christian army is forty million strong. But how do they gather? Under forty banners? — Under forty opposing leaders? Would to God there were only forty! In the Geneva group alone, there are almost that many petty chiefs. My soul sickens at the details!

Take the English branch of the Protestant faith — I mean England and the United States and all the islands where the English Bible is read; how many conflicts, dissensions, and anathemas can we tally? I will not attempt to name the opposing creeds, feuds, and factions that are in perpetual conflict under the banners of the Prince of Peace. Yet they speak of love and charity, and of converting the Jews, the Turks, and Pagans!!!

Shall we turn away from this picture, lay down our pen, and languish in despair? No! For Jesus has said, 'Blessed are *the peacemakers,* for they shall be called *Sons of God.*' But who can make peace when all elements are at war? Who is so enthusiastic as to think that he can stem the tide of strife or extinguish the fury of sectarian flames! But the page of universal history whispers in our ears, If you wait until all the warring factions lay down their arms and make one spontaneous and simultaneous effort to unite; you will be as great a fool as the man who sat by the Euphrates, waiting until all its waters run into the sea.

We are so optimistic — perhaps many will say, so visionary, as to believe that a *nucleus* has formed, or may form, around which all the children of God may one day gather. No one, in any case, can claim that thinking about the current state of Christ's kingdom is either impious or immoral — that it is inhumane or unchristian to ponder the possibility or practicality of any plan to gather together the children of God under the banner of the Cross alone. No one can claim that such an endeavor is absolutely fanciful, unless they deny the truth of the Messiah's statement and declare that the current wars and conflicts must extend and multiply throughout all time and that God will convert the whole world, *without answering the prayer of his Son*; or rather, on a plan contrary to that which he announced, and in spite of all the moral desolations that have followed from the conflicts and battles of five hundred sects over fifteen hundred years!

Does anyone dare to say, or even think in an uncharitable or malevolent way, to make an effort to rally the fragmented armies of Zion's King and attempt to persuade them to turn their arms from one another against the common enemy? With such a one, it would be worse than futile to reason or exchange a single argument. Should we not rather regard it as the most honorable, acceptable, and commendable endeavor that can be undertaken by mortal man on this earthly stage? And just as God has achieved the most remarkable revolutions through the humblest agents, using means that seem the most unlikely according to human wisdom; we think it fitting and appropriate to put forth an effort and extend our hands to the work of peace and love.

From the Messiah's intercession quoted above, it is undeniable that unity is strength, and disunity is weakness; that there is a plan founded in infinite wisdom and love, by which, and which alone, the world may both *believe* and *know* that God has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. And like all the plans of Heaven, it is simply admirable. No mortal need assume that they shall have the honor of devising either the plan to unite Christians in one holy band of zealous cooperation or to convert Jews and Gentiles to the faith that Jesus is that *seed,* through whom all the families of the earth are yet to be blessed. The plan is divine. It is ordained by God; and, better still, it is already revealed. Is anyone impatient to hear it? Let them read the intercessions of the Lord Messiah again, which we have chosen as our motto. Let them then examine the two following propositions and say whether these do not express Heaven's own scheme for increasing and converting the body of Christ.

**First.** Nothing is essential to the conversion of the world except the unity and cooperation of Christians.

**Second.** Nothing is essential to the unity of Christians except the Apostles' teaching or testimony.

Or does one prefer to express the plan of the Self-Existent in different words? Then they may change the order and say,

**First.** The testimony of the Apostles is the only and all-sufficient means of uniting all Christians.

**Second.** The union of Christians with the Apostles' testimony is sufficient, and alone sufficient, for the conversion of the world. Neither truth alone nor unity alone is sufficient to subdue the unbelieving nations; but truth and unity combined are omnipotent. They are *omnipotent,* for God is in them and with them and has consecrated and blessed them for this very purpose.

These two propositions have been stated, illustrated, developed, — and shall I say proved, in the *Christian Baptist* and *Millennial Harbinger,* to the conviction of thousands. Indeed, one of them is as universally accepted as it has been proposed, viz: *That the union of Christians is essential* *to the conversion of the world*; and though, perhaps, some might be found questioning whether, if all Christians were united, the whole world could be converted to God; there is no person we have heard of who acknowledges a general or universal prevalence of the gospel — in what is typically called the millennial age of the world — and who asserts that moral means will play any role in its introduction, who does not also acknowledge that the unity of Christians is essential to that state of affairs. Indeed, to suppose that all Christians will form one communion in that joyful age of the world, and not before it, is to imagine a moral effect without a cause.

The second proposition, viz. — *That the word or testimony of the Apostles is itself all-sufficient, and alone sufficient, for the unity of all Christians,* cannot be rationally doubted by anyone familiar with that testimony or who accepts the authority of their inspiration to make them infallible teachers of the Christian institution. And indeed, all who contend for those human institutions called creeds, argue for them as necessary only to the existence of a party, or while the present schisms, contentions, and dissensions exist. Therefore, all defenses of creeds, ancient and modern, while asserting that the Bible alone is the only perfect and infallible rule of faith and morals; concede that these symbols called creeds are imperfect and fallible, — and also, that these creeds can never achieve what the Bible, without them, can accomplish.

But how to manage without them seems to be an insurmountable difficulty for many well-meaning Christians. To dwell on this point would be outside our current purpose; especially as it has already been fully discussed in the ongoing controversy.

It is perhaps sufficient at this moment to pose the question, How has what is referred to as the church dealt with them? Have they not been the fruitful cause or occasion of all the discord, schisms, and factions currently seen in Christendom? And will not a very superficial observation and a little experience convince everyone that the rivers tend not more certainly to the sea than creeds and human doctrines in religion tend to discord and divisions? For example, take two of the most popular creeds of the present day — the Westminster and that of the Methodist — with whose history American society is more familiar than with any other, and examine the fruit of their influence, — judge their impact by their practical effects on society. To say nothing of the lesser schisms within the party that once formed one communion on the basis of the Westminster creed, we can now enumerate no less than nine separate communions—all professing the Westminster articles, in substance or in form. These include the General Assembly in Scotland and the United States, the Cameronians or Solemn League and Covenant Presbyterians, the Burghers or Unionists, the Anti-Burghers or Seceders, the Relief Presbyterians, the Cumberland Presbyterians, and the New School, which is on the verge of being born. To these might be added those known as English Presbyterians, who are now more generally recognized by the names Independents and Congregationalists; and indeed, the Glassites or Sandemanians, who emerged from the synod of Angus and Mearns in the year 1728. Thus, in one hundred and ninety years, nine or ten distinct communions have emerged from the Westminster creed. Some of them, too, are as discordant and distant from one another as the Jews and Samaritans.

Nor have the Methodists in England, Canada, and the United States fared much better. They now form five or six separate communions, under different names. Not to mention the Whitefieldite Methodists, those of John Wesley include the Wesleyan Methodists, the New Connection of Methodists, the Methodist Episcopal church, the O'Kelly Methodists, the Radicals, etc.

And what shall I say of the twelve or fourteen sects of Baptists — many of whom have as much affection for the Greek and Roman church as they do for one another! It would be futile to provide further evidence that human opinions, inferential reasonings, and deductions from the Bible, expressed in the form of creeds, can never unite Christians, as all their fruits are alienation, repulsion, bickering, and schism. *No human creed in Protestant Christendom can be found that has not caused a division during every generation of its existence.* And I may add — the more thoughtful, inquisitive, and intelligent the community that adheres to a creed, the more frequent their debates and schisms.

But the Bible will fare no better if men approach it with a set of opinions or a human symbol in their minds. For then it is not the Bible but the opinions in the mind that form the bond of unity. Men would indeed be better off with a *written* than an *unwritten* standard of orthodoxy, if they refuse to discard speculation and abstract notions as any part of Christian faith or duty.

Yet all these methods of faith and worship are based on a misunderstanding of the true character of Revelation, which it has long been our effort to correct. For us, Revelation has nothing to do with opinions or abstract reasonings; it is founded wholly and entirely on *facts.* There is not one abstract opinion, not one speculative view asserted or communicated in the Old Testament or the New. Moses begins with asserting facts that have transpired in creation and providence; and John ends with asserting prophetic or prospective facts, in the future displays of providence and redemption. Facts, then, are the *alpha* and the *omega* of both Jewish and Christian revelations.

But so that the reader may have before them a comprehensive view of the whole scheme of unity and cooperation, which the Living Oracles and the present state of Christian religion in the world demand; which has been illustrated and supported at different times and in various manners in the present controversy against divisions, — we shall here summarize it in one sentence.

*Let* **the bible** *be substituted for all human creeds*; **facts**, *for definitions*, **things**, *for words*; **faith**, *for speculation*; **unity of faith**, *for unity of opinion*; **the positive commandments of God**, *for human legislation and tradition*; **piety**, *for ceremony*; **morality**, *for partisan zeal*; **the practice of religion**, *for mere profession; — and the work is done.*

For the illustration of the leading terms, and their correlates found in this *project,* and for a full development of our meaning, (as we may or may not be understood, if interpreted by the polemic vocabulary of this age,) — we shall introduce some extracts from the *Christian Baptist* and *Millennial Harbinger,* developing our meaning and containing some of the key positions that have been fully articulated and debated in a controversy lasting twelve years.

# 6. Purity of Speech

If I were to classify the entire Christian institution into *three* chapters, in the manner of modern schools for the sake of clarity, I would designate them as Christian *faith*, Christian *worship*, and Christian *morality*. The moderns have added two more chapters, which I would refer to as human *philosophy* and human *traditions*. Now, in the first chapter, we, alongside all Christians, are in agreement: Christian faith pertains to *the matters of fact* recorded — to the direct testimony of God found in the New Testament regarding Himself, His Son, and Spirit, as well as concerning humanity — what He has done and what He will do; there is no debate on this. I find that all *confessions of* **faith**, as properly understood, like the *four* gospels, tell the same story concerning matters of fact or faith.

In the second chapter, we also concur that God is to be worshipped through the Mediator — in prayer, in praise, both public and private — through the ordinances of Christian baptism, the Lord's Day, the Lord's Supper, and in the devotional study of His word and of His works of creation and providence.

In the third chapter, we all acknowledge the same moral code. What constitutes morality is recognized and accepted by all; however, in practice, there are significant deviations.

We reject the two remaining chapters as having any relevance to our faith, worship, or morality, as we believe we have discovered that all divisions within Protestant Christendom — all partyism, vain jangling, and heresies that have discredited the Christian profession, stem from human philosophy and human tradition. It is not faith, piety, or morality that has alienated and estranged Christians, but rather philosophy and tradition that have hindered the conversion of the world. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle do not deserve their reputation as philosophers if Calvin, Arminius, and Wesley do not deserve it as well. The former philosophized morally on nature and ancient tradition — the latter focused on the Bible and human society.

Religious philosophers studying the Bible have developed the following doctrines and philosophical distinctions: —

'The Holy Trinity,' 'Three persons of one substance, power, and eternity,' 'Co-essential, co-substantial, co-equal,' 'The Son eternally begotten of the Father,' 'An eternal Son,' 'Humanity and divinity of Christ,' 'The Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son,' 'God's eternal decrees,' 'Conditional and unconditional election and reprobation,' 'God outside of Christ,' 'Free will,' 'Liberty and necessity,' 'Original sin,' 'Total depravity,' 'Covenant of grace,' 'Effectual calling,' 'Free grace,' 'Sovereign grace,' 'General and particular atonement,' 'Satisfy divine justice,' 'Common and special operations of the Holy Ghost,' 'Imputed righteousness,' 'Inherent righteousness,' 'Progressive sanctification,' 'Justifying and saving faith,' 'Historic and temporary faith,' 'The direct and reflex acts of faith,' 'The faith of assurance and the assurance of faith,' 'Legal repentance,' 'Evangelical repentance,' 'Perseverance of the saints,' 'Falling from grace,' 'Visible and invisible church,' 'Infant membership,' 'Sacraments,' 'Eucharist,' 'Consubstantiation,' 'Church government,' 'The power of the keys,' etc. etc.

Regarding these and all similar doctrines, along with all the speculations and terminology they have spawned, we have the privilege neither to affirm nor deny — neither to believe nor doubt; because God has not proposed them to us in His word, and there is no command to believe them. If they are derived from the Scriptures, we find them in the facts and declarations of God's Spirit; if they are not derived from the Bible, we are free from all the difficulties and conflicts they have generated.

*We choose to speak of biblical matters using biblical words,* for we are always wary that if a word is not in the Bible, the idea it represents may not be there either; and we are confident that the truths taught by God are better expressed in the terms and names chosen and assigned by the Holy Spirit than in the words introduced by human wisdom.

There is nothing more essential to the unity of Christ's disciples than *purity* of speech. As long as the earth shared one language, the human family was united. If they had possessed a pure language as well as a single language, they would not have been scattered. God, in His righteous anger, dispersed them; and before He scattered them, *He divided their language*. One of His prophets, who lived in a degenerate age and prophesied against the corruptions of his time, when he spoke of better days—an era of unity and communion—was commanded to proclaim in the name of the Lord, 'Then will I turn to the people a *pure language,* that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve Him *with one consent.*' Purity of speech is here declared as a prerequisite for serving the Lord with one consent.

'The words of the Lord are pure words.' To have a pure speech, we must choose the language of Canaan and abandon that of Ashdod. If we are to be of one mind, we must 'speak the same thing.' This was Paul's vision for unity, and no one can propose a better plan.

It requires little reflection to see that the fiercest disputes about religion revolve around what the Bible does *not* say, rather than what it *does* say — about words and phrases minted in the realm of speculative theology. Examples of this are the *homousios* and the *homoousios* from the notable Council of Nice. Men are neither wiser nor more intelligent after they learn the meanings of these words than they were before. As far as known on earth, there is no one listed in 'the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world' whose conversion or sanctification to God resulted from these controversies regarding human doctrines, nor from anything learned from the canons or creeds of all the councils, from Nice to the latest Methodist Conference.

It is a virtue, therefore, to forget this scholastic jargon and even the names of the dogmas that have shaken Christendom. It is a concession in light of the current crisis for the sake of peace to adopt the vocabulary of Heaven, and to return the borrowed nomenclature of the schools to its rightful owners — to cease speculating on the opinions of St. Augustine, St. Tertullian, St. Origen — to speak of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit — of the Gospel, of faith, of repentance, of baptism, of election, of the death of Christ, of His mediation, of His blood, of reconciliation, of the Lord's Supper, of atonement, of the church of God, etc. etc., using all phrases found in the Scriptures, without bias — to learn to love one another as much when we differ in opinion as when we agree, and to distinguish between the testimony of God and man's reasonings and philosophies about it.

I do not need to elaborate much on the topic of *human traditions*. They can easily be distinguished from the *Apostles' traditions*. The traditions of the Apostles are found in their writings, while those of men are found in their own works. Some human traditions may appear wise, but it's only an illusion. As long as it is written, 'In vain do you worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,' it will always be foolish presumption to add the commandments of men to the precepts of Jesus Christ. I know of only one way in which all believers in Jesus Christ can come together honorably—for themselves, honorably for the Lord, and beneficially for all of humanity. All have two superfluous chapters in their current ecclesiastical structures. The contents of these two chapters vary across all sects, but each sect includes these two chapters under some name. In some they are lengthy, and in others they are brief; but whether lengthy or brief, let everyone agree to remove them from their books and discard them, and be content with *faith, piety,* and *morality*. Let human philosophy and human tradition be cast overboard into the sea as any part of the Christian institution, and the church will then make a prosperous, safe, and joyful journey across the ocean of time, finally, under the triumphant flag of Immanuel, achieving a safe anchorage in the haven of eternal rest.

I appeal to every honorable, good, and loyal citizen of the kingdom of Heaven — to all who seek the good of Zion, who love the kingdom and the appearing of our common Lord and Savior, to consider whether such a concession is not due to the Lord, to the saints in Heaven and on earth, and to all of humanity in the current crisis we face; and whether we could propose less, or should demand more, than to make a whole burnt offering of all our "empty and deceitful philosophy," — our "science, falsely so called," — and our traditions received from our ancestors. I leave it to the good sense of every reasonable mind to decide whether such a whole burnt offering would be the most acceptable peace offering that could be presented on the altar of the Prince of Peace in our day; and whether, under the teachings of the Apostles of the Great Prophet, the church might again triumphantly stand on the sacred ground she once honorably occupied before Origen, Augustine, Athanasius, or the first Pope was born!

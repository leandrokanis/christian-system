# 2. Testimony

The Romans, from whom we have borrowed much of our language, referred to a witness as the *testis*. The declaration of this *testis* is still known as testimony. In relation to the material world around us and all objects that can be sensed, the eye, the ear, the smell, the taste, and the feeling serve as the five witnesses. What we call the evidence of sense, is, therefore, the testimony of these witnesses, which provide the five pathways to the human mind from the realm of nature. They are figuratively referred to as witnesses, and their evidence is called testimony. However, the report or declaration by intelligent beings, such as God, angels, and humans, constitutes what is properly and literally referred to as *testimony*.

Just as light reflected from any material object onto the eye brings that object into contact with the eye or allows the object to create its image on the eye, testimony regarding any fact brings that fact into contact with the mind, enabling it to leave an impression or to form its image on the intellect or mind of a person. Now, it should be noted that just as our five external senses provide us all information about the objects of sense around us, so too, through human or divine testimony, we receive all our information about facts that are not directly perceivable by our five senses.

To understand the full value of testimony in the divine work of regeneration, we need only reflect that all the moral facts which can shape moral character according to the divine model, or which can bring about a moral or religious change in individuals, are found in the testimony of God. Furthermore, no fact can have any impact where it is not present or where it is not known. The love of God as demonstrated in the death of the Messiah has never elicited a tear of gratitude or joy from any eye or stirred a grateful emotion in any heart among our race to whom the testimony never reached. No fact in the history of six thousand years, no act of God in creation, providence, or redemption, has ever influenced the heart of any man or woman who has not received that testimony. Thus, testimony is as essential in regeneration as the facts to which it speaks.

The real value of anything is the labor that it cost and its utility when acquired. If reason and justice were to settle all questions regarding the value of property, the conclusion would be that every item is worth the amount of human labor required to acquire it, and upon acquisition, it should also be evaluated for its utility. Now, since all the facts and all the truth necessary to renew human nature are found in the testimony of God, and since that testimony cost the labor and lives of the wisest and best who ever lived, it is just as valuable to us as the facts that it records, along with the labor and lives that it cost. It is equally indispensable in the process of regeneration as were the labors and lives of the Prophets, Apostles, and the Son of God.

History, or narrative, whether oral or written, is merely another term for testimony. Therefore, when we consider how much of both Testaments is devoted to history, we can understand its importance in the judgment of God. Prophecy, being the history of future facts or a record of things to be accomplished, belongs to the same category of facts and records. Now, if all past facts, future facts, or all history or testimony concerning them were to be erased from the volumes of God's inspiration, how small would what remains be! These considerations, when taken together, only partially illustrate the value and utility of testimony in the regeneration of mankind. However, its value will become even more evident when the true meaning of the term *faith* is fully presented to us.

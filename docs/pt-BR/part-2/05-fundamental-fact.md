# 5. Fundamental Fact

Amidst the uncertainty, darkness, and vice that spread across the earth, the Messiah appears and lays a foundation of hope, true religion, and religious union, unknown, unheard of, and unexpected among people. The Jews were united by blood relations and by agreement in a heavy ritual. The Gentiles rallied around every opinion and were grouped, like filings of steel around a magnet, under every possible shade of difference in thought concerning their mythology. As long as unity of opinion was seen as a proper basis for religious union, humanity has been distracted by the multiplicity and variety of opinions. Establishing what is called a system of orthodox opinions as the bond of union was, in fact, incentivizing new divergences in opinion, and leading to an ever-increasing number of opinions, sects, and divisions. Worse still, it was establishing self-love and pride as religious principles, fundamentally linked to salvation; a love regulated by similarity of opinion is merely a love for one’s own opinion; and all the zeal exhibited in its defense is but the workings of the pride of opinion.

When the Messiah appeared as the founder of a new religion, systems of religion made up of opinions and speculations about matter and mind, about God and nature, about virtue and vice, had been adopted, improved, reformed, and debunked time and again. It was generally felt and ultimately universally acknowledged that there was always something superfluous, something defective, something wrong, something that could be improved in every system of religion and morality. But the grandeur, sublimity, and beauty of the foundation of hope and ecclesiastical or social union, established by the author and founder of Christianity, consisted in this, that **the belief in one fact**, *supported by the best evidence in the world, is all that is required, as far as faith goes, for salvation.* The *belief in this* **one fact** *and submission to* **one institution** *expressive of it, is all that is required by Heaven for admission into the church.* A Christian, as defined, not by Dr. Johnson, nor any creed-maker, but by one taught from Heaven, is someone who believes this *one fact*, has submitted to *one institution*, and whose conduct aligns with the morality and virtue of the great Prophet. The one fact is expressed in a single proposition — *that Jesus the Nazarene is the Messiah.* The evidence upon which it should be believed is the testimony of *twelve men*, confirmed by prophecy, miracles, and spiritual gifts. The *one institution* is baptism in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Every such person is a disciple in the fullest sense of the word, the moment they have believed this one fact, based on the above evidence, and have submitted to the aforementioned institution; and whether they believe the five points condemned, or the five points approved by the synod of Dort, is not even to be questioned of them; whether they hold any views of the Calvinists or Arminians, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists, or Quakers, is never to be asked of such persons for admission into the Christian community called the church. The only doubt that can reasonably arise on these points is whether this *one fact*, in its nature and necessary results, can suffice for the salvation of the soul, and whether the open avowal of it, in the overt act of baptism, can be a sufficient recommendation of the person professing it to the confidence and love of the brotherhood. Regarding the first of these, it is repeatedly asserted, in the clearest language, by the Lord himself, as well as by the Apostles Peter, Paul, and John, that whoever believes the testimony that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, can overcome the world, has eternal life, and is, on God's veracity, saved from their sins. This should settle the first point; for the witnesses agree that whoever confesses that Jesus is the Christ and is baptized should be received into the church; and not a single instance can be found of anyone being asked for any other belief in order to gain admission, throughout the entire New Testament. The Savior expressly declared to Peter that upon this fact, that he was the Messiah, the Son of God, he would *build his church*; and Paul has expressly declared that "no other foundation can anyone lay (for ecclesiastical union) than that **Jesus is the Christ**." The point we’ve assumed is proved; and with this proof, everything necessary for the unity of all Christians upon a proper basis is established.

It must strike every thoughtful person that a religion requiring much mental abstraction or exquisite refinement of thought, or that calls for the comprehension or even understanding of refined distinctions and subtle nuances, is a religion not suited to humanity in their current circumstances. Presenting such a creed as the Westminster, whether adopted by Baptists or Paido-Baptists; such a creed as the Episcopalian, or indeed any sectarian creed, composed as they all are of propositions derived by logical inferences and articulated in philosophical language, to all those who are fit subjects for the salvation of Heaven — I assert, presenting such a creed to them for their examination or adoption defies all common sense. This harmful course is what has paganized Christianity. Our sects and parties, our disputes and speculations, our orders and castes, resemble anything but Christianity, that when we enter a modern synagogue or an ecclesiastical council, we feel as if we have stepped into a Jewish sanhedrin, a Muslim mosque, a pagan temple, or an Egyptian cloister rather than a Christian congregation. Sometimes, indeed, our religious meetings so resemble the Areopagus, the Forum, or the Senate, that we almost believe we have been transported to Athens or Rome. Even Christian orators emulate Demosthenes and Cicero. Christian doctrines are made to wear the guise of Egyptian mysteries, and Christian observances adopt the pomp and pageantry of pagan ceremonies. Unity of opinion, expressed in subscription to voluminous dogmas imported from Geneva, Westminster, Edinburgh, or Rome, is made the bond of union: and a difference in the tenth, or ten-thousandth shade of opinion, frequently becomes the actual cause of dismemberment or expulsion. The New Testament was not intended to occupy the same place in theological seminaries as the corpses of criminals are condemned to occupy in medical halls — first condemned to the gallows, and then to the dissecting knife of the spiritual anatomist. Christianity consists infinitely more in good works than in sound opinions; and while it is a joyful truth that whoever believes and is baptized shall be saved, it is equally true that whoever says, 'I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.'

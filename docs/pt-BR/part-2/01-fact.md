# 1. Fact

*Fact* means something that has been done. The term *deed,* which was common during the reign of James the First, is equivalent to our term *fact.* Truth and fact, though often confused, are not the same. All facts are truths, but not all truths are facts. That God exists is a truth, but not a fact; that He created the heavens and the earth is both a fact and a truth. That Paul was the Apostle of the Gentiles is a truth, but not a fact; and that he preached Christ to the Gentiles is both a fact and a truth. The simple agreement of the terms of any proposition with the subject of that proposition, or the representation of anything as it exists, is a truth. But something must be done, acted upon, or achieved before we have a fact. There are many things that are true in religion, morals, politics, and general science that are not facts; but these are merely the correspondence of words and ideas with the things they discuss. 

Facts have a power that logical truths do not possess; therefore, we say that facts are stubborn things. They are *things,* not *words.* The power of any fact is its meaning; and thus the measure of its power is the magnitude of its significance. All moral facts have a moral meaning; and those are properly called moral facts that either exhibit, develop, or form moral character. All those facts, or works of God, that are purely physical exhibit what have commonly been called His natural or physical perfections; and all those facts or works of God that are purely moral exhibit His moral character. It so happens, however, that all His works, when properly understood, exhibit both His physical and moral character when viewed in all their appropriate relations. Thus, the deluge demonstrated His power, justice, and truth; and therefore, displayed both His physical and moral grandeur. The turning of water into wine, apart from its design, is purely a demonstration of physical power; but when its design is understood, it has a moral force equal to its physical majesty. 

The work of redemption is a system of works, or deeds, on the part of Heaven, which constitutes the most splendid series of moral facts that man or angel has ever witnessed. And they serve as proof, argument, or demonstration of that regenerating proposition which presents God and *love* as two names for one idea. 

When these facts are understood or brought into direct contact with the mind of man as a moral seal or archetype, they imprint the image of God upon the human soul. *All the means of grace are, therefore, only the means of impressing this seal upon the heart; of bringing these* *moral facts to make their full impression on the soul of man.* Testimony and faith are merely the channels through which these facts, or the hand of God, draw the image on the heart and character of man. If both the fact and the testimony are gifts from God, we may rightly say that faith and eternal life are also gifts from God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

To enumerate the gospel facts would be to narrate all that is recorded of the sayings and doings of Jesus Christ, from His birth to His coronation in the heavens. However, they are concentrated in a few prominent ones, which collectively express all the love of God in the gift of His Son. He died for our sins, He was buried, He rose from the dead for our justification, and He ascended to the skies to prepare mansions for His disciples; comprehending the whole, or serving as the heads to the chapters that narrate the love of God and display His moral majesty and glory to our view. 

These moral facts reveal all the moral grandeur of Jehovah and make Jesus the reflection of His glory, the exact image of His substance. These are the moral seal that *testimony* conveys to the understanding, and *faith* brings to the hearts of sinners, by which God creates them anew and shapes them for His glory. It is the Spirit that bears witness â€” the Spirit of God and of Christ that gives the testimony and confirms it in the disciples. But let us now proceed to *testimony.*

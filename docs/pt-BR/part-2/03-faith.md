# 3. Faith

*No testimony, no faith:* for faith is only the belief in testimony or confidence in testimony as true. To believe without testimony is just as impossible as to see without light. The measure, quality, and power of faith are always found in the testimony believed.

Where testimony begins, faith begins; and where testimony ends, faith ends. We believe Moses only as far as Moses speaks or writes: and when Moses has recorded his last fact or testified his last truth, our faith in Moses terminates. His five books are, therefore, the length and breadth, the height and depth, or, in other words, the *measure* of our faith in Moses. The *quality* or value of faith is found in the quality of the testimony. If the testimony is valid and authoritative, our faith is strong and effective. 'If,' says John, 'we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater,' stronger, and more worthy of credit. The value of a bank bill is the amount of the precious metals it represents and the indisputable evidence of its genuineness; similarly, the value of faith is the importance of the facts presented by the testimony and the assurance that the testimony is true. True, or genuine faith, may be contrasted with feigned faith; but true faith is the belief in truth: for he who believes a lie believes in vain.

The *power* of faith is also the power or moral weight of the testimony or of the facts represented by the testimony. If, by faith, I am filled with joy or overwhelmed with sorrow, that joy or sorrow comes from the facts contained in the testimony or from the nature and relation of those facts to me. If faith purifies the heart, works through love, and overcomes the world, this power resides in the facts believed. If a father feels more joy in believing that a lost son has been found than in believing that a lost sheep has been brought back to his fold, the reason for this greater joy lies not in the nature of his belief but in the nature of the facts believed.

Here I am prompted to expand on a very popular and harmful misconception of modern times. The misconception is that the nature, power, or saving efficacy of faith is not in the truth believed, but in the *nature* of our faith or in *the manner of believing* the truth. Hence all that meaningless jargon about the nature of faith and all those disdainful sneers at what is called "historic faith," — as if there could be any faith without history, written or spoken. Who has ever believed in Jesus Christ without hearing the history of him? '*How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?*' Faith can never be more than receiving testimony as true, or believing testimony; and if that testimony is written, it is called history — though it is just as much history when it flows from the tongue as when it flows from the pen.

Let it be repeated and remembered that there is no other way to believe a fact than by receiving it as true. If it is not received as true, it is not believed; and when it is believed, it is no more than regarded as true. This being conceded, it follows that the efficacy of faith is always in the fact believed, or the object received, and not in the nature or manner of believing.

"Faith was bewildered much by men who meant  
To make it clear, so simple in itself.  
  
A thought so rudimentary and so plain,  
That no commentary could make it more clear.  

All faith was one. In object, not in kind,  
The difference lay. The faith that saved a soul,  
And that which in the common truth believed,  
In essence, were the same. Hear, then, what faith,  
True Christian faith, which brought salvation, was:  
Belief in all that God revealed to men;  
Observe, in all that God revealed to men,  
In all he promised, threatened, commanded, said,  
Without exception, and without a doubt."<sup>2</sup>  

This holds universally in all the sensitive, intellectual, and moral powers of man. All our pleasures and pains, all our joys and sorrows, result from the objects of sensation, reflection, faith, etc., being apprehended or received, and not from the nature of the exercise of any power or capacity with which we are endowed. We will illustrate and confirm this assertion by appealing to the experience of all.

Let us glance at all our sensitive powers. If, when observing a beautiful landscape with my eyes, I feel pleased, and when surveying a battlefield strewn with the spoils of death, I feel pained, — is it truthful to say that the pleasure or pain received came from the nature of vision or the mode of seeing? Was it not *the sight,* the thing seen, the object of vision, that produced the pleasure and the pain? The action of looking or the mode of seeing was the same in both cases, but the things seen or the objects of vision were different; — consequently, the effects produced were different.

If when hearing the melody of the grove I am delighted, and on hearing the peals of thunder shattering the cloud, dark with horror, hanging over my head, I am terrified, — is the delight or terror to be attributed to the manner or nature of hearing, or to the thing heard? Is it not the thing heard that produces the delight or terror?

If I am refreshed by the balmy fragrance of the opening bloom of spring, or sickened by the fetid odor of putrid carcasses, — are these effects ascribed to the peculiar nature or mode of smelling, or to the thing smelled? Or when the honey and the bile come into contact with my taste, — is the sweet or the bitter to be regarded as the effect of my manner of tasting or the object tasted? And when I touch the ice or the blazing torch, — is the effect or feeling produced attributed to the manner of feeling them or to the thing felt? Can we not affirm that all the pleasures and pains of sense, all the effects of sensation, result not from the manner in which our five senses are exercised, but from the objects on which they are exercised? It may be said, without in the least invalidating this conclusion, that the more intimate the exercise of our senses is with the things on which they are exercised, the stronger and more forceful the impressions made will be: but still it is the object seen, heard, smelled, tasted, or felt that affects us.

Transitioning from the outward to the inward man, and examining the powers of intellect one by one, we will find no exception to the law that applies to all our sensitive powers. It is neither the faculty of perception nor the manner of perception, but the thing perceived that incites us to action: it is not the exercise of reflection, but the thing reflected upon: it is not memory, nor the exercise of recollection, but the thing remembered: it is not imagination but the thing imagined: it is not reason itself, nor the exercise of reason, but the thing reasoned upon, that provides pleasure or pain — that incites to action — that cheers, allures, consoles — that grieves, disturbs, or troubles us.

Moving to our volitions and emotions, we will find the same universality. In a word, it is not choosing or refusing; it is not loving, hating, fearing, desiring, or hoping; it is not the nature of any power, faculty, or capacity of our nature, nor the simple exercise of them, but the objects or things upon which they are exercised that give us pleasure or pain; that motivate us to action or influence our behavior. Faith, then, or the capacity to believe, must be an anomalous thing; a power *sui generis;* an exception to the laws under which every power, faculty, or capacity of man is placed unless its measure, quality, power, and efficacy are in the facts that are testified to, in the objects on which it focuses.

There is no connection of cause and effect more intimate; there is no system of dependencies more closely linked; there is no arrangement of things more natural or necessary than the ideas represented by the terms *fact, testimony, faith,* and *feeling.* The first is for the last, and the two intermediates are made necessary by the force of circumstances as the means to the end. The fact, or the thing said to be done, produces the change in the frame of mind. The testimony, or the report of the thing said or done, is essential to belief; and belief in it is necessary to bring the thing said or done to the heart. The change of heart is the end proposed in this part of the process of regeneration; and we may see that the process on the part of Heaven is, thus far, natural and rational; or, in other words, consistent with the constitution of our nature.<sup>3</sup>

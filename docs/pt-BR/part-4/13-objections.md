# Objections

We will state and examine some objections that have already been partially addressed; however, since they are the most common or may become common, we will provide them with a formal statement and a formal refutation.

**Objection 1. — "To make the attainment and enjoyment of *present salvation*, pardon, justification, sanctification, reconciliation, and adoption dependent upon the availability of water being present or accessible is beneath the dignity and character of salvation from God."**

To make the attainment and enjoyment of present salvation, pardon, etc., dependent upon the availability of faith being present or accessible — upon the blood of Jesus Christ being acknowledged or known — is equally objectionable; for what is faith but the belief in testimony? Or, what is it in the most popular sense but something created in the heart, a mixture of knowledge and feeling, of assent and consent? Are not both the blood and faith less accessible to people than the element of water? Is there not more water available than faith or than candidates for baptism? Is there not as much power, wisdom, and goodness of God in creating water as in creating air, words, letters, faith, etc.? Is not water more universal than language, words, books, preachers, faith, etc.? This objection applies as much to any one means of salvation as it does to another; indeed, against all means of salvation. Whenever there is a case of much faith and little water, or of little faith and no water, we will address it with different arguments than these.

**Objection 2. — "It makes void the value, excellence, and importance of both faith and grace."**

Not at all. If a person says, with Paul, that we are justified by faith, does it follow that grace is made void? Or, if someone says we are justified by grace, does it make the blood of Christ ineffective? Or, if, with Paul, someone says we are justified by his blood, does it render faith, repentance, and grace meaningless? No, this actually gives faith its proper place and due value. It makes it the principle of action. It leads us to the water, to Christ, and to heaven. *But it is a principle of action only.* It was not Abel's faith in his head or heart; it was Abel's faith at *the altar* that earned him such a reputation. It was not Enoch's faith in principle, but Enoch's faith in his *walk with* God that translated him to heaven. It was not Noah's faith in God's promise and warning, but his faith manifested in *building an ark* that saved himself and his family from the flood and made him an heir of a new world, an heir of righteousness. It was not Abraham's faith in God's call, but his *going out* in obedience to that call that first distinguished him as a pilgrim and began his reputation. It was not faith in God's promise that Jericho would fall, but that faith expressed in the *blowing of rams' horns* that brought its walls down, etc. It is not our faith in God's promise of forgiveness; it is our *going down* into the water that obtains the remission of sins. But anyone can see why faith is so highly praised and valued. Because, without it, Abel would not have offered more sacrifices than Cain; Enoch would not have walked with God; Noah would not have built an ark; Abraham would not have left Ur of the Chaldeans, nor offered his son on the altar. Without it, Israel would not have passed through the wilderness nor crossed the Jordan; and without it, none would receive the remission of their sins in baptism. Moreover, we would remind the reader that when he speaks of being saved by faith, he should remember that grace is not overlooked; nor is blood, nor water, nor reformation dismissed.

We enter the kingdom of nature by being born of the flesh. We enter the kingdom of heaven, or come under the reign of Jesus Christ in this life, by being born of water and the Spirit. We enter the kingdom of eternal glory by being born again from the earth, and neither by faith nor the first regeneration. Neither by faith nor baptism, but by being counted worthy of the resurrection of the just. "I was hungry, and you fed me." Not because you believed, or were born of water; but because "I was hungry, and you fed me," etc.

There are three births, three kingdoms, and three salvations. One from the womb of our first mother, one from the water, and one from the grave. We enter a new world on, and not before, each birth. The present animal life at the first birth; the spiritual, or the life of God in our souls, at the second birth; and the eternal life in the presence of God at the third birth. And anyone who dreams of entering the second kingdom or coming under the dominion of Jesus without the second birth may, to complete his error, dream of entering the kingdom of glory without a resurrection from the dead.

Grace precedes all these births — shines in all the kingdoms; but it will be glorified in the third. Sense is the principle of action in the first kingdom; faith in the second; and spiritual sight in the third. The first salvation is that of the body from the dangers and ills of life, and God is thus "the Savior of all men." The second salvation is that of the soul from sin. The third is that of both soul and body united, freed from moral and natural corruption, and welcomed into the presence of God, when God shall be all in all.

**Objection 3. — "It is so uncharitable to the Paidobaptists!"**

And how uncharitable are the Paidobaptists to the Jews, Muslims, and non-believers!! Will they promise present salvation from the guilt, pollution, and dominion of sin, along with a well-founded hope of heaven to Jews, Muslims, non-believers, or even Roman Catholics? Or will Roman Catholics offer it to them? How uncharitable are those who accuse us of being "uncharitable"! Infants, those with cognitive disabilities, deaf and mute individuals, innocent non-believers wherever they may be found, along with all the pious Paidobaptists, we commend to the mercy of God. But for those who willfully *despise* this salvation, and who, having the opportunity to be immersed for the remission of their sins, willfully *despise* or refuse it, we have as little hope for them as they have for all who reject salvation *on their own terms of the gospel*. While they criticize us for placing scriptural and natural emphasis on immersion, do we not see that they place an equally significant, albeit unscriptural and irrational emphasis on their baptism or sprinkling, to the extent of administering it *without faith*, even to infants, as soon as they are born of the flesh?

**Objection 4. — "But do not many of them enjoy the present salvation of God?"**

How far they may find happiness in the peace of God and the hope of heaven, I cannot say. However, we know enough about human nature to say that those who *imagine* themselves pardoned will feel as happy as those who are genuinely so. But one thing we do know, that none can *rationally*, and with *certainty*, enjoy the peace of God and the hope of heaven except for those who intelligently and in full faith are born of water, or immersed for the remission of their sins. Since the testimony of God, and not mere conceit, imagination, or our reasoning about what occurs in our minds, is the basis for our certainty, we know and feel that we have an assurance that they cannot possess. We have this advantage over them; we once stood on their ground, but they have not stood on ours, nor felt our assurance. Furthermore, the experiences of the first converts demonstrate the difference between their form of baptism and the immersion or sprinkling of modern practices.

**Objection 5. — "This truth has been so long concealed from the people, and has only recently come to light, that we cannot accept it."**

This objection would have nullified every attempt at reformation or enlightenment of the mind, or any change in the condition and experiences of society made throughout history. Besides, do the experiences of all the religious — the observations of the insightful — the practical outcomes of all creeds, reforms, and improvements — and the hopes and desires of society, not warrant the conclusion that either some new revelation, or some new development of the revelation of God, must be made before the hopes and dreams of all true Christians can be realized, or Christianity can save and reform the nations of this world? We seek the old gospel back and want it supported by the ancient order of things: and this alone, through the blessing of the Divine Spirit, is all that we truly need or can expect to reform and save the world. If this gospel, as proclaimed and enforced on Pentecost, cannot achieve this, the hopes and expectations of the so-called Christian world are in vain and doomed to be disappointed.

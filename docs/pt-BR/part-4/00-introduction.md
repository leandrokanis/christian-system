# Introduction

Luther stated that the doctrine of justification, or forgiveness, is the measure of a church's strength or weakness. If correct in this regard, the church could not be far off in other matters; however, if mistaken here, it would be hard to believe it was right in anything else. I am recalling this from memory, but this was the essence of that great reformer. We share his views on this matter, as well as many other beliefs. Emerging from the smoke of the great city of mystical Babylon, he saw as clearly and as far into these issues as anyone could in such a murky environment. Many of his ideas simply need to be developed to their logical conclusion, and we would arrive at the ancient gospel as a result.

The doctrine of remission is synonymous with the doctrine of salvation; to discuss salvation without understanding the remission of sins is to speak without meaning. To give the Jews “a knowledge of salvation through the remission of their sins” was the mission of John the Baptist, as proclaimed by the Holy Spirit. In this way, he prepared a people for the Lord. This doctrine of forgiveness was gradually revealed to the people during the ministries of John and Jesus, but was not fully realized until Pentecost, when the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven were completely unveiled to humanity.

From Abel to the resurrection of Jesus, transgressors obtained remission at the altar through priests and sin offerings; however, it was an *imperfect* remission concerning the conscience. “For the law,” says Paul, “which is more perfect in this respect than the previous system, contained only a shadow of the good things to come, and not the exact representation of those things, can never, with the same sacrifices which they offer yearly forever, perfect those who come to them. If they had been able to provide this perfection, would they not have ceased to be offered? Because the worshippers, once purified, would no longer have a conscience of sins."

The *good things* to come were still future during the reign of Moses and his system. They have now arrived; and a clear, full, and perfect remission of sins is the significant outcome of the new system for all citizens of the kingdom of Jesus. The perfection of the consciences of God's worshippers under Christ is the key distinguishing feature when compared to those under Moses. They possess not only clearer understandings of God, His love, His character, and immortality, but also consciences that the Jewish and Patriarchal ages could not produce.

If faith alone were the means for this higher perfection and enjoyment, and if striking symbols or types were all that was necessary to provide this assurance and experience of pardon, the Jewish people might have been as happy as Christians. They had as true a testimony, as strong a faith, and as striking emblems as we do. Many of them, through their faith, gained a great reputation, were approved by God, and admired by men for their remarkable achievements.

The difference lies in the constitution. They lived under a constitution of *law* — we live under a constitution of *favor*. Before the law, their privileges were even more limited. Under the governance of the Lord Jesus, there is an institution for the forgiveness of sins, unlike any institution that has existed since the beginning of the world. It was because of this institution that Christians were initially so distinguishable from the subjects of all previous institutions.

Our political happiness in these United States is due to no other cause than our political institutions. If we are politically the happiest people in the world, it is because we have the most favorable political institutions in the world. The same principle applies to the Christian institution. If Christians were, and can be, the happiest people that ever lived, it is because they live under the most gracious institution ever granted to humanity. The meaning of this institution has been buried under the debris of human traditions for hundreds of years. It was lost during the dark ages and has only recently been rediscovered. Various efforts have been made, and significant progress has been achieved; however, since the Grand Apostasy was completed, until the present generation, the gospel of Jesus Christ has not been revealed to mankind in its original clarity, simplicity, and majesty. A veil has obscured the understanding of the New Institution in the hearts of Christians, just as Paul notes it was upon the hearts of the Jews when reading the Old Institution towards the end of that era.

The aim of this essay is to present to the reader the Christian institution for the remission of sins; to demonstrate by what means a person can attain the assurance of a personal and complete remission of all sins. We will attempt to do this by stating, illustrating, and proving the following *twelve* propositions: (See next chapter)

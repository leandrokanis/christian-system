# Recapitulation

As the Christian faith relies on, and Christian practice stems from, *the testimony of God*, rather than the reasoning of men; — I will, in this recapitulation, only highlight the evidence for one single proposition, assumed, supported, and illustrated in the preceding pages; that is the *ninth proposition*, sustained by the apostolic testimony. We aim to emphasize to the diligent reader the great importance attached to Christian immersion, as presented in the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles.

1. **In the Gospels — it is called *the forgiveness of sins*.** Matthew and Mark introduce the Messiah in His own person in giving the commission. Luke does not. Matthew presents Jesus saying, "Go, make disciples of all nations, immersing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things I have commanded you." This, of course, is for salvation. Mark presents Him saying, "Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to all creation; whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned." Luke, however, does not introduce the Lord in His own person when giving the charge; instead, he records it in his own interpretation in the following words: — That "repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." No one, I presume, will question that Luke records the commission in this way; — and, if so, then it is undeniable that as Luke neither mentions faith nor baptism, he substitutes for them the accepted meanings of both, when and where he wrote. Metonymically, he replaces repentance, or rather *reformation*, for faith; and *forgiveness of sins* for baptism. In Luke's understanding and time, forgiveness of sins stood for baptism, and reformation for faith — the effect for the means or cause. The only reference to the commission found in John occurs in 20:21. "As the Father has sent me, so I am sending you: — if you forgive anyone's sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven." Here, there is neither faith, repentance, nor baptism; but the object, *forgiveness of sins*, is literally offered. In the commission, salvation is connected by the Lord Jesus to faith and baptism in His name. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved. Thus, baptism is taught in the testimonies of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

2. **In the Acts of the Apostles —** In Peter's first sermon, he says, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus, for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." In his second sermon, he says, "Repent and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, and that He may send Jesus," etc. In the same address, he adds, "God raised up His Son Jesus and sent Him to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways." In his third sermon, recorded in Acts 10:1-48, he states, "All the prophets testify about Him that everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins *through His name*." Paul, in Antioch of Pisidia, proclaims that through Jesus, forgiveness of sins is announced; and that by Him, everyone who believes is justified from everything. Ananias commanded Paul to get up and be baptized, and to wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord. Thus, it is described in the Acts of the Apostles.

3. **In the Epistles —** The Romans are said to have been baptized into Christ Jesus — into His death; to have been buried with Him, and consequently to have risen with Him, and to walk in a new life. The Corinthians are said to have been washed, justified, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God. The Galatians "were baptized into Christ, and have clothed themselves with Him." The Ephesians were united to Christ through baptism, as brides were accustomed to be washed before their nuptials. The assembly of the disciples, referred to as *the congregation of the Lord*, forming the bride of Christ, was said to be *cleansed* by *the washing of water* and *the word*. The Colossians were *buried with Christ, raised with Him*, and are said to have been *forgiven all their sins* when they were raised with Him, where their resurrection with Jesus and their complete forgiveness of sins are linked. All the saints are said to be saved by baptism, or "the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit." The believing Jews had their hearts sprinkled clean from a guilty conscience and their bodies washed with pure water. Peter taught all the saints in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, that baptismal water saved them, just as the flood saved Noah in the ark; and that through baptism, a person is cleansed from all former sins. And John the Apostle depicts the saved as having "washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb," and represents all baptized little children as "having their sins forgiven." Such are the evidences found in the Epistles. How numerous! How clear! And how unequivocal! Are we not, therefore, justified in saying that unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God? And that all who, believing, are baptized for the remission of their sins, obtain the remission of their sins in and through baptism?

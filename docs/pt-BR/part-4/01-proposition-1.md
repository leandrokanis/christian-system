# Proposition 1

***The Apostles taught their disciples, or converts, that their sins were forgiven, and uniformly addressed them as pardoned or justified individuals.*** 

John testifies that the youngest disciples were pardoned. "I write to you, little children, because your sins *are forgiven you* on account of his name." He commends the young men, strong in the Lord, and the old men, steadfast in the Lord, for their achievements; but he addresses the *little children,* the youngest converts, as possessing this blessing that is common to all disciples: "Your sins are forgiven you, *on account of his name.*" 

Paul, in his letter to the Hebrews, asserts that one of the provisions of the New Institution is *the remission of the sins of all under it.* "*Their sins* and iniquities I will remember no more." From this, he argues, as a fundamental principle of the Christian economy, "Now where remission of these is, no more offering for sin is needed." The reason given by the Apostles for why *Christians* have no *sin offering* is that they have obtained remission of sins as a standing provision in the New Institution. 

The same Apostle testifies that the Ephesian disciples had obtained remission. "Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God for Christ's sake *has forgiven you.*" Here, too, in the enumeration of Christian privileges and immunities under Christ, he asserts forgiveness of sins as a common blessing for all disciples. "In whom we have redemption through his blood, even *the forgiveness of sins,* according to the riches of his grace." In his letter to the Colossians, he uses the same wording— "By whom we have *the forgiveness of sins.*" 

Figurative expressions are used by the same Apostle to convey the same forgiveness that is common to all Christians. "And such (guilty characters) were some of you; but *you are washed;* but *you are sanctified;* but *you are justified* by the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of God." Peter is also a witness here. "Seeing *you have purified your souls* by obeying the truth through the Spirit." 

But there is no need for foreign, remote, or figurative expressions when the Apostles assert it so literally and repeatedly as one of the components of being a disciple of Jesus. If we had no other testimony than that found in a single letter to the Colossians, it would be sufficient to support this position. The command given in chapter 3:13 assumes it as a principle. "*As Christ forgave you, so also do you.*" But in the second chapter, he makes this an inseparable component of being in Christ: "You are *complete* in him — circumcised — buried with him — raised with him — made alive with him — **having forgiven you all trespasses**." 

These explicit testimonies from the most notable witnesses support my first proposition. On these evidences I rely, and I will henceforth speak of it as a truth that should not be questioned, namely, that all the disciples of Christ converted in the apostolic age were taught by the Apostles to consider themselves as pardoned individuals.

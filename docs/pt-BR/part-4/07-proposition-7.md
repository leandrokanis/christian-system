# Proposition 7

***A change of views, though it necessarily precedes, is in no case equivalent to, and should never be identified with, a change of state.***

In all aspects of life, in all states or conditions of people, we recognize the truth of this; and I wish our readers could see just as clearly what is infinitely more important for them: that no change of heart is equivalent to, or can replace, a change of state! A change of heart is the result of a change of views, and whatever can bring about a change of views may lead to a change of heart or feelings, but a change of state always requires something more. 

Lavinia was a servant of Palemon and once considered him a harsh master. She changed her views about him, and her feelings towards him changed as well; however, she remained in the state of a handmaid. Palemon first offered her his heart, and then his hand, and she accepted both. He vowed and she vowed before witnesses, and she became his wife. It was then, and not before, that her state changed. She is no longer a *servant* — she is now a *wife.* A change of views and feelings led to this change in state; but it should be noted that this might not have resulted in a change of state; for Maria, who was another handmaid of Palemon, changed her views of him and her feelings towards him just as much — indeed, more than Lavinia did. Yet Maria lived and died as Palemon's servant maid.

William Agricola and his brother Thomas, both Canadians, once strongly opposed the established government of New England. They both changed their views, and as a result, their feelings were changed. William became a citizen of Rhode Island; but Thomas, despite his change of heart, lived and died a colonial subject of a British king.

John and James Superbus became great enemies of one another. They remained irreconcilable for many years. Eventually, a change of views led to a change of heart: but this change was concealed in their hearts for more than a year and appeared in no overt act. They were not reconciled until mutual concessions were made and pledges of a change of feelings were offered and accepted. From enemies, they became friends.

A thousand analogies could be presented to show that although a change of state often — indeed, generally results from a change of feelings, which in turn arises from a change of views, yet a change of state does not usually follow and is something entirely different from, and cannot be identified with, a change of heart. Similarly, in religion, a person may change their views of Jesus and their heart may change towards Him; but unless a change of state occurs, they remain unpardoned, unjustified, unsanctified, unreconciled, unadopted, and lost to all Christian life and joy. For it has been proven that these terms represent states and not feelings, condition and not character; and that a change of views or heart is not the same as a change of state. To change a state is to enter into a new relationship, and relationship is not sentiment or feeling. Some *act*, then, constitutional, by stipulated proposal, sensible, and evident, must be performed by one or both parties before such a change can take place. Hence, historically, the proclamation of the gospel was always accompanied by some instituted act proposed to those whose views had changed, by which their state would be transformed, and by which they would assume a new relationship to Jesus Christ.

This brings us to “*the obedience of faith.*” From the time the proclamation of God's love was first made, there was an act of obedience proposed within it that put believers in actual possession of its blessings, and by conforming to this act, a change of state followed.

To understand what this act of faith is, it is important to note that where there is no *command*, there can be no *obedience.* These are related terms. A message or proclamation that does not have a command in it cannot be obeyed. But the gospel can be obeyed or disobeyed, and therefore, it contains a command. To avoid any hesitation in a matter of such significance, we will prove,

# Proposition 6

***My sixth proposition is that the first Christians were taught by inspired teachers to consider themselves as saved individuals.***

Due to the ambiguity surrounding the term *saved* when referring to the disciples of Christ, we will define its usage in this proposition. I do not need to elaborate on the temporal saviors and salvations that are prevalent in sacred history. It is unnecessary to mention that Noah and his family were saved from the judgment that fell upon the Old World; that the Israelites were saved from the Egyptians and all their enemies; that Paul's companions were saved from the deep; and that God's people throughout the ages, along with all humanity, have been saved from countless dangers to which their lives, families, and possessions have been exposed. It is not about the current salvation of our bodies from the troubles of this life; rather, it is about *the salvation of the soul* from the guilt, pollution, and dominion of sin. "You shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." It is the salvation of the soul in the present life that we are discussing. It should be clearly stated that there is a *present* and a *future* salvation, both of which all Christians are meant to participate in. The former is rightly called *the salvation of the soul*, and the latter is *the salvation of the body*, at the resurrection of the righteous. There are few who profess Christianity, and perhaps none, who do not anticipate a future salvation — the glory of salvation to be revealed to us in the last time. Peter, who uses this phrase at the beginning of his first epistle, invites the saints to look forward to the salvation that is yet to come and, in the same context, reminds them that they have *now* received the salvation of the soul. Indeed, the salvation of the soul is merely the *first fruit* of the Spirit and serves as a guarantee until the adoption, "the redemption of the body" from the bondage of corruption. It was in this sense that salvation was proclaimed to all who submitted to the Lord Jesus, and thus it is in this context equivalent to a deliverance of the soul from the guilt, pollution, and dominion of sin. Having defined the present salvation of the soul, I will proceed to prove my sixth proposition, namely, that the first Christians were taught by their inspired teachers to consider themselves as *saved individuals*.

On Pentecost, Peter urged the Jews to *save themselves* from that corrupt generation by repenting and being "baptized for the remission of their sins in the name of the Lord Jesus." Luke, in recounting the success of Peter's efforts, writes: "And the Lord added daily, *the saved* to the church."<sup>22</sup>

Those who obeyed the gospel were noted by Luke as "*the saved*." The translators for the King’s James Version inserted the words "*should be*" from their own interpretation. These words do not appear in any manuscript of the Greek Scriptures. This is the first instance of the term "*the saved*" in the Christian Scriptures.

Paul uses the same phrase in his first letter to the Corinthians, applying it to all the disciples of Jesus. "To those who are perishing, the message of the cross is foolishness; but to us, *the saved*, it is the power of God."<sup>23</sup> In the same letter, he speaks of the Gospel, "By which *you are saved*, if you hold fast to the word that I preached to you."<sup>24</sup> In his second letter, he uses the same language and identifies the disciples with the same terminology: "We are to God the fragrance of Christ among *the saved* and among the perishing." The Ephesians he declares *are saved* by grace; and to Titus, he states, "God has *saved* us, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his own mercy" — by means that Paul will clarify soon. Promises of salvation for the obedient can be found in almost every public address made by the Apostles and earliest preachers. For the Savior commanded them to assure humanity that everyone who believes the gospel and is baptized should be saved. And, linking faith with baptism, Peter asserted that baptism *saved* us, purifying the conscience through the resurrection of Jesus.<sup>25</sup>

While Christians are taught to look forward to and hope for a *future* salvation — a salvation from the power of death and the grave — a salvation that will be revealed in the last time — they receive the first fruit of the Spirit, the salvation of the soul from guilt, pollution, and the dominion of sin, and come under the rule of righteousness, peace, and joy. This is what Peter affirms about all Christians in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia Minor, and Bithynia, saying to them: "Jesus, whom you have not seen, you love; in him, though you do not now see him, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, *the salvation of your souls*."<sup>26</sup>

These six propositions, each clearly supported by the unequivocal testimony of God, as presented, and as well-known to the discerning disciple, backed by many more equally clear and compelling passages not mentioned here, converge into one main proposition, which we shall consider as irrefutably established in this essay.

*The converts made to Jesus Christ by the Apostles were taught to regard themselves as pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved; and they were addressed as pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved individuals by all who first preached the Gospel of Christ.*

While this proposition stands, it may be useful to note that all these terms reflect not any quality of mind — not any personal attribute of body, soul, or spirit; but each represents, and all together represent *a state* or *condition*. However, although these terms represent state and not character, there exists a relationship between state and character, an influence that state has over character, which renders the state immensely significant from a moral and religious perspective.

Indeed, the strongest arguments that the Apostles present to Christians to encourage them in cultivating and displaying all moral and religious excellences of character are drawn from the meaning and value of the *state* in which they find themselves. Because they are forgiven, they should forgive; because they are justified, they should live righteously; because they are sanctified, they should live holy and blamelessly; because they are reconciled to God, they should pursue peace with everyone and act kindly towards all; because they are adopted, they should walk in the dignity and purity of children of God; because they are saved, they should abound in thanksgivings, praises, and rejoicing, living soberly, righteously, and godly, looking forward to the blessed hope.

As this essay is intended for readers of basic understanding and general education, I trust I may be permitted to explain even more clearly the distinction between *state* and *character*. Childhood is a state; so is adulthood. A person in the state of childhood may sometimes behave like someone in adulthood, and those who have reached adulthood may at times act like those in childhood. A person in the state of a son may have the character of a servant; and a person in the state of a servant may exhibit the character of a son. Although this is not typically expected, it can happen. Parents and children, masters and servants, husbands and wives are terms denoting relationships or states. To act in accordance with these states or relationships is quite different from merely being in one of these states. Many individuals enter the state of marriage yet act unworthy of it. The same is true for many other states. Enough has been said, I believe, to distinguish state and character, and relationships from moral qualities.

It is hardly necessary to mention here that since the disciples of Christ are declared to be in a pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved state, they are the only ones in such a condition, and all others are in an unpardoned, unjustified, unsanctified, unreconciled, unadopted, and lost state.

*When, then, is a change of state brought about, and by what means?* This is the key question that is about to be discussed.

We must acknowledge that a change in any one of these states necessarily implies a change in all the others. Everyone who is *pardoned* is justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved; and thus, everyone that is *saved* is adopted, reconciled, sanctified, justified, and pardoned.

To illustrate what has already been proven, let us examine some of the changes that occur in present society. A woman changes her state. She enters into the state of marriage. Once she has surrendered herself to the loving authority and control of her husband, she has not only become a wife but also a daughter, a sister, an aunt, a niece, etc., and may now stand in many other relationships that she didn’t have before. All these roles are connected with her new status as a wife of a person who holds many relationships. Similarly, when a person becomes a follower of Christ, they become a descendant of Abraham, an heir, a brother, or are pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved.

To be *in* Christ, or *under* Christ, means to hold these new relationships with God, angels, and men; and to be outside of Him, or not under His mediatorship or authority, is to be in Adam's state. It means to be in what is known as "the state of nature," unpardoned, unjustified, unsanctified, unreconciled, and estranged from the family of God, lost in transgressions and sins.

With these considerations in mind, the question arises, *When are individuals in Christ?* I choose this phrase to accommodate the familiar terminology of today. No individual *in* a house, *in* a ship, *in* a state, or *in* a kingdom is so without having been brought *into* that house, *into* that ship, *into* that state, or *into* that kingdom; thus, no person is *in* Christ but one who has been brought *into* Christ. The language of Scripture is very precise. We find the phrases "*in Christ*" and "*into Christ*" repeatedly in the Christian Scriptures; however, in no instance can one phrase replace the other. Therefore, in every context where anyone is said to be *in Christ*, it does not refer to their conversion, regeneration, or putting on Christ, but rather to a state of rest or privilege that follows conversion, regeneration, or putting on Christ. In contrast, the phrase *into Christ* is always associated with conversion, regeneration, baptism, or putting on Christ, translation into His kingdom, or submission to His authority.<sup>27</sup>

Assuming that our readers are knowledgeable enough to recognize that this is not merely a matter of wordplay, but a distinction that reveals a foundational principle of an apostate church, I will present another preliminary proposition, which I choose to express in the following words, *to wit*:

# Proposition 11

***All the Apostolic Fathers, as they are called; all students of the Apostles; and all notable ecclesiastical writers of the first four Christian centuries, whose writings have reached us; refer to, and speak of, Christian immersion as the "regeneration" and "remission of sins" mentioned in the New Testament.***

I shall support this proposition with the testimony of those who have examined the entirety of Christian antiquity and by citing the words of those commonly known as the Apostolic Fathers, along with other distinguished writers from the first four hundred years. We will first call upon one whose name is well-known throughout Christendom. Regardless of whether the work is genuine or spurious, it is universally acknowledged as a fragment of the highest antiquity: —

## Barnabas

In his Catholic Epistle, chapter 11, he states, "Let us now inquire whether the Lord took care to manifest anything beforehand regarding water and the cross. Concerning the former, it is written to the people of Israel that they shall not receive that baptism which brings forgiveness of sins, but shall institute another for themselves that cannot. For thus says the Prophet, 'Be astonished, O heavens! and let the earth tremble at it; because this people have done two great and wicked things: They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and have dug for themselves broken cisterns that can hold no water. Is my holy mountain Zion, a desolate wilderness? For she shall be like a young bird when its nest is taken away.' — 'Consider how he has joined both the *cross* and the *water* together. For he says, "*Blessed are they who, putting their trust in the cross, descend into the water;* for they shall receive their reward in due time; then, says he, will I give it to them." But concerning the present time, he says, "Their leaves shall not fail." This means that every word that goes out of your mouth, through faith and charity, will lead to the conversion and hope of many. In similar fashion, another Prophet speaks: 'And the land of Jacob was the praise of all the earth;' thus magnifying the vessels of his Spirit. And what follows? 'And there was a river running on the right hand, and beautiful trees grew by it; and whoever eats from them shall live forever.' The significance of this is: — *that we go down into the river full of sins and impurities, but come up bearing fruit; having in our hearts the fear and hope found in Jesus by the Spirit:* 'And whoever eats from them shall live forever.' That is, whoever listens to those that call them and believes shall live forever."

## Clement and Hermas

The former provides no testimony on the subject. The latter states the following.

In speaking of a tower built upon the water, by which he signifies the building of Christ's church, he says: — "Hear, therefore, why the tower is built on the waters: — Because your life is saved, and shall be saved, by water." In response to the question, "Why did the stones come up into this tower out of the deep?" he says it was necessary for them to come up by (or *through*) water so that they might be at rest; "for they could not otherwise enter the kingdom of God; for before anyone *receives the name of the Son of God,* he is liable to death; but when he receives that *seal,* he is delivered from death and assigned to life. Now, that seal is *water,* into which individuals go down, facing death, but emerge assigned to life; for this reason, the seal was also preached to them, so that they could enter the Kingdom of God."

Both Clement and Hermas wrote at the end of the first or beginning of the second century.

Additionally, Hermas states as follows in another of his works, titled "The Commands of Hermas."

"And I said to him, I have just heard from certain teachers that there is no other repentance besides that of *baptism,* when we go down into the water and *receive the forgiveness of sins,* and after that, we should sin no more, but live in purity. And he said to me, *You have been rightly informed.*"

Having closely and repeatedly examined the Epistles of Clement; of Polycarp to the Philippians; of Ignatius to the Ephesians; that to the Magnesians; that to the Trallians, the Romans, the Philadelphians, the Smyrnians, and his Epistle to Polycarp; together with the Catholic Epistle of Barnabas and the genuine works of Hermas, I can assert that the preceding extracts are the only passages in all these writings that speak of immersion.

Having heard the Apostolic Fathers, as they are called, testify to the views of the pupils of the Apostles, down to A.D. 140; I will summon a very learned Paidobaptist antiquarian, who can present every writer and Father, down to the fifth century; and, before we hear any of his witnesses, we shall interrogate him regarding his own convictions after he has spent many years examining all of Christian antiquity: —

***Testimony of Dr. W. Wall, Author of the History of aBaptism***

Pray, Doctor, have you examined all the primitive writers from the death of John down to the fifth century?

*W. Wall.* — I have.

And will you explicitly state what the established and universal view of all Christians, public and private, was for four hundred years from the birth of the Messiah, concerning the meaning of the saying (John 3:5), "Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God?"

*W. Wall.* — "There is not a single Christian writer of any antiquity in any language who does not understand it as referring to *baptism;* and if it is not understood this way, it is difficult to explain how a person is born of *water,* just as it would be to explain how one is born of *wood.*"

Did all the Christians, public and private, and all the Christian writers from Barnabas to the times of Pelagius (419), as far as you know, continue to use the term *regenerate* as *solely* applicable to immersion?

*W. Wall.* — "The Christians did, throughout all ancient times, continue to use this term '*regeneration*' for *baptism;* so that whenever they used the word '*regenerate*' or '*born again,*' they meant, or referred to it as *baptism.* And almost all the quotations I include in this book will serve as examples of this."

Did they also substitute words such as *renewed, sanctified, sealed, enlightened,* in place of *baptism* and *baptize,* as well as *regenerated?*

*W. Wall.* — "To *baptize,* they used the following terms: — Most commonly, *anagennao,* to regenerate; sometimes, *kainopoieo,* or *anakainiozo,* to renew, frequently, *agiazo,* to sanctify. At times they refer to it as *the seal;* and often as *illumination,* as it is also called, Heb. 6:4, and at other times, *teliosis,* initiation." "St. Augustine, no fewer than a hundred times, expresses *baptized* by the word *sanctified.*"

Now we shall see some of Mr. Wall's witnesses; and I prefer to introduce them in his own words, as he cannot be presumed partial to the views I have presented in this essay: —

## Justin Martyr

Justin Martyr wrote about forty years after the death of John the Apostle and stands most prominent among the primitive Fathers. He addressed an apology to Emperor Antoninus Pius. In this apology, he narrates the *practices* of Christians and the reasons for them. Regarding those who are persuaded and believe the things being taught, and who promise to live according to them, he writes —

"Then we bring them to a place where there is water, and they are *regenerated* in the same manner of *regeneration* by which we were *regenerated:* for they are washed in water (*en to udati*) in the name of God the Father and Lord of all things, and of our Savior Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit; for Christ says, unless you are regenerated you cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; and everyone knows it is impossible for those who are once generated (or born) to enter again into their mother's womb."

"It was foretold by Isaiah, as I said, by what means those who should repent of their sins might escape them; and it is written in these words, 'Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean, put away the evil,' etc."

"And we have been taught by the Apostles this reason for this practice. Because we, being ignorant of our first birth, were generated through necessity (or the natural course) and have been raised in all customs and behaviors, should not remain children of that necessity and ignorance, but of will (or choice) and knowledge, and should obtain *forgiveness of the sins* in which they have lived, through water (or in water). Then, the name of God the Father, etc., is invoked over the one who wishes to be *regenerated.* And this washing is referred to as *the enlightening.*"

As you trace the history of infant baptism, Mr. Wall, as closely to apostolic times as possible, pray, why do you quote Justin Martyr, who never mentions it?

*W. Wall.* — "Because his account is the most ancient concerning *the way of baptizing,* next to the scriptures; and it shows the plain and simple manner of administering it. Because it illustrates that the Christians of those times (many of whom lived during the days of the Apostles) used the term '*regeneration*' (or '*born again*') for *baptism;* and that they were taught to do so by the Apostles. And because we see from it that they understood John 3:5. as referring to water baptism; and so did all the writers of these 400 years, **not one man excepted**."

Did any of the ancients use the word *matheteueo* (to disciple) as it is used in the commission; or did they refer to the baptized as *discipled?*

*W. Wall.* — "Justin Martyr, in his second apology to Antoninus, uses it. His words are: — 'Several individuals among us, aged sixty and seventy, of both sexes, *who were discipled* (*matheteuio*) to Christ, in or from their childhood, continue uncorrupted.'"

As soon as they began to mystify, they started to teach that immersion *without faith* would obtain remission of sins, and that immersion *without faith* was regeneration. Then came the debates about *original sin:* and once original sin was established, the need for infant immersion for the remission of original sin arose. And so undisputed was the meaning of baptism for remission, that when the Pelagians denied original sin, pressed with difficulty, "why immerse those who have no sins?" they were forced to invent *actual sins* for infants; such as their crying, irritability, restlessness, etc., for which they assumed that infants could rightly be immersed, despite lacking original sin.

## Tertullian

Tertullian, the first to mention infant baptism, flourished around A.D. 216. He wrote against the practice, and among his most conclusive arguments against infant immersion (when sprinkling was not a practice), he assumes, as a fundamental principle not to be questioned, that immersion was for the remission of sins; and, this being universally accepted, he argues as follows: —

"Our Lord does indeed say, 'Do not forbid them to come to me;' therefore, let them come when they have grown up — let them come when they understand — when they are instructed where it is that they are coming. Let them be made Christians when they can know Christ. What need does their *guiltless* age have to rush to *the forgiveness of sins?* People proceed more cautiously with worldly goods; and he who should not have earthly goods entrusted to him, yet shall have heavenly ones! Let them know how to desire this salvation, so that you may appear to have given to one who asks." 

## Origen

Origen, though a great visionary, is nevertheless a competent witness in any factual question. And here I would again remind the reader that we summon these ancient writers as witnesses in a matter of *fact,* and not of *opinion.* It is not to relay their opinions, nor the reasons behind them, but to testify to what were the views of Christians regarding this institution in their times. There was no controversy on this subject for more than four hundred years, and thus we expect to find only incidental references to it; but these are numerous and of the most unquestionable character. Origen, in his homily on Luke, states: —

"Infants are baptized for the forgiveness of their sins. Of what sins? Or when have they sinned? Or how can any legal rationale apply to them, except according to the sense we just mentioned? (that is) none is free from pollution, even if his life has lasted only a single day on earth."

And in another place, he says that —

"The baptism of the church is given for the forgiveness of sins." And again —

"If there were nothing in infants that needed forgiveness and mercy, the grace of baptism would be unnecessary to them."

In another place, he says —

"But in the *regeneration,* (or new birth), through the *laver* (or baptism), everyone who is born again of water and the Spirit is cleansed from pollution: cleansed (as I may dare to say) as through a glass darkly."

But now let me ask Dr. Wall, — Do Gregory Nazianzen, Basil, Ambrose, Chrysostom, and St. Augustine, concur with all their predecessors in their views on regeneration and remission?

*W. Wall.* — "Yes, exactly. I have noted that among the various names the ancients give to *baptism,* they frequently mean the sacrament of baptism by this term, '*the forgiveness of sins.*' And as for Chrysostom, he expressly states, 'In baptism, or the spiritual circumcision, there is no trouble to undergo but to shed off the burden of sins, and to receive pardon for all preceding offenses.' And again; 'There is no receiving or having the bequeathed inheritance before one is baptized; and no one can be called *a son* until baptized.'"

The controversies regarding infant baptism and original sin were concurrent; and as soon as they decided the nature and extent of original sin, baptism for the remission of sins was given to infants because of this pollution, and defended due to the necessity of regeneration and forgiveness for salvation; and because immersion was universally considered to be the scriptural regeneration and remission. In this way, there is no reasonable doubt that infant baptism began; and, for convenience, as Dr. Wall contends, it was replaced by infant sprinkling.

Unless we were to transcribe all the testimonies of antiquity, one by one, there can be no greater assurance given than that for more than four hundred years after Christ, all writers, orthodox and heterodox, Pelagius and Augustine not excepted, concurred in the prevailing views. If I were to summon others — Eusebius, Dupin, Lightfoot, and Hammond, *cum multis aliis* — they would provide the same testimony.

We will conclude this proposition with the testimony of the most renowned of the Bishops of Africa. I extract it from a work that is currently widely read, called "The History of Martyrs." It is from Cyprian's account of his conversion. 

## Cyprian

"While (he says) I lay in darkness and uncertainty, I thought about what I had heard regarding a second birth proposed by divine goodness; but I could not comprehend how a man could receive a new life from being immersed in water, cease to be what he was before, and still remain the same body. How, I asked, can such a change be possible? How can someone who has grown old in a worldly way of living strip himself of his former inclinations and deep-rooted habits? Can someone who has spent his entire time in indulgence and forbidden pleasures ever transform into a model of restraint and sobriety? Or can one who has always appeared in splendid attire stoop to the bare, simple, and unembellished dress of common folk? It is impossible for a person who has held the most honorable positions to ever submit to leading a private and obscure life; or that someone who was never seen in public without a throng of attendants and individuals seeking to elevate their fortunes through him should ever endure solitude. This (he continues) was my way of reasoning: I thought it impossible for me to abandon my previous way of life and the habits to which I was then accustomed; but no sooner did the life-giving water wash the stains from my soul than my heart received the heavenly light of the Holy Spirit, which transformed me into a new creature; all my difficulties were cleared, my doubts dissolved, and my darkness dispelled. I was then able to do what had previously seemed impossible; I recognized that my former life was earthly and sinful, due to the impurity of my birth; yet my spiritual birth granted me new ideas and inclinations, directing all my views toward God."

Cyprian flourished A.D. 250.

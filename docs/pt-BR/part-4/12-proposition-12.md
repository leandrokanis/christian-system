# Proposition 12

***But even the reformed creeds—Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Baptist—substantially affirm the same views of immersion, though they seem hesitant to put them into practice with faith.***

This proposition will be supported by extracts from the creed of each of these denominations.

## Episcopalian

The clergy are instructed, before proceeding to baptize, to make the following prayer:

"Almighty and everlasting God, who by your great mercy saved Noah and his family in the Ark from perishing by water; and also led the children of Israel, your people, safely through the Red Sea—symbolizing the holy baptism; and by the baptism of your beloved Son Jesus Christ in the River Jordan, sanctified the element of water in the mystical washing away of sin; we beseech you, for your infinite mercies, to graciously look upon *these* your *servants*; wash *them* and sanctify *them* with the Holy Spirit; that *they*, being delivered from your wrath, may be received into the Ark of Christ's Church; and being steadfast in faith, joyful through hope, and rooted in charity, may pass through the waves of this troublesome world, that finally *they* may come to the land of everlasting life; there to reign with you, world without end, through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen.*"

After reading a part of the discourse with Nicodemus, they are instructed to make the following exhortation:

"Beloved, you hear in this gospel the express words of our Savior Christ: that unless a person is born of water and the Spirit, they cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. From this, you can perceive the great necessity of this sacrament where it is available. Likewise, immediately before his ascension into heaven (as we read in the last chapter of St. Mark's Gospel), he commanded his disciples, saying, 'Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.' This also shows us the great benefit we gain thereby. For this reason, St. Peter the Apostle, upon his first preaching of the gospel, many were pricked at the heart and said to him and the rest of the Apostles, 'Men and brethren, what shall we do?' He replied, 'Repent and be baptized every one of you for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit; for the promise is for you and your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call.' And with many other words, he exhorted them, saying, 'Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.' For as the same Apostle testifies elsewhere, even baptism now saves us (not through the removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a clear conscience)—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Therefore, do not doubt, but earnestly believe that he will favorably receive *these* present *persons,* truly repenting and coming to him by faith; that he will grant *them* remission of *their* sins, and bestow upon *them* the Holy Spirit; then he will give *them* the blessings of eternal life and *make them participants* in his everlasting kingdom."

This, I need not add, is in accordance with the sentiments expressed in this essay. What a pity that the Episcopal Church does not believe and practice its own creed!

## Presbyterian

The Presbyterian Confession, on Baptism, chapter 28, section 1, declares that —

"Baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ, not only for the solemn admission of the baptized person into the visible church; but also to serve as a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, of their engrafting into Christ, of regeneration, of remission of sins, and of their yielding to God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in newness of life; this sacrament is, by Christ's own appointment, to be continued in his church until the end of the world."

"*A sign and seal of remission of sins!!*" This is much closer to the truth than this church seems to recognize. However, it cannot believe its own creed; for it does not believe that baptism is a sign and a seal of remission of sins, nor of regeneration in its own interpretation for its baptized or sprinkled infants. But if it were to pay any regard to the Scriptures, it could not say less than it has stated. It is no wonder that many sectarians cannot be persuaded to think that the Scriptures mean what they say; for they are so accustomed to saying what they do not mean that they cannot think God does mean what he says.

## Methodist

The Methodist Creed states—

"Dearly beloved, since all men are conceived and born in sin (and what is born of the flesh is flesh, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God but live in sin, committing many actual transgressions), and that our Savior Christ states, 'None shall enter into the Kingdom of God, except they be regenerated and born anew of water and of the Holy Spirit'; I implore you to call upon God the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that of his bounteous goodness he will grant to *these persons* that which by nature *they* cannot have; that *they* may be baptized with water and the Holy Spirit, and received into Christ's holy church, and made lively *members* of the same."

Then it is directed that the minister say or repeat the following prayer:

"Almighty and immortal God, the aid of all who need, the helper of all who flee to you for refuge, the life of those who believe, and the resurrection of the dead: We call upon you for *these persons*; that *they*, coming to your holy baptism, may receive remission of *their* sins through spiritual regeneration. Receive *them,* O Lord, as you have promised by your beloved Son, saying, 'Ask, and you shall receive; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it will be opened to you.' So give to us that ask; let us that seek, find; open the gate to us that knock; that *these persons* may enjoy the everlasting blessing of the heavenly washing, and may come to the eternal kingdom which you have promised through Christ our Lord. *Amen.*" — *Dis. p.* 105.

Thus, the Methodist Creed and Church are nearly as scriptural as the church from which they originated. They pray for those to be baptized that in baptism they may receive the remission of sins! Does she believe what she says?

## Baptist

***Chapter* XXX. *Section* 1**.—

"Baptism is an ordinance of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ, to serve as a sign of the baptized person's fellowship with him in his death and resurrection; of their engrafting into him; of remission of sins, and of their yielding to God, through Jesus Christ, to live and walk in newness of life."

The Baptist Church follows the Presbyterian Church as closely as the Methodist Church follows the English hierarchy. But it acknowledges its faith that immersion is a *sign* of remission. A sign of the past, the present, or the future! An accompanying sign!

## The Confession of Bohemia.

"We believe that whatever is signified and witnessed in the outward ceremony of baptism, all of that the Lord God performs inwardly. That is, he washes away sin, begets a person again, and bestows salvation upon them; for the bestowing of these excellent fruits was holy baptism given and granted to the church."

## The Confession of Augsburg.

"Concerning baptism, they teach that it is necessary to salvation, as a ceremony ordained of Christ; also, that through baptism the grace of God is offered."

## The Confession of Saxony.

"I baptize you—that is, I witness that by this dipping your sins are washed away, and that you are now received by the true God."

## The Confession of Wittenberg.

"We believe and confess that baptism is that sea, into the depths of which, as the Prophet says, God casts all our sins."

## The Confession of Helvetia.

"To be baptized in the name of Christ is to be enrolled, entered, and received into the covenant and family, and thus into the inheritance of the sons of God; that is to say, to be called the sons of God, to be purged from the filthiness of sins, and to be endowed with the manifold grace of God, to lead a new and innocent life."

## The Confession of Sueveland.

"Regarding baptism, we confess that it is the source of regeneration, washes away sins, and saves us. But all these things we understand as St. Peter interprets them, as stated in 1 Peter 3:21."

## Westminster Assembly.

"Before baptism, the minister is to use some words of instruction—showing that it is instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ; that it is a seal of the covenant of grace, of our engrafting into Christ, and of our union with him, of remission of sins, regeneration, and eternal life."

The Roman Catholic and the Greek Church say, "We believe in one baptism for the remission of sins."

Calvin makes remission the principal aspect of baptism.

"Baptism," he says, "resembles a legal instrument properly attested, by which he assures us that all our sins are canceled, effaced, and obliterated so that they will never appear in his sight, will not come into his remembrance, or be imputed to us. For he commands all who believe to be baptized for the remission of their sins. Therefore, those who have imagined that baptism is nothing more than a mark or sign by which we profess our religion before men, as soldiers wear the insignia of their sovereign as a mark of their profession, have not considered what is the *principal* thing in baptism; which is that we should receive it with this promise—'He who believes and is baptized will be saved.'"

"The ancient Christian church, from the highest antiquity, after the apostolic times, generally appears to have thought that baptism is absolutely necessary for all who would be saved by the grace of Jesus Christ."

"Most of the ancients concluded that baptism was no less necessary to salvation than faith or repentance itself."

John Wesley, in his commentary on the New Testament (p. 350), speaks more clearly than the earlier Methodist Discipline or the Regular Baptist Confession. His words are:

"Baptism, administered to true penitents, is both a *means* and a *seal* of pardon. Nor did God ordinarily in the primitive church bestow this (pardon) on any unless through this means."

This is almost, if not entirely, as much as we have said about the forgiveness of sins through immersion.

May we not say that we have upheld this last proposition to the fullest extent of its terms?

With the testimony of John Wesley, the last of the reformers, I conclude my list of witnesses for the significance of Christian immersion. I could greatly expand this list; indeed, I have been quite surprised while looking back into creeds, councils, commentators, and reformers, both ancient and modern. I fear that I shall be suspected of reaching the conclusions I have presented from consulting human writings, creeds, and reformers. My concerns are not that we, who advocate for reformation, may appear to have nothing *original* to offer in this reformation; that we are mere gatherers in the fields cultivated by other minds. It is not for this reason that we feel anxious, for the reformation we support is not characterized by new and original ideas or human inventions, but by a return to the original ideas and institutions developed in the New Testament. However, we fear that some may suspect the views presented to be a human invention or tradition because we have found so much support for them in the works of the most ancient and renowned Christian writers, as well as the creeds of ancient and modern reformers. We assure our readers, however, that we have come to these conclusions from the simple reading and impartial examination of the New Testament alone. Moreover, we may add that we are as astonished as any reader of this essay can be to find such a multitude of witnesses to the truth and significance of the views presented.

The propositions now proved and illustrated must convince all that there is *some connection* between immersion and the forgiveness of sins. What that connection is may be disputed by some, but that such a connection exists cannot be disputed by those who acknowledge the New Testament as containing a divine message to humanity. With John Wesley, we affirm it is "to the believing the *means* and *seal* of pardon for all previous offenses"; and we not only say we *think* so, but we preach it as such and practice it accordingly. Those who contemplate any other connection would do well to clarify what they mean, for we are confident there is no meaning in any other connection. To treat it as a commemorative sign of past remission is an affront to all rules of interpretation and a perfect anomaly in all revelation from God. To view it, prospectively, as a sign of future remission faces the same challenges. What remains is for it to be considered for what it truly is—the accompanying sign of an accompanying remission; the sign and the seal, or the means and the seal, of remission granted through the water, connected with the blood of Jesus, by divine appointment, and through our faith in it.

We have heard some objections, and we can conceive of others that might be raised against *immersion for the remission of sins.* There can be objections made against any person, doctrine, sentiment, or practice—natural, moral, political, or religious—that has ever existed. But despite all the objections raised to everything, there are thousands of matters and truths we hold to be indubitable facts. Among these certain and sure things, unshakeable, is the Christian institution.

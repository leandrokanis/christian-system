# Proposition 3

***The ancient Christians were addressed by the Apostles as sanctified individuals.***

Paul addressed all the disciples in Rome as saints or sanctified individuals. In his first letter to the Corinthians, he refers to them all as *the sanctified* in Christ Jesus. "To the congregation of God which is at Corinth, to *the sanctified* in Christ Jesus." Paul argues with the Hebrews that "by the will of God we are sanctified by the offering of Jesus Christ once for all." "For by this one offering he has forever *perfected* (the conscience of) the *sanctified*." It was so common for the Apostles to refer to their disciples as sanctified individuals that sometimes they are designated as such in the titles of their letters. For example, Jude, addressing the entire Christian community, opens his general epistle â€” "To *the sanctified* by God our Father and to those preserved (or saved) by Jesus Christ; to the called." "The sanctifier and the sanctified are all from one family," says the Apostle to the Gentiles. Therefore, the sanctifier addressed the sanctified as his brothers and the brothers referred to the disciples as sanctified. But once more, we must listen to Paul, who connects his sanctification with the *name* of the Lord Jesus. He states, "But now you are sanctified by *the name* of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."

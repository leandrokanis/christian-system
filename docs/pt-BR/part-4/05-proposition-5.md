# Proposition 5

***The first disciples were considered and addressed by the Apostles, as "adopted into the family of God."***

This adoption is presented by the Apostle as the great reason which called forth the Son of God. "God," he says, "sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, that he might buy off those under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons." "And because you *are sons,* he sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying *Abba,* Father."20 "You are, therefore, now sons of God."

Indeed, the same writer, in his letter to the Ephesians, goes still farther, and represents this adoption of Jews and Gentiles into the rank and dignity of the sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty, as the great object contemplated in God's predestination. "Having," says he, "predestinated, or beforehand determinately pointed us out, for an *adoption* into the number of children by Jesus Christ, *for himself,* according to the good pleasure of his will."21 Another testimony must suffice on this point. "Beloved," says the Apostle John, "*now* are we *the sons of God;* and what manner of love God has bestowed upon us, that we should be called *sons of God!*" "If sons, then we are heirs of God â€” joint heirs with Christ."

# Proposition 10 

***I now proceed to show that immersion and the washing of regeneration are two biblical names for the same act, viewed from two different perspectives.*** 

The term *regeneration* appears only twice in the common version of the New Testament, and not once in the Old Testament. The first instance is in Matt. 19:28: "You who have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of his glory, you also will sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." Dr. George Campbell, following the punctuation adopted by Griesbach and substituting the word *renovation* for *regeneration,* translates it as, "That at the *renovation*, when the Son of Man shall be seated on his glorious throne, you, my followers, sitting also on twelve thrones," etc. *Genesis*, being a term used for *creation*, *palingenesia*, denotes the new creation — either literally at the resurrection of the dead, figuratively at the beginning of the Christian era, or at the starting of the Millennium. Josephus, the Jew, referred to the return of Israel to their own land and institution as "The Regeneration" or "Palingenesia." 

No prominent writer or critic, nor any expositor, suggests that *regeneration* in Matt. 19 refers to what is typically considered in theology as the *new birth* or *regeneration of the soul* — not even the Presbyterian Matthew Henry, nor Dr. Whitby, Campbell, Macknight, Thompson; nor, indeed, any author I can recall reading. In this passage, regeneration denotes a state, a new state of affairs. We often use the term in the same way. The American Revolution was the regeneration of the country or the government. The beginning of the Christian era was a regeneration — so will the creation of the new Heaven and new Earth. Since this is such a clear point, and so generally accepted, we will move on to the second occurrence of this term. 

"God saved us by *the washing of regeneration,* and the renewing of the Holy Spirit." God has saved us through the *bath of regeneration* and the renewal of the Holy Spirit. This is the second time the word *regeneration* is found in the New Testament; and here it is acknowledged by the most learned Paidobaptists and Baptists that it refers to immersion. Although I have come to this conclusion based on my views of the Christian religion, I don’t hold it on that basis alone, nor do I justify it to others this way. I would prefer to establish it through other testimonies than by those who agree with me on this institution. Among these testimonies, I will cite Dr. James Macknight, formerly the prolocutor or moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, and translator of the Apostolic Epistles. One of his comments on Titus 3:5 reads: “Through the bath of regeneration.” “Through *baptism*, called the bath of regeneration, not because any change in nature” (though I wouldn’t say in the *state*) “of the baptized person is produced by baptism; but because it is an emblem of the purification of his soul from sin.” He then cites in proof, (Acts 22:16:) “Arise, and be immersed, and wash away your sins.” — *Paul.* He also supports this view from Eph. 5:26 and John 3:5. "The bath of regeneration," according to this learned Paidobaptist, is Christian immersion.

Parkhurst, in his Lexicon, connects the phrase *the washing or bath of regeneration* with Eph. 5:26 and John 3:5, alluding to immersion. All critics I know say the same. Even Matthew Henry, the good and venerable Presbyterian commentator, concedes this point as well and quotes Eph. 5:26, Acts 22:16, and Matt. 28:19-20, supporting the conclusion that the *washing of regeneration* refers to baptism.

With our opponents as judges, we have established this point: that the only occurrence of the phrase *washing of regeneration* in the New Testament, regarding personal change, means or is equivalent to immersion. *The washing of regeneration and immersion are therefore just two names for the same thing.* While I might be justified in moving on to another topic and assuming this point is fully established, I prefer, for the sake of *those who are slow to understand*, to support this conclusion with some other testimonies and arguments.

Since regeneration is understood to be equivalent to "*being born again,*" and is considered synonymous with a new birth, we will examine it under this metaphor. For if immersion is equivalent to regeneration, and regeneration is synonymous with being born again, then being born again and being immersed are the same thing; for this simple reason: that things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to each other. *Everyone must agree that no person can be born again of something he receives.* Just as no person is born naturally — so no person can be metaphorically born again of something he receives. It undermines the concept, the figure, the allusion, and everything else that allows the application of these words to any change that takes place in a person to suggest that the subject of the new birth, or regeneration, is born again of something he has received. This single observation demonstrates the impropriety and inaccuracy of thought; or, perhaps, the lack of thought that popular notions of regeneration promote and legitimize.

In being born naturally, there is the begetter and what is begotten. These are not the same. The act of being born is different from what is born. Now, the Scriptures carry this figure through every significant point of contact. There is the begetter. “Of his own will he has begotten or impregnated us,” says James the Apostle. “*By the word of truth,*” as the incorruptible seed; or, as Peter states, “We are born again, not of corruptible but of incorruptible seed, the word of God which endures forever.” But when the act of being born is discussed, then water is introduced. Thus, before we enter the kingdom, we are born of water.

The Spirit of God is the begetter, the gospel is the seed; and being thus begotten and quickened, we are born of water. A child is alive before it is born, and the act of being born merely changes its state, not its life. Just so, in the metaphorical birth. People are begotten by the Spirit of God, conceived by the word, and born of water.

In one sense, a person is born of his father; but not until he is first born of his mother. Thus, in every occurrence where water and the Spirit, or water and the Word, are discussed, *the water comes first.* Every child is born of its father when it is born of its mother. Thus the Savior put the mother first, and the Apostles follow. There is no other reason for putting the water first. How uniform this expression is! Jesus says to Nicodemus, “You must be born again, or you cannot discern the reign of God.” *Born again!* What does this mean? “Nicodemus, unless you are born of water and the Spirit you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.” Similarly, Paul speaks to the Ephesians in 5:26, “He cleansed the church,” or the disciples, “by *a bath of water, and the Word.*” And to Titus, he states, “He saved the disciples *by the bath* of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.” Now, as soon as a disciple who has been begotten of God is born of water, he is born of God, or of the Spirit. *Regeneration is, therefore, the act of being born.* Hence its constant connection with water. Reader, reflect — what a confusion, what a muddle, have the mystic scholars created around this metaphorical expression and the topic of regeneration! To call the reception of any spirit, influence, energy, or operation upon the human heart, regeneration, is an abuse of language, as well as a departure from the language of the Holy Spirit, *who refers to nothing personal as regeneration except the act of immersion.*

Some curious criticisms have been offered to escape the force of the clear declarations of Jesus and his Apostles on this subject. Some argue that the words, “Unless a man is born of water and Spirit,” should not be understood literally. Surely if to be born of water does not mean to be born of water, then to be born of the Spirit must mean something different from being born of the Spirit. This is so fanatical and extravagant that it requires no further exposure. He who cannot see the appropriateness of calling immersion a being born again can see no appropriateness in any metaphor in common use. A resurrection is a new birth. Jesus is said to be the *firstborn* from the dead because he was the first to rise from the dead to die no more. And surely there is no misuse of language, but the greatest appropriateness in saying that he who has died to sin and has been buried in water, when raised up again from that element, is born again or regenerated. If Jesus was born again when he came out of the tomb, surely he is born again who rises up out of the grave of waters. 

Those who are begotten and born of God are children of God. It would be a monstrous assumption to believe that such individuals are not freed from their sins. *To be born of God while being born in sin is conceivable.* Remission of sins is as certainly granted to "*the born of God*" as eternal life and deliverance from corruption will be granted to the *children of the resurrection* when born from the grave. 

To illustrate what we presume has now been proven, we will consider *political regeneration.* While the term *regeneration* is loosely used in this context, through such a license of speech, we can illustrate this subject for everyone’s understanding. Yes, the whole theme of faith, the change of heart, regeneration, and character.

All civilized nations and kingdoms have constitutions; and in their constitutions they declare who are members of the social compact. Besides those who make up the community at the time a constitution is adopted, they specify who will share its blessings in all time to come; that is, who will be admitted into it and by what means they will become members of it. They have always decreed that their own descendants will inherit their political rights and privileges. But they have also ordained that foreigners, that is, members of other communities, can become, by adoption or naturalization, citizens, or fellow members of the same community. However, they have, in their wisdom and benevolence, instituted a rite or form of adoption, which has significant meaning; and which, when submitted to, changes the state of the subject involved. Now, as the Savior consented to be called a *King* and to designate the community over which he presides as a *Kingdom,* it was due to the analogy between these human institutions and his own; and to aid the human mind in understanding and grasping the great object of his mission to the world. It is also worth noting that **when he spoke of a kingdom, he spoke of being born again.** Yes, on that occasion, and only on that occasion, when he spoke of *entering into his kingdom,* did he discuss the necessity of **being born again.** Had he not chosen that figure, he wouldn't have opted for the figure of *a new birth.* With these facts and circumstances before us, let us examine political regeneration as the best conceivable illustration of religious regeneration. 

A. B. was born in the island of Great Britain, a native subject of George III, King of Great Britain. He was very attached to his native island, to the people, the customs and traditions of his ancestors. As these attachments increased, he grew up to manhood. Then he heard reports of this good land, this large, fertile, and most desirable country. The country, the people, and the government were presented to him in the most favorable light. Sometimes these representations were exaggerated; but still, he could separate the truth from the embellishments: and he was fully convinced not only of the existence of these United States but also of the eligibility of being a citizen there. He believed the testimony he heard; resolved to expatriate himself from his homeland, risking life and property, he boarded a ship, bidding farewell to all his childhood companions, relatives, and dear friends. His conviction was so strong that old Neptune and King Eolus, with all their fears, could not daunt him. He sailed from his native shores and landed on this continent. However, he was ignorant of many things pertaining to this new country and government; and upon his arrival, he asked for the rights and privileges of a citizen. He was told that the civil rights of hospitality to a *stranger* could be extended to him as a *friendly alien*; but not one of the rights or privileges of a *citizen* could he have unless he were born again. “*Born again!*” said he, in a disappointed tone to Columbus, with whom he had his first conversation on the matter. “What do you mean by being born again?” 

*Columbus* — You must be *naturalized* or adopted as a citizen; or, what we call *born again.* 

*A. B.* — I do not understand you. How can a man be born when he is grown? 

*Col.* — That which is born of Great Britain is British, and that which is born of America is American. If you want to be an American citizen, you must be born of America. 

*A. B.* — "Born of America!" You astonish me. I have come to America, well disposed towards the people and the country. I was once attached to England, but I became attached to the United States; and because of my faith and attachments, I have come here; and will you not receive me into your kingdom because I could not help being born in England? 

*Col.* — As well disposed as I am, and as we all are, to receive you, I tell you most certainly, unless you are regenerated in a courthouse and enfranchised before the judges, you can never become a citizen of these United States. 

*A. B.* — Yours is an arbitrary and despotic government. What airs of sovereignty you have assumed! 

*Col.* — By no means. Right, reason, wisdom, policy, and benevolence for you, as well as the safety, dignity, and happiness of the entire community, require that every alien must be naturalized or made a citizen before exercising or enjoying the rights of a citizen. 

*A. B.* — You are certainly arbitrary — if not in the act of regeneration itself — in the place and manner in which it must be done. Why, for instance, must it be done in a *courthouse?* 

*Col.* — I will explain; because there are the *judges,* the *records,* and the *seal* of the government. 

*A. B.* — I understand you. Well, tell me, how is a man born again? Explain it plainly and without metaphor. 

*Col.* — With pleasure. You were born of your mother and father when you were born in England, and you were born *legitimately* according to English institutions. Therefore, you were born *of* England as well as born *in* it; and were, therefore, entirely English. That was your first birth. But you have expatriated yourself, as your application here shows — I say *sentimentally* you have expatriated yourself; but we need a formal *solemn pledge* of your renunciation; and we will give you a formal pledge of your adoption. You must, *ex animo*, in the presence of the Judges and the Recorders, renounce all allegiance to every foreign prince and potentate, and especially to His Majesty the King of Great Britain. 

*A. B.* — Is that the requirement? I can, with all my heart, renounce all *political* allegiance to every foreign ruler and government. Is that it? Then I have no objection. 

*Col.* — You must also: — You are not only to renounce all political allegiance; but you must also, from the soul, solemnly vow, in the presence of the same Judges and Recorders, that you will adopt and submit to the constitution and government of these United States. 

*A. B.* — I can do that too. I can renounce, and I can adopt; nor do I object to where it shall be done. But, pray, what solemn pledge will *you give me!* 

*Col.* — As soon as you have vowed your renunciation and adoption in the presence of the Judges and Recorders, we will give you a certificate with a *red seal*, the *seal of the state,* attached to it; stating that you, having now been naturalized, or born according to our institutions, are born *of* America; and are now a son, an adopted son, of America. That *red* seal indicates that the blood, the best blood of this government, will be shed for you, to protect you and defend you; and that your life will be, when needed, willingly given for your mother, *of* whom you have been politically born; just as it would have been for your own natural political mother, of whom you were first born. 

*A. B.* — I must subscribe to this. In my native language, it all means that I give myself up politically to this government, and it gives itself up to me, before witnesses too. How soon, pray, after this new birth may I exercise and enjoy all the rights of a citizen? 

*Col.* — They are yours the moment you take your first breath under your new mother. Indeed, we do not have any *symbol* through which a person is politically regenerated in these United States. We only ask for a solemn pledge and give one. Some nations have symbols. But we understand that the moment the vow is taken, the person is politically born again. And as every other child has all the rights of a child it can exercise as soon as it breathes air; so all our political children have all their political rights as soon as the form of naturalization is complete. But, remember, *not until then.* 

*A. B.* — You mentioned some nations had their symbols. What do you mean by that? 

*Col.* — I mean that the naturalized citizens had to undergo some emblematic rite, through which they were symbolically detached from every other people, and introduced among those who adopted them and whom they adopted. The Indian nations wash all whom they adopt in a running stream, imposing this task upon their women. The Jews circumcised and washed all whom they admitted to the rights of their institutions. Other customs and forms have been established in other nations; but we regard simply the meaning of the thing, and have no symbol. 

*A. B.* — I feel but little interested in that. I wish to become a citizen of these United States; especially as I am informed I can have *no* inheritance among you, nor a *voice* in the nation, nor any immunities unless I am born again. 

*Col.* — You must, therefore, submit to the institution; and I know that as soon as you are politically born again, you will appreciate this institution's importance and utility more than you can now; and you will be just as eager as I am to see others submit to this wise, wholesome, and benevolent institution. 

*A. B.* — As my faith brought me to your shores, and as I approve of your constitution and government, I will not (now that I understand your institutions) let an opportunity pass. I will head to the place where I can be born again. 

I ought to offer an apology for a phrase that appears frequently in this essay and dialogue. When we describe the subject of immersion as active, either expressly or impliedly, we depart from that style which corresponds with the figure of "*being born.*" For all persons are passive in being born. Thus, in immersion, the subject does not bury himself or raise himself; but is buried and raised by another. So that in the act, the subject is always passive. And it is to that act alone that we refer. 

From all that has been said about *regeneration*, and from the illustration just provided, the following conclusions must, we think, be apparent to all: —  

***First.*** Begetting and quickening necessarily precede being born. 

***Second.*** Being born imparts no new life; but is simply *a change of state*, introducing one into *a new mode of living.* 

***Third.*** Regeneration, or immersion — the former referring to the import of the act, and the latter term to the act itself — denote only the act of being born. 

***Fourth.*** God, or the Spirit of God, being the author of the whole institution, imparting to it its life and efficiency, is the *begetter* in the fullest sense of that term. Yet, in a subordinate sense, every one skilled in the word of God who converts another may be said to have begotten him whom he enlightens. So Paul says, 'I have begotten Onesimus in my bonds:' — and 'I have begotten you, Corinthians, through the gospel.' 

***Fifth.*** The gospel is described as *the seed* — the power and strength of the Holy Spirit to impart life. 

***Sixth.*** The significant argument relevant to our aim in this extensive discussion of conversion and regeneration is that which we believe to be the most evident of all other conclusions, viz: — that remission of sins, or coming into a state of acceptance, being one of the present privileges of the Kingdom of Heaven, cannot be scripturally enjoyed by any person before immersion. Just as one cannot be a citizen before being born, or enjoy the privileges of an American citizen while being an alien; one cannot enjoy the privileges of a child of God before being born again. For Jesus explicitly states that he has not granted the privilege of sons to anyone but those born of God. If, then, the present forgiveness of sins is a privilege and a right of those under the new constitution in the kingdom of Jesus; and if being born again, or being born of *water* and of the Spirit, is necessary for admission; and if being born of *water* means *immersion*, as clearly proven by all witnesses; then, remission of sins cannot, in this life, be constitutionally enjoyed prior to immersion. If there is any proposition regarding any part of the Christian institution which admits clearer evidence or fuller illustration than this one, I have yet to discover where it may be found. 

Before we dismiss the sixth evidence, which encompasses so many items, I would like to make a remark or two about the appropriateness of considering the term "immersion" as equivalent to the term "conversion." 

"Conversion" is widely understood as turning to God. Not merely thinking favorably of God, nor simply repenting for past misdeeds; but an actual turning to God, in deed as well as word. It is true that no person can be said to turn to God whose mind is not enlightened and whose heart is not favorably inclined towards God. All human actions that do not stem from previous thought or determination are more the actions of a machine than the actions of a rational being. "He that comes to God," or turns to him, "must believe that God exists and that he rewards everyone who diligently seeks him." Then he will seek and find the Lord. An "external conversion" is no conversion at all. A turning to God with the lips, while the heart is far from him, is mere pretense and mockery. But although I have never thought otherwise since contemplating religion, I understand the "turning to God," taught in the New Institution, to be a coming to the Lord Jesus — not a *thinking* about doing it, nor a *repenting* that we have not done it; — but an *actual coming* to him. The question then is, where shall we find him? Where shall we meet him? Nowhere on earth but in his institutions. "Where he records his name," there alone can he be found; for there only has he promised to be found. Hence, I assert that the first institution where we can encounter God is the institution for remission. It is also noteworthy that the Apostles, in all their speeches and responses to inquiries, never commanded an inquirer to pray, read, or sing, *as a precondition for coming; but always commanded and proclaimed immersion as the first duty or the first thing to be done after believing the testimony.* Therefore, neither praying, singing, reading, repenting, sorrowing, resolving, nor waiting to be better was the act of conversion. Immersion *alone* was the act of turning to God. Consequently, in the commission to convert the nations, the only institution mentioned after proclaiming the gospel was the immersion of believers, as the divinely authorized method of fulfilling and completing the task. And from the day of Pentecost to the final *Amen* in the revelation of Jesus Christ, no one was said to be converted or to have turned to God until they were buried and raised from the water. 

If it were not to treat this subject as one of disputed opinions, I would state that had there not been an act, such as immersion agreed upon by all to be the means of remission and the act of conversion and regeneration; the Apostles could not, with any regard for truth and consistency, have addressed the disciples as pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, and saved persons. If all this had depended upon some mental change, such as faith; they could never have addressed their congregations in any other way than moderns do: always phrasing it with doubt and uncertainty — hoping a little and fearing much. This method of address and the modern compared serves as positive proof that they viewed the immersed through one lens, and we through another. They taught the disciples to see not only themselves as saved individuals; but all whom they saw, or knew to be immersed into the Lord Jesus. They acknowledged everyone who came out of the water as *saved*, and recorded them as such. Luke writes, "The Lord added *the saved daily to the congregation*."

Whenever a child is born into a family, it is a brother or sister to all other children of the family; and being born of the same parents is the act that causes and declares its fraternity. Before emerging from the water, everything is mental and invisible; and as immersion is the first act commanded, and the first contractual act; it was in the commission, *the act* by which the Apostles were commanded to turn or convert those to God who believed their testimony. In *this* sense, therefore, it is the converting act. No person can, scripturally, be said to be converted to God until he is immersed. How ecclesiastics interpret their own language is no concern of ours. We stand for pure speech and for the apostolic ideas associated with it.

To return to the direct testimonies affirming remission of sins through immersion, we look to the Gentiles. Peter was sent to the house of Cornelius to tell him and his family “words by which they might be saved.” He addresses these words. He was interrupted by the miraculous descent of the Holy Spirit. It is essential to note, however, that the testimony to which the Holy Spirit set its seal was the following words: — “To *him*, all the prophets witness that everyone who believes on him *shall receive remission of sins in his name.*” While speaking these words about remission of sins through, or by his name, the Holy Spirit, in its marvelous gifts of tongues, fell upon them. 

Many, seeing the emphasis placed upon faith or belief, presume that all blessings flow from it *immediately.* This is a significant error. Faith, indeed, is the principle, and the distinguishing principle of this system: but it is only the principle of action. Therefore, we find the name or person of Christ always interposed between faith and the cure, whether mental or physical. The woman who touched the fringe of Jesus' garment had as much faith before as after; but though her faith was the cause of her reaching out her hand, and accompanied it; *she was not cured until she touched.* That great type of Christ, the brazen serpent, healed no Israelite merely by faith. The Israelites, as soon as they were bitten, believed it would heal them. Yet they were not cured as soon as they were bitten, nor until *they looked* to the serpent. It was one thing to believe that looking at the serpent would cure them; another to actually look at it. It was *the faith*, indirectly; but, *immediately, the look,* which healed them. It was not faith in the waters of Jordan that healed the leprosy of Naaman the Syrian. It was immersing himself in it, according to the command. It was not faith in the pool of Siloam that cured the blind man whose eyes Jesus anointed with clay; it was his washing in Siloam's water. Thus, the laying on of hands, a word, a touch, or a shadow, or something from the persons of those anointed with the Holy Spirit, was the *immediate* cause of all cures recorded in the New Testament. Indeed, it is true that without faith it is impossible to be healed; for in some places Jesus could not perform many miracles due to their unbelief. This is true for all moral remedies and cures. It is impossible to receive forgiveness of sins without faith. In this world of means (however it may be in a world without means), it is as impossible to receive any blessing through faith without the appointed means. *Both are indispensable.* Thus, *the name* of the Lord Jesus is interposed between faith and forgiveness, justification, and sanctification, even when immersion into that *name* is not detailed. It would have been unusual in the annals of the world for the historian to have recorded all the circumstances of the same institution in every reference to it; and it would have been equally unusual for the Apostles to have mentioned it always in the same words. Thus, in the passage before us, the *name* of the Lord is only mentioned. Similarly, in the first letter to the Corinthians, the disciples are portrayed as saved, washed, justified, and sanctified *by the name* of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God. The frequent interposition of the name of the Lord between faith and forgiveness, justification, sanctification, etc., is clarified in a remark made during James' speech in Jerusalem. It is an application of an ancient prophecy concerning the conversion of the Gentiles. The Gentiles are mentioned as turning to or seeking the Lord. But who are those thus converted? "Even all the Gentiles *on whom* my name is called." Therefore, it is to those *upon whom* the name of the Lord is called, that the name of the Lord communicates remission, justification, etc.

Some critical thinkers need to be reminded that while they sometimes find forgiveness, justification, sanctification, etc., attributed to grace, the blood of Christ, or the name of the Lord, without mentioning faith; we sometimes find faith, grace, and the blood of Christ, without any mention of water. Now, if they have any logic or right to assert that faith is understood in one case; we have equal logic and right to claim that water or immersion is understood in the other. Their argument is that in many places this matter is made sufficiently clear. This is also our argument — in numerous places this matter is made abundantly clear. This single observation undermines all their objections drawn from the fact that immersion is not always mentioned where *the name* of the Lord or *faith* is associated with forgiveness. Nor is grace, the blood of Christ, or faith always mentioned in connection with forgiveness. When they find a passage where remission of sins is referenced without immersion, it is weak or unjust to argue based on that, suggesting that forgiveness can be granted without immersion.  

***If their logic is worth anything, it will prove that a man may be forgiven without grace, the blood of Jesus, and without faith: for we can find many passages where remission, or justification, sanctification, or some similar term occurs without mentioning either grace, faith, or the blood of Jesus.*** 

As this is the crux, the essence, and the heart of all the logic employed by our most adept opponents on this subject, I wish I could emphasize it more forcefully than by printing it in capitals. I know some editors, some of our Doctors of Divinity, and some of our most learned speakers who make this argument, which we unreservedly call a genuine sophism, the Alpha and the Omega of their speeches against the meaning and indispensable importance of Christian immersion. 

The New Testament would have been an interesting book had every mention of *remission of sins* been preceded by *grace, faith, the blood of Jesus, immersion, etc.* But now the pressing question, which is emphatically relevant to rational individuals, is — **do they think, believe, teach, and practice more wisely and safely, those who assert that grace, faith, the blood of Jesus, the name of the Lord, and immersion are all essential for immediate pardon and acceptance; — or those who claim that faith alone, grace alone, the blood of Christ alone, and the name of the Lord alone — and immersion not at all**? To all men, women, and children of common sense, this question is submitted. 

It is, however, admirable to me that the remission of sins should be not merely unequivocally, but so repeatedly declared through *immersion* as it is in the apostolic writings. Here, I would ask the entire thinking community, one by one, whether, if the entire race of men had been assembled on Pentecost, or in Solomon's portico, and had asked Peter the same question posed by the convicted, would he, or would he not, have given them the same answer? Would he not have told all humanity to repent and be immersed for the remission of their sins? Or to repent and be *converted*, so their sins might be blotted out? — to rise and be immersed, and wash away their sins? If he would not, let them provide a reason; and if they assert he would, let them explain why they do not go and do likewise. 

Some have objected that the "seasons of refreshment," or the comforts of the Holy Spirit, occur after "conversion," or "regeneration," or "immersion"; (for when we speak scripturally, we must use these terms as all referring to the same thing,) because the gifts of the Holy Spirit were poured out upon the Gentiles before immersion. They overlook the intent of thus welcoming the Gentiles into the kingdom. They forget the comparison of the Gentiles to a returning prodigal, and his father going out to meet him while he was still a good distance away. God welcomed the first fruits of the Jews into his kingdom through a spectacular display of spiritual gifts, referred to as *the baptism of the Holy Spirit*, before any of the Jews had been immersed into the Lord Jesus. And, as Peter explains this matter in Cornelius's case, it seems that God intended to make no distinction between the Jews and Gentiles in receiving them into his kingdom. Hence, Peter claimed he gave them *the same gift* that he gave to us Jews *at the beginning* (never since Pentecost). Thus, Peter was authorized to command those Gentiles to be immersed by the authority of the Lord, no one daring to forbid it. However, these gifts of the Holy Spirit differed greatly from the seasons of refreshment, from the righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, which all those who were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of sins commonly enjoy.

It should be noted here, as pertinent to our current purpose, that as the Apostle Peter was interrupted by the baptism of the Holy Spirit when he began to speak of forgiveness through *the name* of the Lord Jesus; as soon as he saw the Lord had received them, he commanded them to be immersed by the authority of the Lord. And here I must pose another question to the learned and the unlearned: How comes it to pass that although it is commanded, once and only once, that the nations who believe should be immersed into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; and despite the lack of records of anyone being immersed into this name in that manner; I ask, how comes it to pass that all denominations use these words without hesitation and baptize or sprinkle in this name; when there are numerous commands and precedents for immersing for remission of sins, yet only a few proclaimers can be persuaded to immerse for remission of sins, despite such teaching and proclamations from the Apostles? Is one command, unsupported by a single precedent, enough to justify this practice of Christians; while numerous commands and precedents from the same authority are insufficient to allow or justify us in immersing for the remission of sins? Answer this, if you can; I cannot, except to say that tyrannical Custom, who provides no account for his actions, has so decreed. 

I now turn to another direct and positive testimony from the Apostles that demonstrates immersion for remission of sins is an institution of Jesus Christ. It is the address of Ananias to Saul: "Arise and be immersed and wash away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord." We have not yet discussed this testimony in this essay. It has been mentioned but not examined. 

Paul, like the hearers on Pentecost, when convinced of the truth of the Messiah’s claims, asked what *he* should do. He was instructed to go to Damascus, where it would be told to him what he should do. He was told in the words now before us. But some argue that this cannot be understood literally. 

For experiment, then, take it figuratively. Of what was it figurative? Of something already received? Of pardon previously granted? A figure of the past?! This is unusual. I find one writer, and only one, who interprets this as a *commemorative* baptism, similar to Israel commemorating the escape from Egypt, or Christians commemorating the Lord's death. And if I’m not mistaken, some preacher claimed it was a figurative expression similar to "*This is my body!*" One, whom I pressed out of all these escapes, was honest enough to say he really did not know what it meant; but it couldn’t mean that Paul was to be "baptized for the remission of his sins!" 

"To wash away sins" is a figurative expression. Like other metaphoric expressions, it places the resemblance in place of the proper word. It necessarily implies something akin to what is stated. However, we are said to be washed from our sins in, or by the blood of Christ. Yet even "*washed in blood*" is a metaphor and implies something similar to washing in water. Perhaps we can find another expression that reconciles these strong metaphors. Rev. 7:14 states, "They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." Here are two equally incomprehensible elements — to wash garments *white* in blood, and to *wash away* sins in water! An efficacy is attributed to water which it does not possess; and, likewise, an efficacy is attributed to blood which it also does not possess. If blood can *whiten* or cleanse garments, then surely water can *wash away* sins. There is, then, a transfer of the efficacy of blood to water; and a transfer of the efficacy of water to blood. This is a clear solution to the entire matter. God has transferred, in some way, the whitening efficacy, or cleansing power of water to blood; and the absolving or pardoning power of blood to water. This occurs on the same principle by which faith is accounted for righteousness. What a gracious institution! God has opened a fountain for sin, for moral pollution. He has extended it as far and wide as sin has spread — as far and wide as water flows. Wherever water, faith, and the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are present, there will be found the efficacy of the blood of Jesus. Yes, just as God first granted the efficacy of water to blood, he has now given the efficacy of blood to water. This is figurative, as mentioned; but it is not a metaphor that misleads, for the meaning is plainly stated without metaphor, viz. immersion for remission of sins. To the one who made the washing of clay from the eyes the means for cleansing blindness, it is possible to make the immersion of the body in water effective in washing away sin *from the conscience.* 

From the conscience, I assert; for that is where its malignity is felt; and it is only through releasing the conscience from guilt and its consequences — fear and shame — that we are freed from the dominion of sin or cleansed from its pollution in this world. Thus, immersion, says Peter, *saves* us, not by cleansing the body from its filth, but the conscience from its guilt; yes, immersion saves us by burying us with Christ, raising us with him, and thus our consciences are purified from dead works to serve the living God. Hence our Lord placed great importance on immersion in giving the commission to convert the world — "*He who believes and is immersed shall be saved.*" 

While we consider the water and blood as uniting their powers, as assuredly as Jesus came by water and blood, we ought to acknowledge another testimony asserting this gracious combination of powers, given by Paul the Apostle: "Being sprinkled in heart from an evil conscience, and being washed in body with clear water." 

The application of water, the cleansing element, to the body is made in this gracious institution to address the conscience, just as the blood of sprinkling did under the law. 

Some inquire, How can water, which does not penetrate the skin, reach the conscience? They boast of such an objection as showcasing great intellect and good sense. Yet they fail to realize that in so speaking, they deride and mock the entire Divine Economy, under the Old and New Institutions: for, I ask, did not the sacrifices and Jewish purifications somehow reach the conscience of that people!! If they did not, all of it was mere frivolity. And can eating bread and drinking wine not influence or touch the soul? Can a *breath* from one individual pierce the heart of another, stirring his blood to the point of making his head a fountain of tears? He who objects to water and the importance of immersion objects to the entire remedial institution, as taught by Moses and Christ, and insults the wisdom and goodness of God throughout the entire scheme of salvation. Furthermore, he who objects to water, because it can only remove the filth of the flesh, ought rather to object to blood; since it more likely smears and pollutes than it cleanses the body, and cannot touch the soul. But all such reasoners are foolish talkers. Submitting to God's institution is our wisdom and happiness. The experiences of the countless individuals who have been immersed for the remission of their sins, as detailed in the Christian scriptures, not to mention those immersed in modern times, are worth more than volumes of arguments from the lips and pens of those who can only regard and venerate the traditions of their fathers; presuming their fathers were wiser and better judges than their offspring. 

However, as it is not our intent to quote and elaborate on all the sacred testimonies, both direct and allusive, concerning immersion for the remission of sins, we shall conclude the proof and illustration of this proposition with an incidental reference to the cleansing efficacy of this institution found in the 2nd Epistle of Peter. After enumerating the additions to faith necessary to secure our calling and election, of which *courage* is mentioned first, and charity, or universal love, as the last; the Apostle states that "he who lacks these qualities is blind, shutting his eyes, and forgetting that he was *purified from his old sins.*" I need not state here that this is, perhaps (and certainly as far as I know), universally understood as referring to Christian immersion. The  "*old sins,*" or  "*former sins,*" can, we presume, only mean those washed away in immersion. No one has attempted to demonstrate that these words can imply anything else. It stands as one of the clearest, and, because it is incidental, one of the most decisive proofs that, in Peter's view, all previous sins were forgiven in immersion. We began our proof of this position with Peter, and we will conclude it similarly. He first proclaimed reformation for the remission of sins; and in his final letters to the Christian communities, he reminds them of that purification from sin, received in and through immersion; and in the strongest terms cautions them against forgetting that they were thus purified. 

If anyone were to reason based on the simple import of the action commanded by Jesus, I believe it could be shown from the action itself, in its two parts, *the burial and the resurrection,* that it must correlate with everything we have heard the Apostles attribute to it. Corruption goes literally down into the grave; but does corruption come forth from it? Does not the state change in the grave? Who expects to emerge from the grave in the same state in which he descended? The firstborn from the dead did not; nor shall any of them who sleep in him. How then can it be that any person buried with Christ in immersion can rise with Christ and not rise in a new state!! Surely the Apostle urges for a new life based on the change of state affected in immersion. "Since, indeed, you have risen with Christ, set your affections on things above." Walk in a new life. 

Again, and lastly here — Is a child in the same state after its birth as it was before? Is not its state changed? And does it not lead a new life in comparison to its former way of living? Like newborn infants, desiring the unadulterated milk of the Word, so let the newly regenerate desire the unadulterated milk of the Word for growth. Call immersion, therefore, a new birth, a washing of regeneration, or a resurrection, and its meaning remains the same. And when so identified, it must imply that change of state signified in putting on Christ, in being pardoned, justified, sanctified, adopted, reconciled, and saved, which was the main proposition to be proved and illustrated, and which we believe has been proved and illustrated by the preceding testimonies and reflections. 

Though no article of Christian faith, nor item of Christian practice, can legitimately rest upon any testimony, reasoning, or authority outside the sacred writings of the Apostles, even if it were only one day after their death; yet the views and practices of contemporaries, or the pupils of the Apostles and their immediate successors may be highlighted as corroborating evidence of the truths taught, and the practices enjoined by the Apostles; and, as such, may be cited— all while remembering that where the testimony of Apostles ends, Christian faith necessarily concludes. After this preliminary remark, I proceed to support the following proposition: —

# A WORD TO FRIENDLY ALIENS

Whether to regard you as *Proselytes of the Gate*, who refused circumcision but wished to live in the land of Israel, to be in the suburbs of the cities of Judah, and to keep some of the institutions of the ancient kingdom of God, without becoming fellow citizens of that kingdom; or whether to consider you as the Samaritans of old, who built a temple of God upon Mount Gerizim, held fast a part of the ancient revelation of God, and rejected only those parts that did not suit their prejudices — worshipped the God of Israel alongside the idols of the nations from which they came — I say, whether to regard you in light of one or the other of those ancient practitioners of religion might require more skill in reasoning than we possess — more leisure than we have at our disposal — and more effort than either of us has the patience to endure. One thing, however, is clear: if, under the Reign of Heaven, it was necessary for such a good man as Cornelius (*a man of piety, who feared God with all his household, gave much alms to the people, and prayed constantly to God*) to '*hear words by which he might be saved,*' and to put on Christ by being immersed into his death, so that he might enter the kingdom of heaven, enjoy the remission of sins, and have hope of an inheritance among all the sanctified — certainly, it is both expedient and necessary that you also go and do likewise.

Every sectarian in the land, no matter how honest and pious, should bury his sectarianism, along with all his other sins of omission and commission, in 'the bath of regeneration.' It is a serious crime for anyone, professing to have received the Messiah in his proper person, character, and office, to refuse allegiance to him in anything; and to substitute human inventions and traditions in place of the ordinances and statutes of Prince Immanuel. Indeed, maintaining any doctrine, practice, or custom that directly or indirectly undermines the constitution, laws, and usages of the kingdom over which Jesus presides is directly opposed to his governance; and would ultimately result in dethroning him in favor of a rival, placing upon his throne the author of that doctrine, practice, or usage that replaces the institution of the Savior of the world.

Thus, to you who, in the name of the King, are changing his ordinances and substituting your own solutions for the wisdom and authority of the Judge of all, we now propose the following considerations: —

Every kingdom has one uniform law or institution for naturalizing aliens; and that institution, regardless of its nature, is obligatory, by the authority of the government, on everyone who wishes to become a citizen. We state that it is obligatory for anyone seeking citizenship to submit to that institution. But does not your practice and your doctrine explicitly state that it is not the duty of an alien to be born again, but the duty of his father or guardian to have him naturalized? Now, although many responsibilities are shared among brother, father, and child, those duties that belong specifically to a father cannot be the responsibility of his child, in religion, morality, or society. If it is the father's duty to ‘offer his child to the Lord,’ to speak in your own terms, it is not the child’s duty to offer himself. It was not Isaac's duty to be circumcised, but Abraham's duty to circumcise him. Thus, if it was your father's duty to have made you citizens of the kingdom of heaven, it is not your duty to become citizens, unless you can produce a law stating that in *all cases* where the father fails to do his duty, then it falls on the child to fulfill what his father neglected.

Further — if all fathers, like yours, had, on their own authority, without any command from the Lord, baptized their children, there would not be a single person in a nation to whom it could be said, 'Repent and be baptized;' much less could it be said to every penitent, 'Be baptized, each one of you, by the authority of the Lord, for the remission of sins.' These remarks aim simply to show that your institutions do, in truth, undermine the government of Christ, leading to the complete abolition of his kingdom's institutions. For this reason alone, and no other, you ought to be constitutionally naturalized and legally and honorably inducted into the kingdom of heaven. It is a solemn duty you owe to the King and his government; and if you have a conscience shaped by the oracles of God, you cannot have confidence in God, nor true peace of mind, as long as you support, endorse, exemplify, and entirely influence the breakdown of the institutions of Jesus Christ, the opening of his kingdom to all that is born of the flesh, and the prevention, as far as you can, of every person from the pleasure of choosing whom he will obey — of confessing him before men — of taking his yoke — of dying, being buried, and rising with Christ in his gracious institution. If Jesus himself, to fulfill all righteousness or to honor every divine institution, even though he needed not the reformation for remission of sins that John preached, was immersed by John — what do you have to say for yourselves — you who would claim the honors and privileges of the kingdom of heaven, yet refuse to follow the example of Jesus and who, by supporting a system that would, if fully implemented, prevent a voluntary agent in the race of Adam from doing that which all the first converts of Christ did, by virtue of the commission which Jesus gave to his Apostles?

Again — whatever confidence you may currently have that you are good citizens of the kingdom of Messiah, that confidence is not based on a "**thus saith the lord**," but on your own reasoning, which all men must recognize may be, as in many other matters, fallacious. Jesus stated, 'He who believes and is immersed shall be saved;' and Peter commanded every penitent to be immersed for the remission of his sins. Now, he who hears the word, believes it, and is immersed on his own confession, has an assurance, a confidence, which is impossible for you to have.

Let me add just one more consideration, for we are not currently debating the merits of your theory, or that of any party: it is your duty, as you seek the unity of (what you call) the church and the conversion of the world, to be immersed and to be born constitutionally into the kingdom; because all Protestants, of every name, if sincere believers in Jesus *as the Christ,* regardless of every opinion found in any human creed, could if they wished, honor and obey his institutions, come into one fold, and sit together under the reign of the Messiah. If all would follow your example, this would necessarily happen; if they do not, you have done your duty. In being immersed in this way, the whole world, Catholic and Protestant, agrees that you are truly and scripturally baptized; for all assert that an *immersed* penitent is constitutionally baptized into Christ; but only a part of the professing world can acknowledge the rite of infant affusion on which you rely as introducing you, without prior knowledge, faith, or repentance, into the family of God. Thus, clear your conscience; follow the example of Jesus; honor and uphold his authority; promote the unity and peace of the family of God; do what you can for the conversion of the world; enter into the full enjoyment of the blessings of the kingdom of heaven by confessing the ancient faith and by being immersed in the name of Jesus, into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, for the remission of sins. Then you may say, as Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, although the Samaritans have a temple on Mount Gerizim, a priesthood, and the five books of Moses, 'Salvation is of the Jews.' Although the sects have the Oracles of God, human creeds, many altars, priests, and religious customs, *the enjoyment of salvation* is among those who simply believe what the Apostles wrote concerning Jesus, and who from the heart obey that mold of doctrine which the Apostles delivered to us.

In doing so, you will also wisely consider your own safety and security from the significant calamities that are accumulating every day and are soon to fall with overwhelming force on a distracted, divided, alienated, and corrupt generation. If you are '*the people of God,*' as you profess and as we hope to believe, then you are commanded by a voice from heaven, 'Come out of her, *my people,* that you do not partake of the sins of mystic Babylon, and that you do not receive a portion of her plagues.' If affliction, shame, poverty, and reproach were to be the unavoidable fate of the most approved servants of God, it is much better, infinitely better for you to suffer with them than to enjoy for a season all that a corrupted and apostate society can offer. Remember who it is that has said, 'Blessed are they who keep his commandments, for they shall have a right to the tree of life, and they shall enter in through the gates into the city!'

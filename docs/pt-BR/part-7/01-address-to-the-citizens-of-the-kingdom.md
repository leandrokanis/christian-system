# Address to the Citizens of the Kingdom

Dear Citizens,

Your status and place in the reign of the Prince of Peace have never been surpassed—indeed, they have never been equaled by any part of humanity. You have visions and revelations of God—His being and perfections—insights into the depths of His wisdom and knowledge, the workings of His grace, and the intentions of His love, which grant you an intellectual and moral superiority over all those who came before you in the Patriarchal and Jewish eras. Secrets of God, hidden from ages and generations, have been revealed to you by the Apostles of the Great Apostle and High Priest of your faith. What Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, David, Isaiah, Daniel, and all the Prophets, up to John the Baptist, longed to foresee, you have realized and experienced. The intellectual joys of the highest and most sublime understandings of God and of Christ bestowed upon you far surpass the achievements of the ancient people of God, elevating you to a heavenly plane and allowing you to enjoy the days of heaven on earth. You possess a book that contains not only the charter of your privileges but also explains countless mysteries in God's prior dealings with all nations on earth. In it, you find interpretations of God's past providences in the lives of individuals, families, and nations that open up myriad sources of rational and emotional enjoyment from events and things that baffled and confused even the most intelligent and favored individuals of past eras. Mountains are, indeed, leveled; valleys are raised; rough places are made smooth, and crooked paths straightened in your understanding; and, based on these insights, you can form more accurate perceptions of the present and more profound expectations for the future than those who were the most favored in earlier times. Truly, the vast and rich depths of knowledge found in Christian revelations are so boundless that even the most comprehensive mind in the kingdom of heaven could explore them throughout a lifetime, continually enriching itself with all knowledge and spiritual understanding, yet still leave vast regions of thought entirely uncharted.

This marked superiority over the most gifted saints of former ages is something you undoubtedly possess. Among all the living excellencies with which they were familiar, they lacked a perfect model of all human excellence. As bright as the virtues and excellencies of an Abraham, a Joseph, or a David were, there were flaws, or at least some imperfections in their moral character. They could not present, in living form to their contemporaries or leave as a legacy for future generations, every virtue, grace, and excellence that embellishes human nature. But you have Jesus, not only as "the image of the invisible God," "the radiance of His glory, and the exact representation of His character;" but as a man, holy, innocent, pure, separate from sin, demonstrating in perfect fullness every quality that confers beauty, dignity, and honor to human character. You have motivations for purity and holiness, an encouragement towards all that is noble, good, and excellent from what He said, did, and experienced as the Son of Man, which would have added new charms and virtues to the most exemplary saints of antiquity.

You are richly endowed with opportunities for the highest intellectual and moral enjoyment, for which they sighed in vain: God has provided better things for Christians than for Jews and Patriarchs. Shall we not, then, dear citizens, appreciate and utilize, as we ought, the light that the Sun of Righteousness has so richly and abundantly shed upon us for our present purity and happiness, and for our eternal honor and glory? Remember that we stand upon the shoulders of Apostles and Prophets, sustained by Jesus, the light of the world, who interprets and validates all of God's dealings with humanity in creation, providence, and redemption. All suns are stars; and He who is now to us in this life "*the Sun of Righteousness,*" will be "*the Bright and Morning Star*" in respect to the future. Until the day of eternity dawns, and the day-star of immortality arises in our hearts, let us always look to Jesus.

But it is not only the joy of superior heavenly light, though that is truly delightful to our rational nature, that distinguishes you as citizens of this kingdom; it is also that personal, real, and complete remission of all sin that you enjoy through the blood of the Lamb of God, given to you through the rites of Christian baptism and confession of sins.

The Jews, indeed, had sacrifices under the law that could and did remove ceremonial sins; they were sufficient to absolve guilt from breaching that law, allowing them to continue enjoying the temporal and political promises of the national covenant; but the Jewish sacrifices and ablutions could not reach beyond that. Every Jew benefitted from them. However, regarding the conscience, Paul, that great commentator on Jewish sacrifice, assures us they had no power. "Concerning the conscience," he states, "they could not make perfect the one who performed the service."

The introduction of the law brought the knowledge of sin. It named particular sins and "caused the transgression to abound." The sacrifices associated with it pertained solely to that institution, and not to sin in general or to sin in its true and proper nature. The promise made to the patriarchs and the sacrificial institution that accompanied it, through faith in that promise, led believers to anticipate a genuine sin-offering; but it appears the Jewish sacrifices only addressed the Jewish institution and, apart from their typological character, shed no new light for those under that system on the subject of a true and *proper* remission of sins through the genuine and bloody sacrifice of Christ.

The Patriarch and the believing Jew, in terms of actual remission of sins, stood on the same ground; for, as noted earlier, the legal institution, or, as Paul says, "the arrival of the law," made no change in the understanding of remission regarding the conscience. But a new age has arrived (for "these ordinances for cleansing the flesh were imposed only until the time of reformation"), and Christ has, through a more perfect sacrifice, opened the way into the true holy places, laying the foundation for perfecting the conscience through a real and full remission of sins, which, by the virtue of His blood, extends not to the flesh, but to the sinner's conscience.

John, indeed, who lived at the dawn of the Reformation, preached a reformation with baptism for the remission of sins; proclaiming that "they should believe in Him who was to come after him." Those who believed John's gospel, repented, and were baptized into John's reform experienced remission of sins through faith in Him who was to come; but you, fellow citizens, enjoy a significantly greater understanding of remission compared to John’s disciples. You have been baptized not only under the authority of Jesus, *as Lord of all,* into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, but also *into the death* or sacrifice of Christ. This knowledge was unknown to the disciples of Moses or John. This gives you insight into sin and freedom from it, *in terms of conscience*—a peace and joy that is inexpressible and full of glory, to which both the disciples of Moses and the Baptist were strangers. So the light of the risen day of heaven's eternal Sun greatly outshines not only the glimmers of the stars of the patriarchal age and the faint light of the moon of the Jewish age, but even the twilight of the early morning.

Your new relationship with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into which you have been brought by faith in the Messiah and baptism into His death, affirms, regarding the sense and confidence of remission, all that John and Jesus stated about the superiority of the privileges granted to the citizens of the kingdom of heaven. You can see your sins washed away in the blood that was shed on Mount Calvary. That which neither the highly favored John nor any disciple of the Messiah could comprehend until Jesus declared, "*It is finished,*" you not only understand clearly but have wholeheartedly accepted. You can confidently proclaim that "the blood of Jesus Christ now cleanses you from all sin;" and that through faith you have access to the Mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that brings glad tidings to your heart. You have an Advocate with the Father; and when aware of any impurity, approaching Him with prayer, confessing your sins, and seeking pardon through His blood, you have the promise of remission. You now understand how God is *just* as well as merciful in forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin.

But superior light and knowledge, along with an expanded understanding of God, coupled with such assurance of real and personal remission that calms the conscience and brings the peace of God to the heart, are not the only distinguishing blessings you enjoy through your new relationship with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; you have been formally *adopted* *into the family of God* and declared sons and daughters of the Almighty Father.

To be called "*the friend of God*" was the highest honor bestowed upon Abraham; to be called friends of Christ was the special privilege of the disciples of Christ, whom He entrusted with the secrets of His kingdom; but to be called "children of God through faith in Jesus Christ" is not only the common honor of all Christians, but the greatest honor that could be granted to the inhabitants of this earth. Such honor is yours, my fellow citizens, to be related to the only-begotten Son of God: "For as many as received Him, He gave the right to become the children of God." These individuals were not born into noble families or renowned lineages; they are not born from the flesh's instincts, nor made the children of God "by the will of man," who sometimes adopts the child of another as his own; but they are "born of God" through the ordinances of His grace. "Behold what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!" "The world, indeed, does not know us because it did not know Him. Dear friends, now we are the children of God. It has not yet been made clear what we shall be."

"Because you are sons, God has sent the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, Abba, Father." And if you are sons, it follows that you "are heirs of God through Christ"—the heir of all things. Is this, dear citizens, a fanciful vision, or sober and solemn truth, that you are children of God, possessing the spirit of Christ, and declared heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ in the eternal inheritance? What kind of people, then, ought you to be! How pure, how holy and heavenly in spirit; how just and righteous in all your actions; how humble and devoted to the Lord; how joyful and triumphant in your King!

Permit me to ask, Where do you excel?—no, rather, let this question arise within yourselves. You will ask, How shall we further promote the interests, honor, and victories of the gospel of the kingdom? Is there anything we can do through our behavior, our morality, our piety, our influence, or all the earthly means God has provided us? Is there anything more we can do to strengthen the army of faith, invigorate the champions of the kingdom, or make new conquests for our King? Can we not increase the joy of the Lord by converting souls—can we not provide moments of rejoicing for the angels of God—can we not bring joy to the hearts of thousands who have never experienced the joys of being children of God?

In the current administration of God’s kingdom, during the absence of the King, He has commanded the citizens, "Put on the armor of light"—"Contend earnestly for the faith"—"Convert the world"—"Occupy until I come"—"Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven"—"That the Gentiles may glorify God on the day of visitation through your good works which they observe." He has entrusted to the citizens the great task for which He died—the salvation of humanity. Let us, then, brethren, be found faithful to the Lord and to humanity, so that He may address us at His coming with the most pleasing commendation: "Well done, good and faithful servants; enter into the joy of your Lord!"

Despite the significant opposition to truth and salvation, we have no reason to despair. Our friends and allies are greater and infinitely more powerful than all our enemies. God is on our side—Jesus Christ is our King—the Holy Spirit is at His service—angels are His ministering servants— the prayers of all the prophets, apostles, saints, and martyrs are aimed at our success—our companions are many and strong—they possess the Sword of the Spirit, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, the breastplate of righteousness, the artillery of truth, the arguments of God, and the preparation of the gospel of peace—our Commander and Captain is the most successful General to ever enter the battlefield—He has never lost a battle—He is wonderful in counsel, excellent in action, and valiant in battle—the Lord of *hosts* is His name. He can thwart the machinations of our foes, control all the powers of nature, and subdue all our earthly and infernal enemies. Under His guidance, we are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken. Indeed, under Him we have come to Mount Zion, the stronghold and fortress of the kingdom, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless angels, the gathering of the firstborn enrolled in heaven—to God, the Judge of all—to the spirits of righteous men made perfect—to Jesus, the Mediator of the New Covenant—and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks peace, joy, and courage to the heart. Should we not, then, brethren, "be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might?" If in faith, courage, and prayer we don the heavenly armor and march under the King, sounding the gospel trumpet, the walls of Jericho will crumble, and the banners of the Cross will wave over the ruins of Paganism, Atheism, Skepticism, and sectarianism— *Nil desperandum, te duce, Christe.* If a Roman could say, "Nothing should be feared under the watchful eye of Caesar," may the Christian declare, "There is no despair under the guardianship of Messiah the King?"

However, fellow citizens, though clothed with the full armor of heaven and led by the Captain of Salvation, success in this war cannot be expected without constant and unwavering prayer. When the Apostles started to build this kingdom, despite the gifts they received, they found it essential to devote themselves to prayer as well as to the ministry of the word. And when Paul describes the armor of God, piece by piece, he states, "Take the Sword of the Spirit"—with all supplication and petition, pray at all times in the Spirit, watching with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints."

This was most vividly depicted in the warfare of ancient Israel against their enemies. While Moses held up his holy hands to heaven, Israel prevailed; and when he did not, Amalek prevailed. It is the same now. When Christ’s disciples, the heaven-born citizens of the kingdom, remain steadfast in prayer and vigilance, truth triumphs in their hearts and in the world. When they do not, they become cold, timid, and powerless like a shorn Samson, allowing the enemy to gain strength over them. Then the cause of the Lord languishes.

It is unnecessary for us to understand how prayer enhances our zeal, wisdom, strength, or joy, or how it contributes to the cause's success, any more than it is necessary to comprehend how our food transforms into flesh, blood, and bone. It suffices that we eat; and it suffices that we pray as instructed and commanded. Experience shows that the outer person is renewed daily by our daily bread, and experience shows that the inner self is renewed daily through prayer and gratitude. The Lord has promised His Holy Spirit to those who ask Him in truth; and is it not necessary for our success? If it may not be necessary to provide new revelations, it is necessary to keep in mind those already given and to bring the written word to our remembrance when needed. Moreover, if the Spirit of the Lord was essential for the successes of Gideon and Barak, and Samson and David, and all the great warriors of Israel according to the flesh who fought the Lord's battles with the sword, sling, and bow; who can assert that it is not essential for those of us who take up the Sword of the Spirit and fight the good fight of faith? In my view, it is just as necessary now as it was then—necessary for equal success—necessary for those laboring in the word and teaching, and necessary for those who strive to perform their duties well in every role within the ranks of the great army of the Lord of hosts.

Though our weapons of warfare are not carnal, but spiritual, they are powerful (only, however, *through God,* for tearing down strongholds) for demolishing all arguments against the truth and every high thing that sets itself against the knowledge of God, and for taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ. So let us, fellow citizens, whether as leaders or as ordinary soldiers, abound in prayer and supplication to God day and night. If sincere, fervent, and constant prayers to God for everything He has promised—from all things for which the Apostles prayed that were also offered by all congregations and every disciple in his family and in his private time for the triumphs of the truth—then we would witness the army of the Lord being victorious in battle against atheism, infidelity, and sectarianism—then we would see disciples growing in both knowledge and favor with God and man. And is not the conversion of the world and our own eternal salvation infinitely worthy of all effort and enterprise on the part of humanity, seeing that God Himself has done so much in the gift of His Son and Holy Spirit, leaving so little for us to do—nothing, in fact, but what lies within our capacity? And will we withhold that little, especially since He has granted us so many exceedingly great and precious promises to encourage us to take action? Has not Jesus stated, "The conqueror shall inherit all things"—that He "will not erase his name from the book of life"—that He will confess it before His Father and His holy angels—that He will place him "upon His throne and grant him the crown of life that shall never fade away"?

Rise up, then, in the strength of Judah’s Lion! Be valiant for the truth! Clothe yourselves with all the graces of the Spirit of God! Put on the armor of light: and, with all the gentleness, meekness, and calmness embodied in Christ—with all the courage, patience, zeal, and dedication befitting a cause so beneficial, pure, holy, and divine, resolve never to waver or falter until you enter the pearly gates—never to lower your arms, until, with the triumphant millions, you stand before the throne and exultantly sing, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, riches, wisdom, might, honor, glory, and blessing!"—"To Him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb be blessing, honor, glory, and strength forever and ever!" Amen.

# 3. The Kingdom of Heaven 

And why, an *American* might ask, is it not called the *Republic* of Heaven, and the Ruler called the *President* of a Celestial Republic? Certainly, there were the Republics of Greece and Rome before the doctrine of this Kingdom was first proclaimed, and both Gentiles and Jews could have understood the concept of a Republic just as easily as that of a Kingdom. It was not, then, because there was no model or type of this sort in society; rather, it was because such a type would have been unsuitable to the nature of this institution. 

History shows that Republics are better suited for peace than war, and that they are forced and unnatural organizations of society. Aristocracies and Republics owe all their appeal to the excessive corruption of the governments from which they arose. They are a reaction against force and deceit, cruelty and oppression, and are sustained by the memory and fear of the evils that created them. They have often been praised or admired either by contrasting them with the vices and enormities of degenerate and licentious monarchies, or by recalling the wrongs and outrages that brought them into being; and people have generally grown weary of them when they became corrupt and forgetful of the oppressions and crimes that caused their formation. Therefore, the corruptions of monarchies have given rise to Republics, and the corruptions of these have led to monarchies once again. 

In these final days of decline, Republics are great blessings to humanity, like good doctors in times of plague; yet it must be acknowledged that it would be an even greater blessing to be without plagues and doctors. While humanity remains in its current degeneration, and while selfishness and injustice are rampant in society, republican officials are preferable to kings — because we can remove them more easily. They are, in fact, kings by another name, with a short lease on authority; and our experience clearly shows that in these declining times, the reigns of our republican kings are nearly too long. Until the King of kings arrives, we Christians ought to be good republicans, believing that human governments rarely improve, and that the popular doctrine of our country is true — that political authority generally makes a person worse, and public favors almost invariably corrupt the heart. Rapid rotation in office is the practical effect of the republican theory; and the experience shows that, however brief republican authority is, it can sometimes last too long for republican virtue to endure without deterioration. Now if this is true of republican virtue, which is the brightest and best, what earthly virtue can withstand the corruption of prolonged authority? 

Monarchy is the only form of government that nature recognizes. It was the first and will be the last. A government with three or thirty leaders is a monster; hence the beast that symbolizes it emerges from the sea with multiple horns as well as heads. 

The most accepted theory of human nature and governance today, wherever the English language is spoken, whether in the Old World or the New, is that a monarchy is always the best form of government, because it is the cheapest, most efficient, and most dignified; as long as the crown is placed on the wisest head and the scepter wielded by the purest hands. If we could always ensure this, we would be monarchists; because we cannot, we are all republicans. 

But, after this defense of the term *Kingdom of Heaven,* we would bring the reader's attention back to the concession made by republicans themselves, that a kingdom is better suited for a state of war than a republic; and the beautiful, though most fitting figure, which appears in the New Testament over one hundred fifty times, and often in the Old, presupposes a state of war existing in the universe. For the reasons given in favor of a monarchy, the *natural* government of the universe has always been, is, and will forever be monarchy. God himself is necessarily the absolute monarch of the universe. Had he not essentially maintained that relationship to all his creatures, rebellion and sin could never have occurred in his realm. The systems of nature all follow this model. Every sun is a king over the system it governs; and within every sphere, there is one controlling and supreme principle. It will be the final government; for when the episode in the great drama of *rational* existence caused by sin has concluded, the government of the universe will restore its ancient order, and God will again be the supreme monarch. But this will not happen until Jesus hands the kingdom back to God, which an unnatural state of affairs placed in his hands. This cannot occur until he has brought humanity into their rightful allegiance, or forever destroyed every opponent to the absolute monarchy of the Eternal Supreme: "for Jesus must reign until all his enemies are placed under his feet." 

The kingdom that Jesus has received from his Father, however heavenly, sublime, and glorious it may be considered, is only temporal. It had a beginning, and it will have an end; for he must reign only *until* all enemies are put under his feet. But the transfer of the scepter into the hands of Emmanuel has not changed the government. He is now the hereditary Monarch of the universe, as well as the rightful King of his own kingdom. He now reigns over all principalities, hierarchs, and powers, celestial and terrestrial, as absolutely as did the great God and Father of the universe before he was invested with regal authority. 

We have said that it was an unnatural state of affairs that originated the kingdom of Jesus; therefore, the aim of this remedial reign is to abolish that unnatural state — to eradicate sin. Now, as all human governments presuppose disorder, and as the kingdoms of this world generally arise from confusion and war, the kingdom of heaven, which we are discussing, owes its origin to the celestial and terrestrial apostasies — the revolt of Satan and of Adam. Were there no justice within, or violence without, civil government would be entirely unnecessary, and its components an excrescence upon society. Had there not been such a revolt and rebellion as sacred history records, there would have been no such kingdom of heaven as that over which Jesus the Messiah now presides. Now, as both this King and kingdom, along with all that pertains to them, originated from such an unnatural state of affairs, we must examine them in all their attributes and details in relation to those circumstances that brought them into existence.

***The Elements of a Kingdom***

We must understand the type, or we cannot grasp the antitype. We must comprehend that which is natural before we can understand that which is spiritual. Then, what are the essential elements of a kingdom as it exists among men? They are five: King, Constitution, Subjects, Laws, and Territory. Such are the essential components of every political kingdom, perfect in its kind, now existing on earth. 

In *forming a state,* the essential elements are people and territory. The people create a constitution, and this establishes a President or King, citizens or subjects, and all else belonging to a state. It is, then, the relationship into which the people choose to enter that makes it a republic, an aristocracy, or a monarchy. Do they opt for a monarchy? They first create a constitution, and this appoints one to the throne — makes them subjects, and then provides them with laws. Although the constitution is primary in the order of nature, of all the elements of a kingdom, for it designates one man as king and the others as subjects; yet we cannot conceive of a constitution in relation to a kingdom without a king and subjects. In discussing them in detail, we cannot, therefore, speak of any one of them as existing without the others — we must see them as correlates, coming into existence simultaneously. There is no husband or wife before marriage, nor can there be a husband without a wife; yet one of the parties must exist prior to the other. Marriage creates a husband from a bridegroom, and a wife from the bride. Similarly, the constitution makes the king or governor; the citizens or subjects, depending on the situation; for there can never be a king or subject without a constitution, or, in other words, an agreement, verbal or written, for certain privileges stipulated and conditioned. In every well-regulated political kingdom, *in the order of nature,* the elements stand thus: 1. Constitution; 2. King; 3. Subjects; 4. Laws; 5. Territory. 

In the kingdom which God set up through Moses, the elements were arranged in this order. The constitution was first proposed under which God agreed to be their King, and they were to be seen as his people or subjects; he then gave them laws and established them in the promised territory. 

However, in the kingdom of nature, or in the original kingdom of God, the elements are only four, and the order in which they stand is: 1. King; 2. Subjects; 3. Laws; 4. Territory. As Father and Creator of the kingdom, God himself was the absolute Sovereign, whose will is the supreme law of the entire realm of nature. 

Having established the essential elements of a *kingdom,* and noted the order in which they stand, before we particularly focus on those elements in that order, we shall ask, why is this kingdom called the kingdom of *Heaven?* 

***The Name***

Heaven and the Kingdom of Heaven are not the same thing. God is not the Kingdom of God. But just as the kingdom of God pertains to God, the Kingdom of Heaven pertains to heaven, and consequently to God. Whether the phrases "the Kingdom of God" and "the Kingdom of Heaven" always represent the same thing is debatable; however, it is clear that both phrases are often applied to the same institution.

This is true whether translated as *reign* or *kingdom*; and it is quite evident that in many instances, the original word *basileia* should preferably be translated as *reign,* as this term better suits those passages where *coming* or *approaching* is mentioned: for while reigns or administrations approach and recede, kingdoms have qualities and boundaries that are fixed. The reign and Kingdom of God, while sometimes applicable to the same subject, do not consider it from the same perspective. They are as closely connected as the reign of King William and the kingdom of Great Britain. The former represents the administration of the kingdom, and the latter the state over which this administration extends. 

Two good reasons can be offered as to why Matthew, the oldest Christian writer, generally prefers the phrase Kingdom or Reign of *Heaven* over the phrase Kingdom or Reign of *God:* I say *generally,* for he does occasionally use *both* terms. He wrote to Jews in Judea who anticipated a Messiah, a King, and a Kingdom of God on *earth,* a mere enhancement of the Jewish system; and therefore, to elevate their perception, he prefers to call it the Reign or Kingdom of *Heaven*, contrasting it with the earthly Kingdom of God, of which they had long been in possession. 

He also found a good reason in the usage of the Jewish prophets for employing the word *Heaven* (both in singular and plural forms) to refer to *God.* Daniel told the Assyrian monarch that his kingdom would be assured to him once he learned that "the *Heavens* do rule"; yet in the preceding verse, he states, "Till you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of man," — thus using *Heavens* and *the Most High* synonymously. The Psalmist declares, "The wicked set their mouths against the *Heavens.*" The Prodigal admits that he had "sinned against *Heaven,*" and Jesus himself asked whether John’s baptism was "from *Heaven* or from men." Thus he was justified from the Jewish usage of the word to consider it equivalent to *God.* If, then, Matthew intended nothing more by the phrase "Kingdom of Heaven" and "Kingdom of God," he was justified by the Jewish understanding of the word *heaven* to apply it in that sense. Some may argue against these observations regarding Matthew's usage, claiming that it was Jesus Christ and the preachers he commissioned who called it the Kingdom of Heaven, not Matthew Levi. To this, we respond that the other sacred writers, when recounting the same parables and incidents, uniformly use the phrase "Kingdom of God," and *never* use the phrase "the Kingdom of Heaven." 

From the usage of the phrase "Kingdom of God," I suggest that we regard him as specifically referring to the reason first stated. He does not say the Kingdom of *Heaven* shall be taken from the Jews; but "The Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation producing its fruits:" for although it might have been appropriate, in his understanding, to assert that the Jews already had the kingdom of God, it could not be said that they had the kingdom of *Heaven* as declared by Matt. 15:1-39. 

When compared with the earthly Kingdom of God among the Jews, it is certainly the Kingdom of *Heaven*; for Jesus asserts that his kingdom is not of this world; and Daniel affirmed that in the days of the final worldly empire, the God of heaven would establish a kingdom unlike all others happening on earth; in which, as Paul teaches, men are "blessed with every spiritual blessing in heavenly places in Christ;" for he has raised us Jews and Gentiles, and "has set us down together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus." 

There is, in the superior and heavenly privileges and honors bestowed upon the citizens of this kingdom, the best reason why it should have first been introduced to the world under this title, rather than any other; and for the same reasons that motivated Matthew to present it in Judea under this designation, we ought now to prefer it, because many of our contemporaries, like the ancient Jews, perceive as much of heaven and glory in the veiled grace of the Mosaic institution as in the unveiled grace of the Christian kingdom. The pertinence of this title will become even more evident as we develop the constitutional privileges of this kingdom. 

Yet, most evidently, the Kingdom of Heaven is "*the Kingdom of Christ and of God.*" It is the kingdom of God because he established it, provided the constitution and King, and all the materials out of which it is built. It is the kingdom of Christ because God the Father granted it to him as his Son, the *heir of all things,* and therefore, "all that is the Father's is mine," says Jesus, "and I am his." *God created all things by Jesus Christ and for him.* 

Having, then, discussed the reasons for the characteristic *titles* of this kingdom, and having already identified the elements that are absolutely essential to a kingdom, as distinguished from those merely circumstantial or accidental, we shall now proceed to consider in the order suggested, the Constitution, King, Subjects, Laws, and Territory of the Kingdom of Heaven. 

***Constitution*** 

God himself, after the gracious counsel of his own will, proposed and offered the constitution of this kingdom to his own Son. This "glory he had with the Father before the world was." He who was "in the beginning with God" — "*the wisdom and power of God*" — was set up from everlasting, before the earth existed. "Then was I with God, as one brought up with him; I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him — rejoicing in the inhabited parts of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men."

Therefore, he who was to be "*ruler in Israel*" was with God in counsel "at the beginning of all his ways;" for "his goings forth were from of old, even from the day of eternity."

It was **to do the will**, or fulfill the items of this constitution, that "*the* **Word** was made flesh and dwelt among us." I came to *do the will* of him that *sent* me, and to finish "the work *given* me to do." "I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it up again; this commandment I received from my Father." The Father "commissioned and sent him forth into the world." He "came down from heaven." "You have given me authority over all flesh, that I might give eternal life to all that you have given me." 

These and many other passages, which the reader will easily recall, clearly show that an understanding and agreement existed before time began between God and the **Word** of God — or, as now revealed, between the **Father** and the **Son**, regarding the kingdom. Because of this, "the *Word* was made flesh and dwelt among us" — as a consequence of which "he divested himself" of his former glory — "took upon himself the form of a servant" — "was made in the likeness of sinful flesh" — "took part with us in flesh and blood." Because of this agreement, and the promised glory, for "the joy set before him in the promise," of "seeing his offspring the travail of his soul and being satisfied," he "endured the cross, despising the shame," and was "made perfect through sufferings to lead many sons to glory." 

Frequent references are made in the Apostle's writings to the stipulations concerning eternal life laid out in the constitution of the Kingdom of Heaven. Thus, the believers were "elected in *him* before the foundation of the world," and "eternal life was promised before the times of the ages," "according to the benevolent purposes which *he purposed in himself* for the administration of the fullness of the appointed times, to gather together all under Christ — all in the heavens and all on the earth, under him. He formerly marked us out for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to his purpose, who effectively works all things according to the counsel of his will." 

From all these sayings and references, we must trace the constitution of this kingdom into eternity — before time began. We must date it from *everlasting,* and resolve it into the absolute gracious will of the eternal God. Regarding all the prospective developments of time, "known to God from the beginning," it proposed to make the **Word** flesh, and then to make the Incarnate Word, called Emmanuel, King of Jesus Christ, to give him all who should be reconciled to God through him as *subjects,* to put under him all the angelic hosts, and establish him monarch of earth, *lawgiver* to the universe; and thus make him heir and Lord of all things. 

Since a constitution brings all the elements of a kingdom into a new relationship with one another, it serves as the measure and guarantee of all the privileges, immunities, and obligations accruing to all parties within that relation. It prescribes, arranges, and secures all the privileges, duties, obligations, honors, and rewards of the King and the subjects. Neither can claim more than it stipulates and guarantees, and neither can rightfully be deprived of what is theirs. 

From the premises before us, and the light given to us in these scriptures and those in the margin, we learn —  

***First.*** That God is the author of the constitution of the Kingdom of Heaven; that he proposed it to the **Word** that was made flesh, before the world existed, anticipating all the developments of creation. 

***Second.*** That the **Word** accepted it, because the will of God was always his delight; therefore he said, "I come to do your will, O God!" Hence, "*God* has so loved the world as to give his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him may not perish, but obtain eternal life." 

***Third.*** That as a result, "all *authority* in heaven and earth" was given to Jesus Christ, and all orders of intelligence were subjected to him so that he might be *King* over all and have the power to give eternal life to his people. 

***Fourth.*** That the earth is now the Lord's, the present temporal territory of his kingdom; that the heathen people are given to him for his inheritance, and the ends of the earth for his possession; that all ends of the earth are his, and all dominions, kindreds, tribes, tongues, and people shall yet serve him on earth and glorify him in heaven. 

***Fifth.*** That all whom he redeems are his offspring — his subjects: that he will have their faith, confidence, esteem, admiration, and gratitude forever; that he will be worshiped, honored, and revered by them in a world without end: that God, angels, and saints will delight in him for ever and ever. He has, therefore, the power to raise the dead, judge the world, and present the redeemed pure, holy, happy, and triumphant before his Father, and then to surrender his kingdom to God. 

To fully comprehend the constitution of this kingdom, we must understand more than its history or the way in which it was introduced and proposed. We must view all the elements of the kingdom as *constitutional* elements — the King as a constitutional King; the subjects, laws, and territory, including the ultimate inheritance, as constitutional subjects, laws, territory, inheritance; and, consequently, we shall discuss them in detail. 

***The King***

The Lord Jesus Christ is the constitutional monarch of the Kingdom of Heaven. The privileges guaranteed to him in relation to the kingdom are as follows: 

As King, he is to be the *oracle* of God — to have the disposal of the Holy Spirit — to be Prophet and High Priest of the Temple of God — to hold the throne of his Father — to be governor of all nations on earth, and head of all hierarchs and powers in heaven — the supreme Lawgiver, the only Savior — the resurrection and the life, the ultimate and final Judge of all, and the Heir of all things. These honors, privileges, and powers are secured to him by the irrevocable grant of the God and Father of all; therefore, as Isaiah said, "The Lord comes with a strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him. Behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him." "I have set my King upon my holy hill of Zion." "Ask of me, and I will give you the heathen for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession." "I have made him a leader and commander of the people" — "a light to the Gentiles" — "salvation to the ends of the earth" — "a Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek," "Sit at my right hand until I make your foes your footstool." "The government shall be upon his shoulders." "All things have been delivered to me by my Father." "He is Lord of the dead and the living." "Angels, authorities, and powers are subjected to him." "The Father gave the Spirit without measure to him." "He received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit." "The kingdom is the Lord's, and he is the governor among the nations." "He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth." "They shall fear you as long as sun and moon endure to all generations." "The Father has committed all judgments to the Son." 

However, not to tire the reader with quotes and proofs, we will provide just one more: — "Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights. I have put my Spirit upon him. He shall bring forth judgment to truth. He shall not fail nor be discouraged until he has set judgment on the earth; and the Isles shall wait for his law." — "I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand and keep you, and give you for a *covenant* of the people, for a *light* to the Gentiles — to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison house." 

***The Subjects of the Kingdom***

They are all born again. Their privileges and honors are as follows: —  

***First.*** Their constitutional King is the only begotten Son of God; whose titles and honors include — Image of the invisible God — Radiance of the Father's glory — Emmanuel — Sustainer of the universe — Prophet of the Prophets — High Priest of the temple of God — King of kings — Lord of lords — the only Sovereign — Commander and Covenant of the people — Captain of Salvation — Counselor, Lawgiver, Redeemer, Deliverer, Mediator, Savior, Advocate, Judge. He is the Sun of Righteousness, Prince of Peace, Lamb of God, Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root and Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star, Light of the World, the Faithful and True Witness, Bishop of Souls, Great Shepherd of the Sheep, Head of the Church, Lord of all, Heir of the Universe, the Resurrection and the Life, the Son of Man, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the Amen, etc. Such is the Christian's King, whose assistance in all these roles, offices, and relationships is guaranteed to him in the Constitution. Indeed, it is all expressed in one promise — "*I will be your God, and you shall be my people.*" 

***Second.*** It is guaranteed that "their sins and iniquities are to be remembered no more." "There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ." "Sin shall have no dominion, nor lord it over them." The Lord does not impute sin to them. They are all pardoned, justified, and saved from sin. 

***Third.*** They are adopted into the family of God; made sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty, children of God, and heirs — joint heirs with Christ. They have an Advocate in the heavens, through whom their persons and prayers are accepted. 

***Fourth.*** They all know the Lord. "All your children shall be taught by God." The Holy Spirit of God writes the law of God upon their hearts and inscribes it upon their understanding: so that they need not teach each man his fellow citizen to know the Lord, "for they all know him from the least to the greatest." They are sanctified through the truth — separated and consecrated to God. 

***Fifth.*** They have the promise of a resurrection from the dead and eternal life; an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading — new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness alone shall dwell forever. 

Such are the constitutional rights and privileges of the citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven. All these have obtained for them the following titles and honors: — Kingdom of Heaven; Israel of God; chosen generation; body of Christ; children of God; dwelling of God; family of God; Jerusalem from above; Mount Zion; peculiar people; the elect of God; holy nation; temple of the Holy Spirit; house of God; city of the living God; pillar and ground of the truth; living stones; seed of Abraham; citizens of heaven; lights of the world; salt of the earth; heirs of God; joint heirs with Christ, etc. 

The privileges, honors, and rewards belong to every citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven. Indeed, they are all encompassed in the summary presented by Paul (from Jeremiah) to the believing Hebrews: — "This is the constitution that I will make with the house of Israel for those days: I will put my laws into their minds, and inscribe them on their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. And they shall not teach every man his fellow citizen, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest; because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more." To this summary, the reader may also add those scriptures in the margin that confirm the above.

***The Laws of the Kingdom***

The supreme law of the kingdom is *love* — love for the King and love for one another. From this law flow all its religious homage and morality. Countless precepts and examples present this to the minds of all citizens. The Kingdom of Heaven is divided into small societies, called *churches,* or *congregations of the Lord.* Each of these communities, in the reception of members, in the education and discipline of them, or in excluding them when necessary, is to be governed by the apostolic instructions: for to the Apostles, the Savior entrusted the management of his kingdom. After they had made citizens by preaching the gospel and baptizing, they were commanded to teach them to observe all that the Savior had commanded them. 

These laws and practices of the Apostles must be learned from what the Apostles published to the world, after the ascension and coronation of the King, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles: for we shall see in the sequel that the gospel was fully developed, and the complete doctrine of the Reign of Christ *began* to be proclaimed in Jerusalem on the first Pentecost after the ascension. 

The old or Jewish constitution was proclaimed first on Sinai on the first Pentecost after the redemption of Israel from Egyptian bondage; and from that day, and what is written afterward in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, all the laws, customs, and manners authorized by the national constitution are documented. They are not to be sought in Genesis, nor in the preceding economy. Neither are the statutes and laws of the Christian kingdom to be sought from Jewish scriptures, nor prior to the day of Pentecost; except to the extent that our Lord himself, during his lifetime, presented the doctrine of his reign. But that is for another discussion when we determine the *beginning* of this kingdom. 

There is one universal law of naturalization, or for creating citizens out of all nations, enjoined upon those citizens of the kingdom who are engaged in proselytizing; but the laws of this kingdom, like those of every other kingdom, are only obligatory on the citizens. 

The weekly celebration of the death and resurrection of Jesus, along with the weekly gathering of disciples for this purpose and for the edification of one another in their most holy faith, constitutes the only positive statutes of the kingdom; and, therefore, there is no law, statute, or observance in this kingdom that in any way hinders its extension from East to West, from North to South, or impedes its progress throughout all the nations of the world. 

However, it is worthy of note that every part of Christian worship, in the small communities distributed over the territory of the Kingdom of Heaven, like so many candlesticks in a large structure, is intended to enlighten and convert the world; and, therefore, in all the gatherings of the family of God, they should be supremely focused on this mission, regarding themselves as the "pillar and ground of the truth." 

Concerning the specifics of the laws of the kingdom, we cannot now speak in detail. "The grace of God which brings salvation teaches all the citizens of heaven that, denying all ungodliness and worldly desires, they should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, expecting the blessed hope — namely, the appearing of the glory of the great God and of our Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a peculiar people, zealous for good works." These things the bishops of every community should teach and enforce; for such is the spirit, and such is the aim of all the laws and regulations of the Kingdom of Heaven. 

***The Territory of the Kingdom***

In all other kingdoms, except the Kingdom of Heaven, the territory is the national domain and inheritance. It was thus in the first Kingdom of God under the constitution from Sinai. But in the typical kingdom, they lived distanced from their inheritance for one generation. During these forty years, as they camped in the wilderness, *God was their inheritance.* He rained bread from heaven upon them and sent them flesh upon the east wind. He made the flinty rock Horeb a living spring, whose stream followed them all the way to Jordan. He renewed their garments daily, so that for forty years they did not wear out, nor did they need a single patch. A pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day guided them toward Canaan, the land of their inheritance. 

The entire earth is the present territory of the Kingdom of Heaven, but the new heavens and new earth are to be its *inheritance.* The earth, in fact, is the Lord's, and all that is in it; but both the children of God and the children of the wicked one — the *wheat* and the *darnel,* are both planted within it, and must grow until the harvest. The righteous have their bread and water guaranteed to them during their lives; for "godliness is beneficial for all things, having *promise of the life that now is,* as well as of that which is to come." But the joint heirs of Christ are never instructed to regard the earth as their inheritance. They may indeed say, though poor and lacking, "All things are ours; whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come — all are ours, and we are Christ's, and Christ is God's." But, like the Jews on their journey to Canaan, "they seek a better country" — "they seek a city yet to come." "My kingdom," says Jesus, "is not of this world." And, therefore, in the world, Christians are strangers and pilgrims, and should expect tribulation. 

Here, the earth is the present *theater of war;* therefore all Christians in the territory are *soldiers.* Their expenses and rations are provided, the arms and munitions of war supplied to them from the armories on Mount Zion, the stronghold and fortress of the kingdom, where the King, the heads of departments, and all the legions of angels reside. Thus, upon entering the Army of the Faith, each soldier is equipped with the armor of God; and when inducted into the heavenly tactics under the Captain of Salvation, he is expected to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ, fighting the good fight of faith courageously and victoriously. 

The Kingdom of Heaven in this territory faces significant opposition from the kingdom of Satan, which constantly seeks to make an *inheritance* out of the territory of the militant kingdom of righteousness; thus, the citizens must grapple not with flesh and blood, but with the rulers of the darkness of this world — with spiritual wickedness in high places. 

Since the inception of this kingdom, the governments of this world have either directly opposed it or at best remained pretended friends; and thus, their influence has always worked against the true spirit and character of the Christian institution. Christians have little to expect from them other than freedom of conscience and protection from violence, while leading peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and honesty, until Jesus takes to himself his great power, casts down all these rulers from their thrones, and makes his cause triumphant — a consummation devoutly to be wished, and which cannot now be regarded as far off. 

***Manner and Customs of the Kingdom***

Concerning *the manners and customs* of the Kingdom of Heaven, they are those that generally prevailed in the land of Judea and in the East at the time of its establishment: or rather, they are the simple manners and customs of the *family worship age* of the world. These are sanctified by performance with reference to Jesus Christ or from motives prompted by the doctrine of the Reign of Heaven. Just as we treat our natural brothers and sisters in public and private — as we address, greet, and converse with them — as we conduct all family business and affairs — so are Christians to treat one another. There is no other virtue or utility in these practices, other than the love and kindness they foster and their regard for the Lord. 

***Induction into the Kingdom of Heaven***

In every kingdom, whether human or divine, there is a legal door of admission. That is, in the statute book of Heaven, called a *birth.* Into the kingdom of nature, we are born. Into the future and ultimate kingdom of glory, we enter, both soul and body, by being resurrected from the grave. As Christ, the firstborn from the dead, entered the heavenly kingdom, so must all his siblings. And regarding the kingdom we are discussing, as it currently exists in this world, Jesus himself taught that no one can lawfully enter it unless they are born again, or "*born of water and the Spirit.*" The analogy is complete among the kingdoms of nature, grace, and glory. Hence, we have natural birth, metaphorical or spiritual birth, and supernatural birth. There is being born of the flesh — being born of the Spirit — being born of the grave; and there is a kingdom for the flesh — a kingdom for the Spirit — and a kingdom for the glorified man. 

This second, or new birth, which inducts one into the Kingdom of God, always follows a death and burial, just as it will into the everlasting kingdom of glory. It is indeed a literal death and burial preceding a literal resurrection into the heavenly and eternal kingdom. It is also a metaphorical or figurative death and burial, before the figurative resurrection or new birth into the Kingdom of Heaven. Water is the element in which this burial and resurrection are performed, according to the constitutional laws of the Kingdom of Heaven. Hence, Jesus connects the water and the Spirit when speaking of entering the Kingdom of God. 

In naturalizing aliens, the commandment of the King is first — present them with the Constitution, or preach to them *the gospel of the kingdom.* As soon as they understand and believe this, and desire to be transferred into the Kingdom of Christ and of God, that "they may receive the forgiveness of sins and inheritance among all the sanctified," they should be buried in water in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and raised out of it while confessing their death to sin, their faith in Christ's sacrifice and resurrection: and thus they are born of water and the Spirit, and made citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven. *To all who thus receive him, he gives the privilege to become children of God;* for they are "*born of God*" — born of *God,* when born of water and the Spirit, because this is the institution of God. 

In these days of apostasy, men have sought out many inventions. Some have tried to enter the Kingdom of Heaven without being born at all. Others believe they can be born of the Spirit without water, thinking that the king is satisfied with those born without a mother, just as much as with those lawfully born of father and mother. Others think that neither Spirit nor water is necessary; but if they are politically born of the flesh, they can enter the kingdom as rightfully as the Jewish circumcised infants can enter the earthly kingdom of Israel. However, since we have no faith in any modern changes or updates to the gospel, nor amendments to the constitution of the Kingdom of Heaven, we must leave them to account to the King himself, who "*have transgressed the law, changed the ordinance, and broken the everlasting covenant;*" and proceed to the question, “When did the Kingdom of Heaven begin?” (See next essay)

# 1. Patriarchal Age of the World

The world has its infancy just like man. Families preceded nations. Family worship was, therefore, the first religious institution.

At the head of this institution naturally stood **the father of every family**. By necessity and choice, he was the prophet, priest, and king of his household. As a **prophet**, he instructed his household in the knowledge of God and in the history of mankind. As a **priest**, he officiated at his family altar, interceded for those under his care, and pronounced blessings upon his children. As a **lawgiver** and **king**, he commanded his children and servants, rewarding them based on their merits. By divine ordination, the **first fathers of mankind** were constituted as prophets, priests, and kings. Thus, the first religious and political institution is properly called **the Patriarchal**.

Family worship was, therefore, the **first social worship**, and during the initial ages of the world (for at least 2500 years), it was the **only social worship** of divine authority. Although other institutions have since been established, this one has never been replaced. Built upon the matrimonial bond, the most ancient of all religious and political institutions, founded on nature itself, it can never be superseded. While the forms of this worship have always adapted to the various revelations of God granted to mankind, it has persisted through all the changes of six thousand years and will continue until the day when men, like angels of God, shall neither marry nor be given in marriage.

Family worship, as long as it remained the only social worship, underwent no significant change; this period is properly called **the Patriarchal age of the world**. As long as the descendants of one man and one woman remained under the paternal roof, or until they became heads of families themselves, they continued under this religious and political system. If, after marriage, they did not move far from the ancestral home, the paternal authority was still recognized and accepted. Thus, in time, he who started as the head of a single family, if he lived longer and his progeny multiplied, became the paternal prince or chief patriarch of a tribe.

In the early days of time and the freshness of human nature, families quickly grew large; and since the father and head could not always be present during his lifetime and might die before all his children could become heads of families, it became necessary to appoint a substitute in his absence and a successor in the event of his premature death. Nature and reason both pointed to the firstborn son, and religion consecrated him as his representative. Consequently, the privileges and honors of the firstborn son were both religious and political; thus, the duties placed upon him entitled him to a double portion of the inheritance. Esau was, therefore, both **prodigal** and **profane** for selling his birthright for a meal of stew.

The antiquity of this arrangement was evident in the envy and jealousy of Cain, stirred by the rejection of his offering and the acceptance of Abel's. That jealousy seems to have been inflamed by rage over his birthright. This is implied in God's address to Cain when that address is properly translated and understood. "If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it." 

The moral and religious institutions of patriarchal or family worship, which continued from the fall of Adam to the covenant of circumcision, included the Sabbath, the service of the altar, oral instruction, prayer, praise, and benediction. With the addition of circumcision in the family of one patriarch for specific purposes, these were the components of that system which lasted for two thousand five hundred years.

The religious observance of weeks or Sabbaths in commemoration of Creation and in anticipation of eternal rest, emerging from the sacrificial and typological institution, was religiously observed up to the giving of the law or the establishment of the Jewish institution. Thus, the law of the Sabbath begins with the words, **"Remember the Sabbath."** The righteous always remembered the weeks and regarded the end of the week as holy to the Lord. Hence, even after the apostasy, which led to the neglect of family worship due to the sons of God intermarrying with the daughters of men—resulting in a flood upon the ungodly world—we find Noah faithfully counting his weeks even while in the ark. In the wilderness of Sin, before the law was given, we also find the Jews observing the Sabbath. To facilitate this observance, God performed three special miracles during Israel's journey. He provided a double portion of manna on the sixth day, none on the seventh, and preserved from spoil the portion set aside for the Sabbath.

Sin offerings and thank offerings, presented on altars made of stone or earth, were made to the Lord—the former in faith of the promise concerning the bruising of the serpent's head by the offspring of the woman, and the latter in grateful acknowledgment of God's goodness in creation and providence. Cain, lacking faith in the promised redemption, like many deists and natural religionists today, acknowledged God's goodness and care through a thank offering; but Abel, **by faith in that promise**, not only offered his thank offering but also a lamb as a sin offering. Therefore, while God did not respect Cain's offering without faith in that promise, He testified in favor of Abel's **gifts**—He accepted his sin offering and his thank offering.

In the very brief and general outlines of nearly two thousand five hundred years found in the book of Genesis, we see various references to this part of the patriarchal institution. Immediately after exiting the ark, we find Noah building his altar on the purified earth and offering to the Lord whole burnt offerings of every clean bird and beast. Thus, Noah began to worship the Lord according to the patriarchal institution after the flood. Similarly, we see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Job, and other patriarchs presenting their sacrifices to the Lord, with family worship being the sole religious institution in the world.

Even libations, drink offerings, and anointing as tokens of gratitude and consecration are found in this ancient and venerable institution. "Jacob rose early in the morning, took the stone he had used as a pillow, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it." "And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where God spoke with him, a stone pillar, and poured a drink offering on it and also poured oil on it."

A beautiful and instructive example of ancient family worship and the priestly functions exercised by the patriarchs regarding **the altar** is found in that ancient book, believed by many to have been written by Moses while in Midian; but according to some, by Job himself, who was certainly contemporary with **Eliphaz the Temanite**. Eliphaz was the son of Teman, who was the son of Eliphaz, the first son of Esau, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham. He therefore lived before Moses. We observe that he also officiated at the altar. We are told, "His sons went and feasted in each other's houses, one on his day, and sent for their sisters to eat and drink with them. When their days of feasting were over, Job sent and sanctified them, and rose early in the morning and offered burnt offerings for each of them, for Job said, 'It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.' Thus Job continually acted."

The same Job, by divine appointment, acted as priest or intercessor for his three friends, princes of Edom; for having spoken wrongly, they were commanded to take seven bullocks and seven rams, go to Job, the servant of God, and offer them for themselves; "Job my servant shall pray for you." "Job prayed for them, and the Lord accepted his prayer and forgave Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar." "The Lord also accepted and blessed Job after he had prayed for his friends, and turned Job's captivity."

During this period of the world, there was but one high or general priest, specifically called and sent by God. "He was King of Salem and Priest of the Most High God." To him, the patriarch Abraham paid tithes or gave a tenth of the spoils taken in war, and Melchizedek blessed him. He was of a unique order, with no predecessor, successor, or equal during the age of family worship.

From all these facts and accounts, we learn that the service of the altar initially belonged to the father of the family—next, to his eldest son—that it involved presenting various sin offerings and thank offerings on behalf of themselves or their families—that all pious sons and individuals could **for themselves** erect altars, offer sacrifices, and pour out libations and thank offerings to the Lord;—that these sacrificial observances were generally, if not always, accompanied by prayer, intercession, and thanksgivings;—and that intercession on behalf of those under any father or patriarch's care was a part of the initial institution.

Benediction was also one of the first duties of this office. Fathers pronounced blessings over their children. Elders blessed their juniors. Melchizedek blessed Abraham, Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob blessed the twelve patriarchs. The invoking of blessings and the laying on of hands upon the head were parts of the family worship institution.

Regarding prayer and praise, since we cannot imagine a religion without them, it is unnecessary to elaborate on them as aspects of the patriarchal institution. Jubal soon taught men to play the harp and organ, and piety soon consecrated them for the praise of God. The melodies of nature quickly taught men to tune their voices to God. Isaac went into the fields at evening for private prayer. Abraham interceded for Sodom until he was ashamed to pursue his requests any further; and he made his requests to God for Abimelech, king of Egypt, and his family. Concerning him and his patriarchal character, God stated, "I know Abraham that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the ways of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, so that the Lord may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken concerning him."

Prophets of public character were occasionally raised up to guide men back to the primitive simplicity of the patriarchal institution, as well as to lead them forward to the future revelations of God's purposes regarding the work of redemption. Among these, the most notable were Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. All were granted new visions of the future, making them preachers of righteousness and reformers in their respective generations.

From these excerpts from the book of Genesis, one learns that the family worship institution, divinely instituted in the first age of the world, included observance of the Sabbath, the service of the altar, oral instruction, prayer, intercession, thanksgiving, and benediction. It contemplated no other bond of union apart from the marriage covenant and the relationships arising from it. Acting justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God were emphasized in all its principles and in the examples of those whom God honored and approved.

During the long period of this family institution, no community separated from the world was larger than a single household—no public altars—no temples—no established order of public teachers; therefore, there were no initiating or separating institutions. There was no **circumcision** for infants, nor **washing of regeneration** for the instructed. These later institutions were intended for publicly professing communities; hence, for two thousand years, there was no initiating rite or ordinance among men.

Wherever family curtains were spread and a tent erected, the devout father built his altar to the Lord, gathered his children and household around him, instructed them in the knowledge of God, the creator and preserver of all, and in the history of man, his origin and destiny, as far as it was revealed to them. They offered their thank offerings, acknowledgments for favors received; and when aware of sin, they presented their sin offering with confessions and, in faith of God's promise, sought forgiveness. These are the essential attributes of the patriarchal institution and of family worship as learned from the writings of Moses.

But since the foundation of all subsequent dispensations of God's mercy and favor to man was planted in the patriarchal institution, it is crucial to our plan, before moving forward, to focus on one of the patriarchs, whose fame is eternal, whom God honored above all earthly honors, and who is recorded in history as **the friend of God**. The intelligent reader needs no explanation; we now specifically turn our attention to Abraham.

## ***Abraham***

Reader, take note! "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations." Shouldn't the name, the calling, the blessing, and the history of Abraham continually occupy a significant space in the records of God's governance over mankind and in all the details of His redemption?

Due to his unprecedented faith in God's promises and his elevated piety, he was designated as the **father of all believers**; his entire life serves as a model for all the children of God, exemplifying how to walk by faith in God's promises.

Thus, pertinent to our current discussion, we observe that **during the family worship institution**, shortly after the beginning of the third millennium, about the 75th year of his life, God appeared to Abraham while he lived in Ur of the Chaldeans and commanded him to leave that land, promising him certain things. Abraham obeyed. God generously offered him **two promises**, not only significant and valuable to Abraham himself but to all of humanity.

These two promises were designed to be the foundation of a dual relationship with God and the basis for two distinct religious institutions, known as "the Old Testament and the New," "the Old Covenant and the New," "the Two Covenants," and "the Covenants of Promise." They envisage the constitution for both a temporal and spiritual kingdom of God—a kingdom of God in this world, and a kingdom of God not of this world. Therefore, let it always be remembered, when we try to form correct understandings of the entire economy of God's redemption, that these two promises were made while the patriarchal institution was still active and several centuries before its conclusion. What, then, it will be asked, are these two promises?

## ***Two Promises?***

We find them in their simplest form at the beginning of the 12th chapter of Genesis.

**The first —** "I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, and you shall be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you."

**The second —** "In you all the families of the earth will be blessed."

These promises, when fully developed, contained numerous blessings. They, however, in all their specifics, remain separate and distinct. Abraham's family alone is personally concerned in the first—while all families of the earth are included in the second. The former entails temporal and earthly blessings—the latter offers spiritual and eternal blessings. Paul refers to the second as "the gospel preached to Abraham" and "the covenant confirmed by God regarding the Messiah, four hundred and thirty years before the giving of the law." The Jewish kingdom, in all its glory, was merely the unfolding of the first—the Christian kingdom, in its present and future blessings, is the culmination of the second.

## ***Covenant of Circumcision***

In accordance with the first promise, and to ensure its precise fulfillment, about twenty-four years after its announcement, the **Covenant of Circumcision** was established. This "covenant in the flesh" identified and defined the natural descendants of Abraham, providing the world with clear evidence of God's faithfulness and enabling everyone to ascertain how God keeps His covenants with His people. This bestowed the title of "The Circumcision" upon the descendants of Abraham and beautifully illustrated the separation of God's people from the children of this world.

The land of Canaan, as **the inheritance** of this nation, is repeatedly promised to Abraham; and as soon as Isaac, the child of promise, is born and circumcised, the promise of the "**seed**" through which all nations would be blessed becomes specific to him. It is not in Ishmael, but "in Isaac shall **your seed** be called."

After the death of Abraham and towards the end of Isaac's life, his father's God gave him a second iteration of these two promises. The first was considerably elaborated upon, while the second was repeated almost verbatim. That which was initially intended to be accomplished is now first outlined in detail, pointing out its provisions. "I will be with you and bless you; for to you and your descendants, I will give all these lands, and I will perform all the oaths which I swore to Abraham your father; I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of heaven, and I will give your descendants all these lands; and through your seed, all the nations of the earth will be blessed: because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."

These same two promises are reiterated almost word for word to Jacob, the son of Isaac, at the time he had the vision of a ladder reaching from earth to heaven, while, in obedience to a command from his parents, he was on his way to Padan-aram to find a wife. On **three** major occasions — to Abraham — to Isaac — to Jacob — these two promises are solemnly declared; always presented in the same order—never confounded; as distinct as earth and heaven—time and eternity.

Four hundred and thirty years after the initial declaration of these promises, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were redeemed from bondage in Egypt, fulfilling the promise; and saved from Pharaoh's tyranny and cruelty. To further ensure the *full completion* of its stipulations, God, through Moses, proposed a covenant with all Israel at Sinai; in which He guarantees to perform everything for them that was contemplated in the promise, confirmed by an oath to Abraham, by being a God to his seed after him.

## ***Sinaitic Covenant***

This Sinaitic covenant constituted them as a kingdom of God, a holy nation, a peculiar people. All the blessings encompassed in the first promise to Abraham, or that could arise from the relationship to God envisioned in it, were extensively elaborated in this transaction and secured to the entire nation. However, the relation was temporary, and its blessings were temporal and earthly. The second promise was not included in the Jewish institution or covenant at Sinai, nor did it form part of the patriarchal or previous institution. The symbolic aspect of family worship was expanded and incorporated into the **national** institution; and whatever **spiritual** privileges the Jew enjoyed were shared with the patriarch—through faith in the second promise, and with informed and believing participation in all the appointed means that either prefigured the coming redemption or realized the blessings derived through the promised seed.

The **seed** through whom all the families of the earth would be blessed was found in the nation, but in no other sense than as it was within the people while in Egypt or in the patriarchs before their descent into Egypt. It existed within the nation, but was not a component of the national institution. They had the second promise made to their forefathers, and all the faithful and approved among them believed that promise and acted accordingly. Thus, among the Jews, even before the coming of the Messiah, there were:

## ***Two Seeds***

The natural and the spiritual children of Abraham. The entire nation were his literal and natural children; and those among them who believed in the second promise and understood it were not only his natural children but were also his children in the same sense as all **believing Gentiles**, who, by virtue of the second promise, are counted as the children of Abraham. The first group, like Ishmael, were born according to the flesh—the fleshly seed of Abraham; the second group, like Isaac, were the children of faith in the promise: Thus, Abraham is the father of all who believe in that promise, regardless of their lineage.

However, the second promise was not fulfilled for nearly one thousand five hundred years after the first, or after the national institution was confirmed at Sinai; and therefore:

## ***The Blessings of Abraham***

The blessings which were to come upon the nations through his seed—through faith in the fulfilled promises—was intended to be the foundation and substance of a new institution. This **"blessing of Abraham"** encompasses all the spiritual and eternal blessings laid up in his seed, who is at the center of this new constitution, in whom all the promises of God are verified, and in whom they are set aside for the comfort and salvation of all God's faithful children. Whatever pertained to Abraham's family, emerging from the first promise, descended upon the family principle that is purely **flesh**; but whatever concerns all saints of all nations is rooted in the new principle of **faith**. "Those who are of faith," says Paul, "are blessed along with believing Abraham." And "If you are Christ’s, then" and only then, "are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise."

The blessing of Abraham was thus promised during the patriarchal age, preceding the Jewish national institution and independent of it; therefore, that institution cannot affect, much less nullify, the blessings promised in the covenant established by God concerning the Messiah during the age of family worship, and four hundred and thirty years before the Jewish institution began.

In calling Abraham, and making him the father of many nations and the steward of even more precious promises and revelations, God did not supersede family worship. He merely added to the reservoir of religious knowledge, strengthened faith, and expanded hopes for that singular family. The family institution continued with barely any change, except for one detail specified in the covenant of circumcision concerning Abraham's singular family, for four hundred and thirty years after the declarations regarding his seed and those regarding the Messiah were assured to this esteemed patriarch. Thus, we have traced the continuation of the family religion, or patriarchal economy, for two thousand five hundred years, and are now prepared to make some remarks on the Jewish national institution, although we have already anticipated nearly all that pertains to our current objective. Nevertheless, we shall still provide it with a distinct notice. (See Next Essay)

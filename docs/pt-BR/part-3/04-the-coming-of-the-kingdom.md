# 4. The Coming of the Kingdom

When did the Kingdom of Heaven begin? "With the ministry of John," says one; "With the ministry of Jesus," says another; "With the first sending out of the Twelve Apostles," claims a third; "At the resurrection of Jesus," argues a fourth; "At none of them, but gradually from the baptism of John until the fall of Jerusalem," states a fifth.

The reader should remember that there are at least *five elements* essential to a perfectly organized kingdom, and that it may be examined in relation to one or more of these components. This is reflected in the numerous and varied parables of the Savior. Sometimes He speaks of the management of its affairs — its principles in the heart — its subjects — its King — its territory — its progress — and various incidents in its history. Therefore, the parable of the sower, the wheat and tares, the leaven, the merchant seeking fine pearls, the mustard seed, the dragnet, the marriage of a king’s son, a nobleman traveling to a far country, the ten virgins, the talents, and the sheep and goats present the Kingdom of Heaven in different perspectives, either in relation to its elements or in its history — its beginning or its end.

The arrival or coming of the Reign of Heaven can properly pertain only to one or two of the elements of a kingdom; or to the formal demonstration of that whole organization of society which we call *a kingdom.* It cannot refer to its territory; for that was created and designated before man was formed. It cannot allude to the individuals who became subjects, as they also existed before the kingdom started. It cannot refer to the birth or baptism of the King, for it was not until after these events that Jesus *began* to proclaim its coming or approach. It cannot reference the ministry of John or of Jesus, any more than to the patriarchal or Jewish dispensations; because Jesus did not start to proclaim the coming of this reign *until after John was imprisoned.* This is a fact of such significance that Matthew, Mark, and Luke clearly state that, in accordance with ancient predictions, Jesus was to begin proclaiming in *Galilee,* and *that he did not begin to proclaim the doctrine or the gospel of the coming of the Reign until after John’s ministry ended and he was thrown into prison.* The Evangelists concur in this assertion: "Now Jesus hearing that John had been imprisoned, withdrew into Galilee; and having left Nazareth, he settled in Capernaum. For thus says the Prophet," etc. From that time on, Jesus *began* to proclaim, saying, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near;" or, "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand," as the common version states.

Some Baptists, for the sake of *immersion,* and some of our Reformation brethren, for the sake of *immersion for the remission of sins,* seem eager to place John in the Kingdom of Heaven and to date the beginning of the Christian dispensation from John the Baptist’s first appearance. They argue in support of this theory that Jesus said, "The Law and the Prophets lasted until John," (the only instructors of men); "since that time, the Kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone presses into it." "Tax collectors and sinners show you the way into the Kingdom of Heaven," Jesus told the Pharisees. Again, He lamented, "Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees! You shut the Kingdom of Heaven against men, and you will not enter yourselves, nor permit those who would to enter." "The Kingdom of God is within you." "The Kingdom of Heaven has come upon you." From these premises, they argue that the Kingdom of Heaven was indeed established by John the Baptist: "For," they say, "how could men and women *enter a kingdom* that had not yet been established? And did not John immerse for the remission of sins and call on people to repent and reform prior to baptism?"

The Paidobaptists, too, insist that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and all the circumcised Jews are in the Kingdom of Heaven, as Jesus said, "Before Abraham was, I am;" "Abraham saw my day and rejoiced;" and Paul states that Moses regarded the reproach of Christ as greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt, and forsook Egypt in faith of the Christian reward. Yes, Paul asserts that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their families, who lived in tents in the promised land, sought not just rest in Canaan but a heavenly country, looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. Consequently, the Jews recognized Christ in the manna and in the rock, as well as in baptism through the cloud and the sea.

The error is fundamentally the same. Christ was promised and foreshadowed before He came, and the Kingdom of Heaven was promised and preached by John, Jesus, the Twelve, and the Seventy, (who went out proclaiming the good news of the Reign), before the Reign of Christ, or Kingdom of Heaven, began. Because Christ was foretold and foreshadowed in the patriarchal and Jewish eras, the Paidobaptists assert that the Kingdom of Heaven existed on earth since the days of Abel; and because the good news of the Kingdom and its principles were proclaimed by John, the Baptists argue that John the Baptist was in the Kingdom of Heaven and was the very one who established it.

Let us, then, examine this issue with all openness: first, we shall place the passages quoted from the testimonies of the Evangelists on one side and the following passages on the other, and see if we can reconcile them. John says, "Repent, for the Kingdom of God is near." Jesus began to proclaim, saying, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near." He also directed the Twelve and the Seventy to travel throughout Judea, making the same proclamation. Of John the Baptist He stated, although he was greater than all the Prophets, "The least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he."

Thus, after John was beheaded, we have about eighty-four preachers daily proclaiming the imminent approach of the Reign of God; and Jesus often assuring His disciples that the Kingdom of God was soon to appear, and that some of His companions would witness Him enter into His Reign before they died — and yet the Kingdom was established by John! Scribes and Pharisees were blocking the kingdom against men when Jesus had only given the keys to Peter! John the Baptist was in the kingdom, and yet the least in the kingdom is greater than he! More than eighty preachers say, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;" and John the Baptist, before his death, ushered all of Judea and Jerusalem into it! How then shall we reconcile these apparent contradictions? If we make both sides figurative, it may be done. If we regard both sides literally, it cannot be done! To assert that the kingdom came in one respect at one time and in another respect at another time only suggests that it arrived in different senses — literally and figuratively. For our part, we must believe that the Kingdom of Heaven began, or the Reign of Heaven literally and truly commenced on a specific day.

Many of its principles were revealed by the ancient Prophets; David, Isaiah, and others wrote extensively about it; John the Baptist proclaimed its immediate and near approach, and more fully articulated its spiritual purpose; therefore, he was superior to them. Jesus often revealed its character and purpose in various parables; and everyone who understood and embraced these *principles* was said to "press into the kingdom," or to have "the kingdom within them;" and wherever these principles were proclaimed, "the Kingdom of Heaven" was said to "come near" to the people, or to have "overtaken them;" and those who opposed these principles and obstructed others from receiving them were said to "shut the Kingdom of Heaven against men;" thus all these scriptures must necessarily be interpreted in light of their contexts: for it is impossible that the Reign of Heaven could literally begin "*until Jesus was glorified,*" "received the promise of the Holy Spirit," was "made Lord and Christ," and "sat down with His Father upon the throne" — for He left the earth *to receive a kingdom.*

To make this, if possible, even more evident, we ask *When did the Kingdom of God, established by Moses among the descendants of Abraham, cease?* This question penetrates the entire nature and necessity of the case: for can anyone suppose that there were two Kingdoms of God on earth at the same time? Certainly the first must have ceased before the second began.

Now, that the kingdom of God, ministered by Moses, had not ceased during the personal ministry of the Messiah on earth, is, we think, abundantly clear from the following facts and documents:

***First.*** Jesus was to have appeared, and did appear, "*at the end of the world,*" or the last days of the first Kingdom of God. "At the conclusion of the age He appeared to take away sin by the sacrifice of Himself." The "world to come" was one of the names of the gospel age. He has not subjected "the world to come" to angels, as He did the world that was, according to Paul to the Hebrews. Therefore, He appeared not in the beginning of the gospel age, but at the end of the Jewish age.

***Second.*** The Temple was the house of God until the very end of Jesus's life. For it was not until the Jewish leaders conspired to kill Him that He left it. At His final festival of life, just before He fell into their hands, as He walked out of the Temple, He said, "Behold, your house is left desolate, for you shall not see Me henceforth until you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!" It was His Father's house, the house of God, until that moment. Then, indeed, the glory departed.

***Third.*** Jewish offerings and service, as a divine institution, continued until the condemnation of Jesus. He sent the healed leper to the priest to make the offering commanded by the law. He instructed the people to listen to the teachers of the law who sat in Moses' seat. He paid the temple tax. He was a minister of the circumcision. He lived *under,* not *after* the law. He kept all its ordinances and instructed all His disciples to regard it in its original import and authority until the Last Supper. *Indeed, it could not be abrogated, for it was not fulfilled until on the cross He said,* "**It is finished**."

***Fourth.*** When He visited Jerusalem the last time and gave the final parable, He plainly told them that "the Kingdom of God would be taken from them" and given to a nation that would make better use of the honors of the kingdom; consequently, at that time the Jews had the Kingdom of God.

***Fifth.*** It was only after His death that the veil of the Temple was torn; that the things "which could be shaken were shaken." It was then, and not until then, that He nailed the legal institution to the cross. Then, and not before, was the dividing wall of hostility broken down. The last Sabbath He spent in the grave. *From the moment of His death, there was no life in the old Kingdom of God.* The Temple was abandoned, its veil torn, its foundation shaken, the city destroyed, the ritual abolished, and as after death the judgment — the Temple, city, and nation awaited the day of His vengeance.

The Kingdom of God was evidently in the Jewish institution until Jesus died. Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven did not come while Jesus lived. In anticipation, those who believed the gospel of the kingdom received the Kingdom of God, just as in expectation He said, "I have finished the work which You gave Me to do" before He began to suffer; and as He said, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood, shed for the remission of the sins of many," before it was shed. So while the doctrines of this reign — faith, repentance, baptism, and a new principle of sonship to Abraham — were being proclaimed by John, the Twelve, the Seventy, and by Himself, the Kingdom of Heaven was approaching; and those who received these principles in anticipation were said to enter into the kingdom or to have the kingdom within them.

The principles of any reign or revolution are always discussed, debated, and examined before a new order of things is established. A party is formed around these principles before garnering strength or appointing a leader competent to initiate a new order. In society, as in nature, we first see the blade, then the stalk, and finally the ripe grain. We call it wheat or corn when we have only the promise in the blade. In a similar way, the Kingdom of God was referred to while only its principles were being proclaimed.

When these American states were colonial subjects of the king of England, long prior to establishing a republic, republican doctrines were discussed and deliberated. The supporters and advocates of these doctrines were labeled republicans, even before a republic existed on this continent. He who marks the beginning of the Kingdom of Heaven from John the Baptist's ministry aligns with those who frame the beginning of the American republic from the initial proclamation of republican principles or from the establishment of a republican party in the British colonies. However, just as a diligent and knowledgeable historian, when writing the history of the American republics, commences with the record of the first declaration of these principles and chronicles the sayings and deeds of the first proponents of the new doctrines, so the sacred historians began their account of the Kingdom of Heaven with John’s appearance in the Judean wilderness, preaching the Messiah, faith, repentance, a holy life, and *raising up a new race of Israelites based on faith rather than flesh;* for this was, in truth, the "blade" of the Kingdom of Heaven.

Having considered all these factors, it is evident that until the Messiah's death His kingdom *could not* commence; and having seen from the record itself that it *did not* begin before His resurrection, we proceed to explore the developments following His resurrection, seeking to determine the day when this kingdom was established or the Reign of Heaven began.

The writer to whom we are most indebted for an orderly and continuous narrative of the affairs of the Kingdom of Heaven is the Evangelist Luke. His account starts with the angelic announcements of John and Jesus’s births, and ends with the appearance of the great standard-bearer of the Cross in Imperial Rome, A.D. 64. The part of the narrative we now consider as a guide to the commencement of the Reign involves the *forty days* that the Lord spent in His crucified body prior to His ascension. The reader should know (for it is assumed he is aware) that Jesus rose in the same body in which He was crucified, and during those forty days, He ate, drank, and conversed with His Apostles and friends in that reanimated physical body. That body was not changed until, like the living saints who shall be on the earth at His second personal coming, it was made spiritual, incorruptible, and glorious at the moment of His ascension. Thus, the man Christ Jesus was made like all His brethren in His death, burial, resurrection, transfiguration, ascension, and glorification; or rather, they shall be made to resemble Him in all these aspects.

The Apostles testify that they saw Him ascend — that a cloud received Him out of their sight — that angels descended to inform them that He was taken up into heaven, not to return for a long time — that He ascended far above the visible heavens, and now fills all things. Stephen, when dying, saw Him standing at the right hand of God.

Much attention should be given to all the events of those forty days — as much at least, as to the forty days spent by Moses on the mountain with God in the affairs of the previous Kingdom of God. For the risen Messiah made the affairs of His approaching kingdom the primary focus during those forty days. Towards the end of this period, and immediately before His ascension, He commissioned His Apostles concerning the establishment of this kingdom. "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me: go, *therefore,*" He said, "make disciples of all nations," "immersing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe *all the things* that I have commanded you; and, lo! I am with you always, even to the end of this age." "But remain in the city of Jerusalem until you are endowed with power from on high." Thus, in accordance with His promise and the ancient prophecy, it was to "begin at Jerusalem."

The risen Savior directs our attention to Jerusalem as the *place,* and to an upcoming period "not many days hence" as the *time* of the initiation of His reign. The significant facts of Jesus’s death, burial, and resurrection not being fully revealed to His Apostles, they could not take steps toward establishing a kingdom that was to be *founded upon Christ crucified.* They needed an interpreter of these facts and a supernatural advocate of the King’s claims before they could lay the foundation of His kingdom.

Additionally, the King Himself must be glorified before His authority could be established on earth; for until He received the promise of the Spirit from His Father and was placed on His throne, the Apostles could not receive it; thus Christ's ascension to heaven and coronation were necessary for the commencement of this Reign of Heaven.

Let us pause for a moment — leave the earth, and on the wings of faith in the testimony of Prophets and Apostles, the two witnesses for Jesus, let us follow Him to heaven and ascertain His reception into the heavens and exaltation to the right hand of God.

***The Ascension of the Messiah***

Prophets and Apostles must now be heeded. David, inspired by the Spirit, states, "The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels; the Lord is among them as in Sinai in the holy place. You have ascended on high; you have led captivity captive; you have received gifts for men; yes, for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them." The same Prophet, in referencing the solemn and joyful procession of the ark of the ancient constitution to Mount Zion, turns his gaze from type to antitype, describing the entrance of the Messiah into Heaven: — "Who shall ascend into the hill of God?" The attending angels in the train of the Messiah, approaching the heaven of heavens, shout, "Lift up your heads, O you gates! be lifted up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in." Those from within, astonished that anyone should so confidently demand entrance into those gates long barred against mankind, respond, "Who is the King of glory?" The angels attending the Messiah reply triumphantly, "The Lord, strong and mighty! the Lord, mighty in battle!" and even more exultingly declare, "Lift up your heads, O you gates! lift them up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is the King of glory? He is the Lord of hosts! He is the King of glory!"

***Coronation of the Messiah***

Everything in its proper place. He who ascended first descended. Jesus died, was buried, raised from the dead, ascended, and was crowned Lord of all. In the presence of all the heavenly hierarchies, the four living creatures, the twenty-four elders, and thousands upon thousands of angels, He presents Himself before the throne. No sooner does the Firstborn from the dead appear in the royal palace of the universe, than His Father and God, in His inaugural address upon anointing Him Lord of all, declares, "Let all the angels of God worship Him" — "Sit at My right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool." "The Lord shall send forth from Zion the rod of Your strength: rule in the midst of Your enemies. "Your people, willing on the day of Your power, shall come to You. In the beauty of holiness, more than the womb of the morning, shall You have the dew of Your progeny. The Lord has sworn and will not repent. You are a Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. The Lord at Your right hand shall strike through kings in the day of His wrath." "Your throne, O God, is forever: the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of righteousness. You have loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of joy above Your companions. You, Lord, at the beginning laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands: they will perish, but You remain; and they will all wear out like a garment, and like a robe, You will roll them up, and they will be changed: but You are the same, and Your years will have no end."

Thus God highly exalted Him and set Him over all the works of His hands, and gave Him a name and honor above every name in heaven and on earth, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, and every tongue confess, to the glory of God.

"Now we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, that He might taste death for everyone, crowned with glory and honor on account of the sufferings of death" — Now "angels, authorities, principalities, and powers are subjected to Him." "His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon Himself shall His crown flourish."

The Holy Spirit, sent down by Jesus from heaven, on the day of Pentecost after His resurrection, to the disciples in attendance in Jerusalem, informs the Apostles of all that had transpired in heaven during the week following His ascension and until that day. Peter, now filled with that promised Spirit, informs the large crowd gathered on the great day of Pentecost that God made that Jesus whom they had crucified both Lord and Christ — exalting Him as a **Prince** and a Savior to grant repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.

The first act of His reign was the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, according to the Prophecy of Joel and His own promise. As soon as He received the kingdom from God His Father, He showered His blessings on His followers; He fulfilled all His promises to the Apostles, *and forgave three thousand of His fiercest enemies.* He received pardon and gifts for those who had rebelled, and abundantly poured out spiritual gifts upon the little flock to whom it pleased the Father to give the kingdom. Thus began the Reign of Heaven, on the day of Pentecost, in the person of the Messiah, the Son of God, and the anointed Monarch of the universe. Under Him, His people, saved from their sins, received a kingdom which cannot be shaken or removed.

However, just as the construction of the Jewish tabernacle, after the commencement of the first Kingdom of God, required time and a united effort from those appointed and qualified for the work; so too did the complete establishment of the new temple of God. The Apostles, as wise master builders, laid the foundation — proclaimed the constitution, laws, and institutions of the King, and raised the banner of the kingdom in various towns, cities, and countries over the span of forty years. Some of them not only witnessed "the Son of Man take His reign," and the Kingdom of God begin on Pentecost, and extend His conquests over Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth; but they also saw the Lord "come with power" and mighty glory, fulfilling all His predictions regarding the desolate and doomed temple, city, and people. Thus they observed a bright display of the golden scepter of His grace in forgiving those who submitted to His authority, and a fearsome display of the iron rod of His wrath in taking vengeance on His enemies who would not have Him reign over them.

***Present Administration of the Kingdom of Heaven***

During the personal absence of the King, He has entrusted the administration of this kingdom to stewards. Initially, these were the Apostles; subsequently, Prophets; then teachers; followed by helpers; and finally overseers or presidents, each equipped with gifts, knowledge, and character suited to their diverse responsibilities. Also employed in establishing and organizing the communities that comprise the Kingdom of Heaven were many individuals endowed with miraculous abilities — gifts of healing and speaking in foreign languages. Angels were also involved, and continue to assist the great King in serving those who are heirs of salvation. For Jesus now, as Lord of all, has the Holy Spirit at His disposal along with all the angels of God; and these are employed by Him in managing the affairs of the kingdom.

The Apostles were plenipotentiaries and ambassadors for Jesus, given all authority from the King. Thus, everything was first taught and mandated by them. They were the initial preachers, teachers, pastors, overseers, and ministers in the kingdom, holding responsibility for all its affairs.

The communities collected and organized by the Apostles were known as the *congregation of Christ,* and collectively, these are sometimes referred to as *the Kingdom of God.* However, the terms "church of God" or "congregation of Christ," and "Kingdom of Heaven" or "Kingdom of God," do not always represent the same thing precisely. It should be noted that the elements of the Kingdom of Heaven are not simply its subjects, and hence not solely the groups of Christ's disciples. But as these communities possess the oracles of God, are governed by the laws and institutions of the King, and thus enjoy the blessings of present salvation, they are considered in the records of the Kingdom as the sole constitutional citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven; and to them uniquely belongs *all the present salvation.* Their King is now in heaven but is present with them by His Spirit in their hearts and in all the institutions of His kingdom.

Every immersed believer of good character is, by the constitution, a free and full citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven, entitled to all the social privileges and honors of that kingdom. Those who meet regularly in one place in obedience to the King, or His ambassadors the Apostles, for the observance of all the institutions of the King, form a family, or household, or congregation of Christ; and all these families or congregations, thus organized, constitute the present Kingdom of God in this world. Thus, the phrases *Kingdom of Heaven* and *the congregation* or *body of Christ* can be considered equivalent in meaning.

Now, in gathering these communities, and in setting them in order, the Apostles had, while alive, and continue to have, through their writings, the exclusive right to legislate, order, and manage all things. However, it is not the will of Jesus Christ, as it is not suited to human nature or to the present state of His kingdom as administered in His absence, that the church should be governed by a *written* document alone. Therefore, in every city, town, and country where the Apostles gathered a community through their own efforts, or through their assistants, setting them in order for edification, usefulness, and influence in this world, they uniformly appointed elders or overseers to labor in the word and teaching, overseeing the entire affairs of the community. Also added were *deacons,* or public *ministers* of the congregation, who, under the direction of the overseers, were to manage all the affairs of these individual families of God. This is precisely what the very titles *Bishop* and *Deacon,* and all the qualifications they possess indicate.

However, since all citizens of the kingdom are free individuals under Christ, they all have a say in the selection of those appointed to office by the Apostles. The Apostles still appoint all persons elected, provided they possess the qualifications outlined by them *through the Holy Spirit.* *And if a congregation will not elect to these offices individuals who hold these qualifications; or if, through their obstinacy and selfishness, they should choose unqualified individuals and thus disregard those marked out by their giftedness; in either case, they reject the authority of the *Ambassadors of Christ and must suffer the consequences.* It is, indeed, the Holy Spirit, not the congregations, who creates Bishops and Deacons. The Spirit grants the qualifications, both natural and acquired; and, speaking to the congregations through the written oracles, commands their ordination or appointment to the work.

In the current administration of the Kingdom of God, *faith is the* **principle**, *and ordinances are the* **means** *of all spiritual enjoyment.* Without faith in the testimony of God, a person is without God, without Christ, and without hope in the world. A Christless universe, regarding spiritual life and joy, is the most complete absence of substance that imagination can conjure. Without faith, nothing in the Bible can be appreciated; and without it, there is for man no Kingdom of Heaven in all of God’s domains.

In the kingdom of nature, *sense* is the *principle,* and *ordinances* are the *means* of enjoyment. Without sense or sensation, nothing in nature can be known or enjoyed. All the creative, restorative, and renewing power, wisdom, and goodness of God displayed in nature are found in ordinances. The sun, moon, and stars — the clouds, the air, the water, the seasons, day and night — are thus called the *ordinances* of heaven because God’s power, wisdom, and goodness are *in* them, and felt by us only *through* them. Now, sense without the ordinances of nature, like faith without the ordinances of religion, would be no *principle* of enjoyment; and the ordinances of nature, without sense, would provide no *means* for enjoyment. These are the unalterable decrees of God. There is no exception to them; and there can be no turning back from them. To illustrate and enforce the doctrine of this single paragraph would merit a volume. The essence, the entirety of that reformation for which we contend, is encapsulated in this decree as stated above. If it is true, the ground on which we stand is as solid and unchanging as the Rock of Ages; if it is false, we build on sand. *Reader, examine it closely!*

In the Kingdom of Heaven, faith is therefore the *principle,* and ordinances are the *means* of enjoyment; because all the wisdom, power, love, mercy, compassion, or *grace of God* is contained in the ordinances of the Kingdom of Heaven; and if all grace resides in them, it can only be conveyed through them. What, then, are the ordinances that contain the grace of God under the present administration of the Kingdom of Heaven? They include preaching the gospel — immersion in the name of Jesus, into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit — the reading and teaching the Living Oracles — the Lord’s day — the Lord’s Supper — fasting — prayer — confession of sins — and praise. Other appointments of God may also be included, such as exhortation, admonition, discipline, etc.: for these, too, are ordinances of God; indeed, all statutes and commands are ordinances. However, we are not presently discussing those ordinances which pertain to the good order of the Kingdom but rather those which are primary means of enjoyment. These foundational and sacred ordinances of the Kingdom of Heaven are vital to our individual enjoyment of God’s present salvation.

Without the sun, there is no solar influence; without the moon, there is no lunar influence; without the stars, there is no sidereal influence; without the clouds, there can be no rain; and without the ordinances of the Kingdom of Heaven, there can be no heavenly influence exhibited or felt. There is a unique and distinguishing influence exerted by the sun, moon, and stars; yet they all provide light. Thus, in the ordinances of the Kingdom of Heaven — while they all work to create similar effects on the subjects of the kingdom, each one has something distinctive and special that prevents any one from substituting for another. Not one of them can be overlooked; they are all critical to fully enjoying the Reign of Heaven.

In nature and in religion, all the blessings of God bestowed upon humanity can be categorized into two groups. For illustrative purposes, these may be termed *antecedent* and *consequent.* The antecedents include all those blessings given to humanity to prepare them for action and to encourage them to act. The consequents are those blessings which God grants to humanity through a course of action that corresponds to these antecedent blessings. For instance, all that God did for Adam in creating for him the earth and all its contents, animal, vegetable, mineral; in forming him in His own image; in granting him all his physical, intellectual, and moral abilities, and in endowing him with all personal and real property which elevated him above all beings of this world, were antecedent to any actions Adam took; these endowed him with motivations to love, honor, and obey his Creator and Benefactor. All that God did for Abraham through promises and precepts before his obedience — all that He did for the Israelites in liberating them from Egypt and redeeming them from Pharaoh’s tyranny, were all antecedent to the duties and observances He prescribed to them. And all the blessings that Adam, Abraham, and the Israelites experienced through complying with the institutions under which they were placed were consequences of that state of mind and behavior which the preceding favors required and prompted. *God never required any being to do anything without granting power and motives derived from something He had done for them.*

In the Kingdom of Heaven, the antecedent blessings are the constitution of grace, the King, and all that He did, suffered, and endured for our salvation. These were accomplished before we entered into action. This is all grace, pure grace — sovereign grace: for there can be no grace that is not free and sovereign. But the forgiveness of our sins, our adoption into God’s family, and our status as heirs of the kingdom of glory are dependent on faith and the obedience of faith.

Organization and life of any kind are necessarily gifts from God; however, health and the ongoing enjoyment of life and its numerous blessings are outcomes of proper exercise of these gifts. He who will not breathe, eat, drink, sleep, or exercise cannot enjoy animal life. God bestowed animal organization and life before any action of the living creature; yet the creature may forfeit that life by neglecting to maintain it through the necessary means for its survival and comfort.

God created one man from the earth, and one earthly *nature* of every sort, through a positive, direct, immediate agency of wisdom, power, and goodness. He granted them the ability, according to His own design or *system* of nature, to reproduce and multiply indefinitely. However, this life is transmitted, disseminated, and sustained by God operating through nature's system. Likewise, Jesus in the new creation, through His Spirit sent down from heaven after His glorification, did through a positive, direct, and immediate agency, create one congregation, one mystical or spiritual body; and, in accordance with the Kingdom of Heaven’s constitution or system, did give that mystical body, originally established in Jerusalem from the ancient earthly Kingdom of God, the power to reproduce and proliferate indefinitely. Yet this new spiritual life is conveyed, spread, and sustained by the Spirit of God, working through the constitution or system of grace ordained in the Kingdom of Heaven.

Thus, in establishing the Kingdom of Heaven, as in the establishment of the kingdom of nature, there was a display of divinity, compared to all subsequent events, that was properly supernatural. Hence the gathering of Apostles, prophets, extraordinary teachers, gifts, powers, miracles, etc. But after this new mystical body of Christ was created, it had, and still has, the power of multiplying and replenishing the whole earth, *and will do so;* for just as God breathed into Adam’s nostrils the spirit of life after raising him from the dust, and as He endowed His beloved Son Jesus with the Holy Spirit without measure after He rose from the water; so too did Jesus breathe His Holy Spirit into the formation of the first congregation, figuratively called the *body of Christ,* to animate and reside within it until His return. The only temple and dwelling on earth, since Jesus pronounced desolation upon the one in Jerusalem, is the body of Christ.

Now, the first congregation of Christ, filled with the Spirit of God, had the power to raise other congregations of Christ; or, what is the same thing, of enabling the body of Christ to grow and multiply. Thus we see that other congregations were soon established in Judea and Samaria by the members of the congregation in Jerusalem. Many were spiritual children of God through the Spirit of God, facilitated by the members of the first congregation. Since the Spirit ceased to operate in all those magnificent displays of supernatural grandeur, He continues to remind the disciples of Christ of the teachings spoken by the holy Apostles, and through all the reasons derived from the previous blessings bestowed, He works in them both to will and to do according to the will of God, causing the body of Christ to grow and increase not only in *stature,* but also in knowledge and favor of God. Consequently, the church of Christ, filled with His Spirit, and possessing the oracles and ordinances of the Reign of Heaven, is fully equipped for the conversion of the entire world, provided she does not betray her Lord.

In the work of conversion, her Evangelists, or those sent beyond the confines of her weekly gatherings, must, under the influence of the Spirit of God, simply propose the constitution or the good news of the Reign to those outside; and using all arguments supported by the oracles of God, along with circumstances and occasions, they plead and urge people to reconcile with God, to kiss the Son, to accept the constitution, and to submit to Him who is ordained a Prince and a Savior to grant repentance and forgiveness of sins to all who yield to His rule. Thus, both they and the congregation who sends them out and supports them in their work father spiritual children to God through the gospel, thereby extending the body of Christ.

With all these documents before us, can we not say that, as Eve was the mother of all living, so "Jerusalem is the mother of us all?" Thus, to use Paul’s language, "Men are born of God through the gospel" via the efforts of the congregations of Christ.

Under the present administration of the Kingdom of Heaven, a significant apostasy has occurred, as predicted by the Apostles. Just as the church, compared to a city, is referred to as "Mount Zion," the apostate church is called "Babylon the Great." Much like the type of Babylon, "Mystery Babylon" the antitype, is destined to face destruction by a Cyrus who does not know God. She will fall by the sword of unbelievers, supported by God's fierce judgments. "The Holy City" continues to be trampled underfoot, and the sanctuary is rife with corruption. Indeed, it has become a den of thieves; but mighty is the Lord who judges the apostate city. Until that great and notable day of the Lord arrives, we cannot, based on prophetic scripture, expect a universal return to the original gospel, nor a general restoration of all the institutions of the Kingdom of Heaven in their primitive form; and consequently, we cannot look forward to the universal subjugation of the nations under the scepter of Jesus.

However, were we to delve into the administration of the affairs of the kingdom following the fall and overthrow of the apostate city, along with the conversion of the Jews, we would embark on a vast and tumultuous sea, for which our small vessel is not adequately equipped at this moment. This may yet warrant the construction of a larger vessel at a more opportune time. Meanwhile, the original gospel is preached widely, and many thousands are preparing for the day of the Lord; these are taught by the "Faithful and True Witness" that the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, and that their happiness and security alike lie in being prepared for His second coming.

1. These essays do not appear in the order in which they were written and published. We place the last-written first; because, in the natural order of things, general views of the nature of the Christian kingdom ought to precede the special development of its peculiar institutions. They first appeared in the form of *extras* to the regular series of the Millennial Harbinger; and as we deemed it necessary to preserve them as much as possible in their original form, this will explain several repetitions that may appear.

`  `All the leading and characteristic principles of that reformation for which we advocate, as far as the gospel institution is concerned, may be gleaned from them. Much of the evidence supporting some of the propositions found in these essays is scattered across several volumes; but such a miniature overview of the evidence by which they are supported, as is often sufficient for the reader's conviction, will be found embodied within. Those, however, who may not be entirely satisfied with the arguments presented must look to the various discussions of these principles found in the Christian Baptist and Millennial Harbinger.

13. If the following passages are carefully examined and compared, it will be evident that both phrases often indicate the same thing: Matt. 3:2. Mark 1:14. Luke 4:43. — Matt. 13:11. Mark 4:11. Luke 8:10, — Matt. 11:11. Luke 7:28. To these three distinct pieces of evidence, many more could be added. What Matthew calls "the Kingdom of *Heaven,*" Mark and Luke refer to as "the Kingdom of *God.*"

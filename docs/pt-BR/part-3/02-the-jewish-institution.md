# 2. The Jewish Institution

In this age of improvement of divine institutions, we read and hear much of "two dispensations of the covenant of grace," thus making the Jewish and the Christian institutions dispensations of one "covenant of grace." Why not include the patriarchal, (which is even more venerable for its antiquity and lasted a thousand years longer than the Jewish), as also a dispensation of the covenant of grace? Then we would have had *three* dispensations of one covenant. This is merely a "*show* of wisdom." The Holy Spirit refers to them as "two covenants," or "two institutions," and not as two modifications of one covenant; and it speaks of each as established upon promises. The Jewish covenant was established upon temporal and earthly promises, contained in the first promise made to Abraham; but the new covenant, says Paul, "is established upon *better promises*," stemming from that concerning *the blessing of the nations* in the promised seed.

The Jewish institution began and continued for about 1500 years before the Reign of Heaven commenced. It was not a replacement for family worship but an addition to it; however, it did affect the patriarchal institution in some respects, particularly regarding the single family of Abraham. The individual families of the Jewish nation, *as such,* continued their family worship — the worship of God was still heard in the homes of the righteous; and like Joshua, every good Israelite said, "As for me and my family, we will serve the Lord."

In four hundred years, the family of Abraham had, through the line of Isaac and Jacob, fulfilling the first promise, grown into millions. No less than two million people came up out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses. The heavenly Father, in the progressive development of his plan to bless all nations, left the entire world under the institution of family worship, and formed the whole progeny of Abraham that came up out of Egypt into one great national institution. He condescended to appear as the *King of the Jews* and to make them a *kingdom of God,* as a preparation for the appearance of his *Son,* who is predestined to be the King of the whole earth, with a kingdom that will ultimately embrace all the nations of the world.

The twelve tribes were organized into one large worshipping family, presenting their united worship to God through the common High Priest. This led to the construction of one public house consecrated to the Lord, serving as a place of gathering for their social and national identity. A political, moral, and religious constitution was presented to the people; and upon its adoption, they became the covenanted people of God. This constitutional kingdom was founded on precepts and promises; its worship, when fully developed, was merely an extension of family worship adapted to one large national family. They had one king, one high priest, one national altar, one national house of God, one morning and evening service, one great national sacrifice, and one great annual atonement. The nation was essentially a family of families, and everything that applied to a single family in its family worship was expanded and adapted to this great confederate family.

Various mystic and significant institutions set this nation apart from all others; one principal objective of its institution was to keep its subjects separate and distinct from all other peoples until the Messiah (the promised seed) should come. Another goal was to depict, through appropriate types, the spiritual worship of the kingdom of heaven and to showcase the great doctrines of faith, repentance, remission, adoption, and inheritance through vivid images, ingeniously crafted to represent the entire doctrine of reconciliation and sanctification to God.

The Jewish institution should not only be regarded in its political, moral, and religious aspects, but especially in its figurative and prospective character. God, in his wisdom and benevolence, designed it so that its entire history — the fates and fortunes of its subjects from their descent into Egypt, their journey to Canaan, and their settlement in the land of promise — along with their fortunes in that land up to their final downfall, would clearly and impressively foreshadow the new institution and the fates and fortunes of the subjects of this new and more glorious order of things. "All these things happened to them for *types*," (examples), says Paul, "and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world have come." The same great commentator on this institution not only presents the history of its subjects as instructive to the citizens of the new institution but also mentions the tabernacle, saying, "It was a figurative representation for the time then present," and that its furnishings were "the patterns of things in the heavens." "The law," he adds, "contained only a shadow of the good things to come." A shadow, indeed, produced by a man, a house, or a tree, is not and cannot be an exact image or representation of them; yet, when elucidated through a verbal description, it greatly facilitates an easy and accurate understanding of them.

The old testament is so replete with the doctrine of the new institution that we find all the Apostles and Christian writers unceremoniously applying everything they quote from the law, the prophets, and the psalms, to the Messiah, his kingdom, and the fortunes of his people, as if the Jewish writings had no other purpose than to unfold the kingdom of heaven. Jesus begins with Abraham, who saw his day on Mount Moriah in the typical resurrection of Isaac. Paul views Hagar, Ishmael, Sarah, and Isaac as the best illustration of the *two institutions,* while John concludes with the description of the descent of Jerusalem from heaven.

Therefore, anyone wishing to accurately understand the Christian institution must approach it through the Mosaic; and one who wishes to be proficient in the Jewish must make Paul his commentator. While the mere politician, moralist, or religionist may contemplate one without the other, though he may find much to admire in both, he will never truly understand either. A veil, as thick as that which concealed the glory of Moses' face from the Israelites, will obscure the glory of the Jewish and Christian institutions from his view.

Not only did the tabernacle, the temple, their furnishings, the services of both, the priests, the sacrifices, the festivals, the convocations, and all the ordinances of that Ritual take on a picturesque and figurative character, but nearly all the illustrious and highly distinguished figures of that institution were made prophetic or typical of the Messiah or of the major incidents of his life, sufferings, triumphs, and the significant affairs of his governance. Among the *persons* from the patriarchal and Jewish ages who in one or more prominent roles or incidents, or in their general history mirrored the Messiah and his reign, the following group stands out: — Adam, Abel, Noah, Melchizedek, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Samson, David, and Jonah. Among the *things* that are equally figurative and instructive are the visions of Jacob's ladder — the burning bush — the pillar of cloud and fire — the manna — the rock at Horeb, a fountain of living water in the wilderness — the veil of Moses — the brazen serpent — the victory over the nations of Canaan, and the land of Canaan itself. And among the *ordinances,* we find the Passover, the scapegoat, the red heifer, the year of jubilee, the law of the leper, the kinsman redeemer, the cities of refuge; along with all the sacrifices, washings, anointings, and consecrations of the *holy* nation.

Yet another vital objective of the Jewish institution, crucial for the world, was to provide a new alphabet and language (the elements of heavenly knowledge), without which it would seem almost, if not entirely, impossible to comprehend the spiritual matters or to gain any proficiency in the knowledge of the relationships that Christianity reveals. The language of the new institution is thereby explained by that of the old. No one can comprehend the dialect of the kingdom of heaven without having studied the dialect of the prior administrations of heaven over the patriarchs and Jews. The most striking and characteristic attribute of the sacred dialect is that its elements are composed of historical incidents or what we refer to as *remarkable providences.*

I cannot explain myself better or provide my readers with a more essential service than by illustrating through an actual detail of sacred history the following proposition: — *That sacred history, or the remarkable instances of God's providence to the Jews and Patriarchs, form the foundation of the sacred dialect of the new institution.* Alternatively, if the reader prefers, it can be expressed as — *All the leading words and phrases of the New Testament are to be explained and understood through the history of the Jewish nation and God's governance of them.* Here is a mere sample:

God *called* Abram out of Ur and changed his name to *Abraham*; and the name of his wife Sarai was changed to *Sarah.* He *promised* Isaac as the individual in whom his *seed* should be *called.* God did *test* Abraham, commanding him to *offer* Isaac as a burnt offering — Isaac had two sons — Esau the elder and Jacob the younger. Esau *despised* his *birthright* and *sold* it to Jacob. Jacob wrestled with God and *prevailed*; he received a blessing and was thus called *Israel.* He had *twelve* sons: Joseph was his favorite. His brothers *envied* him and *sold* him for twenty pieces of silver. Joseph *found favor* in the eyes of his master. *The Lord was with Joseph.* He was cast into prison, and from there he was elevated to the *governor* of Egypt under Pharaoh. A famine in Canaan compelled Jacob and his sons to go to Egypt for bread, and Joseph was *revealed* to his brothers. Joseph died in Egypt and left his father's house in the land. They multiplied exceedingly, and the Egyptians greatly *afflicted* and *oppressed* the Israelites. *Moses* was born and exposed: Pharaoh's daughter found him and *adopted* him as a son. Moses fled into Midian and married the daughter of the priest or prince of Midian, tending his father-in-law's flock in the *desert* and came to Horeb, *the mountain of God.* The Lord appeared to him in *a flame of fire* in a bush. The bush burned and was not consumed. Moses *drew near,* and then for the first time stood on *holy ground.* God *sent* him to Egypt to lead *his* people out of *bondage.*

God instructed him to say to the *children of Israel,* "**I am** has sent me to you. Gather the *elders* of Israel and say to them, *The Lord God* of your fathers, the God of Abraham, etc. 'has sent me to you. I will *smite* Egypt with my *wonders,* and *bring you up out of the afflictions* of Egypt. Tell Pharaoh, Israel is *my son — my firstborn.* Take Aaron with you, and you shall *put words into his mouth*; and I will be *with your mouth* and with his mouth: he shall be to you instead of a mouth, and you shall be to him *instead of God.* Take your *rod* in your hand. The Lord *sent* Aaron to Moses: he met him in the mountain and *kissed* him. And the Lord *visited* his people. And the people *believed when they heard* that the Lord had *looked upon* their affliction. Pharaoh oppressed them even more. The Lord said, with a *strong hand* he will let them go. I will *redeem* them with an outstretched arm and with great *judgments.* I will give you Canaan for a *heritage*; I will take you for myself as *a people. I will be your God.*

Moses said, I am a man of *uncircumcised lips,* and how shall Pharaoh *listen* to me? I have made you a *god* to Pharaoh, and Aaron *your prophet.* I will multiply my *signs* and bring out *my people,* and *harden* Pharaoh's heart. When he says, "Show me a miracle," cast your rod before him, and *it shall become* a serpent. Still, Pharaoh refused and *hardened his heart.* The magicians overcame with the *signs* said, *This is the finger of God.* The *God of the Hebrews* said, "Let *my people go.* I have *raised* you up (like a lion) to demonstrate my power in you and to make *my name known* throughout *all the earth.* The Lord struck down all the *firstborn* of Egypt after he had *plagued* them severely. Pharaoh commanded them to depart; but he pursued them to the Red Sea. Israel despaired at the sight before and behind them. Moses said, "Stand still and see *the salvation of God.*" The sea was divided. Covered with a cloud, Israel marched through as on dry ground. The waters stood on either side like a wall. Pharaoh pursued with his chariots and horsemen, but the waters returned, and they were drowned. Thus the Lord *redeemed, saved, delivered,* and brought Israel out of bondage.*

After this deliverance, Moses and the children of Israel sang, "The Lord has become *my salvation*; he is *my God.* You have overthrown those who *rose up against you.* You have *led your people* whom you *have redeemed.* You *have guided them* in your strength to your *holy habitation.* The inhabitants of Canaan will remain still as a stone until *your people* pass over, O Lord, the people *you have purchased.* You will plant them in the mountain of *your inheritance*; in the *sanctuary* which *your hands* have established."

They entered *the wilderness of Sin.* They cried for bread, and God *rained bread from heaven upon them,* to *prove* whether or not they would *walk in his law,* and they ate manna for forty years until they reached the borders of Canaan.

They complained about the lack of water and tempted God. Moses *struck the rock* at Horeb, and water gushed out. But Moses was angry and struck the rock twice, and he and Aaron thus *rebelled* against God and fell in the wilderness. The Lord made a covenant with the whole nation at Sinai, making them a *special treasure* above all peoples — a *kingdom of priests*, a *holy nation*; and God *spoke* all the words of the law, written on two tablets of stone; and *spoke to Israel from heaven.*

The Lord, through Moses, gave them directions for building a *tabernacle* and a pattern for all its furniture. And as *a ransom for his soul,* every man, rich and poor, was to pay half a shekel as an *offering to the Lord* to *make atonement* for his soul; and it was given for *the service* of the tabernacle. When the tabernacle was constructed and completed, *the glory of the Lord* filled the tabernacle, and the *cloud* covered it. When the cloud *was lifted,* they journeyed; but until it was lifted, they did not move. The *cloud* was over the tabernacle by day, and *fire* was upon it by night, in the sight of all Israel throughout all their journeys.

Before Moses died, he *laid his hands* upon Joshua and gave him a *charge* as the *Lord commanded*; and thus honored him so that the children of Israel might be *obedient* to him as their *leader.* "As I was *with Moses,* so will I be *with you*," says God: "I will not fail you nor *forsake* you."

If we could continue with the history of this people and include their religious institutions, we would uncover the true meaning of the sacred style of the New Testament with more accuracy and certainty than from all the commentators of ancient and modern times. This overview must suffice for our current purpose.

From the information now before us, the specifications of the outlines of the Sinaitic and national institutions, and the terms and phrases found in the history of this people, we can discover in what *relation* they stood to God, and what *favors* He bestowed upon them in that relation.

They were *called* and *chosen,* or the *elect* of God as a nation. As such, they were *delivered, saved, bought,* or *purchased,* and *redeemed.* God is said to have *created, made, formed,* and *begotten* them. As such, He is called their *Father,* their *God,* their *Redeemer,* their *King,* their *Savior,* their *Salvation*; and they are called His *children, sons* and *daughters; born to Him,* His *house, people, inheritance, family, servants.*

As a *chartered* and gathered people, they are referred to as *the city, the holy city, the city of the Lord, Jerusalem, Zion, Mount Zion, the city of David.* Other nations, in contrast with them, are called *not a people, aliens, strangers, enemies, far off, unclean.*

Various similarities expressive of the close relationship they maintained with God are also found within the ancient institutions — such as *husband* and *wife, shepherd* and *flock, vine* and *vineyard, mother* and *children.* They are described as being *written* or *enrolled* in *the book of God*; to be *planted, washed, sanctified, clean, separated to God*; they are labeled *the house, building, sanctuary, dwelling place* of God; *a kingdom of priests, a holy nation, a peculiar people, saints,* etc.

Those who are keen to trace these descriptions of the relationship and privileges of this ancient kingdom of God would do well (in addition to the verses cited from their history from Egypt to the Jordan) to examine the following passages: — Exodus 14:30; 15:16; 19:6; Deut. 4:37; 7:6; 10:15; 14:1; 1:31; 7:5; 32:6; 32:18-19; 18:7; 3:18, 20; 12:9. 1 Kings 3:8. Psalm 105:6; 33:13; 105:43; 106:5, 21; 124:2; 149:2. Isa 41:8-9, 43:1, 3, 5, 7; 51:2, 4. Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Psalms of David throughout, etc.

Unless we write a full treatise on these prior institutions, we cannot properly delve further into details. The outlines, as far as they pertain to the subject of this essay, are now before the reader; and with this groundwork, we shall now invite his attention to **the kingdom of heaven.**

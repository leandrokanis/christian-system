# Proposition 4

***All Christians are members of the house or family of God, are called and constituted a holy and a royal priesthood, and may, therefore, bless God for the Lord's table, its loaf, and cup — approach it without fear and partake of it with joy as often as they please, in remembrance of the death of their Lord and Savior.***

We will sustain the different clauses of this proposition in order — '*all Christians are members of the family or house of God:*'

'But Christ is trusted as a Son over *his own family;* whose family we are, provided we maintain our profession and hope unshaken to the end;' — '*are called and constituted a holy and a royal priesthood.*' You, also, as living stones, are being built up into a spiritual temple, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices most acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.' In the 9th verse of the same chapter, it says, 'But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood;' and this is addressed to all the brethren scattered in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.

May not, then, *holy* and *royal* priests thank God for the Lord's table, its loaf, and cup of wine? May they not, without a *human* priest to consecrate the way for them, approach the Lord's table and handle the loaf and cup? If the common priests did not fear to approach a golden table and to place upon it the loaves of the presence; if they did not fear to take and eat the consecrated bread, because they were priests according to the flesh — shall royal priests fear, without the intervention of human hands, to approach the Lord's table and to partake of one loaf? If they do, they do not know how to appreciate the consecration of Jesus, nor how to value their high calling and exalted designation as kings and priests to God. And may we not say that he who is invested with a little clerical authority, derived only from 'the Man of Sin and Son of Perdition,' if borrowed from the Romanists, says to them, 'stand by, I am holier than you' — may we not say that such a one is worse than Diotrephes, who sought a pre-eminence, because he desecrates the royal priesthood of Jesus Christ, and calls common and unclean those consecrated by the blood of the Son of God? Such impiety can only be found among those who worship the beast and who have covenanted and agreed that none shall buy or sell, except those who receive a mark on their foreheads and letters patent in their hands. But allow common sense to whisper a word into the ears of priests' "laymen," but Christ's '*royal priests.*' Do you not thank God for the cup while the priest stands by the table; and do you not handle the loaf and cup when they come to you? And would not your thanksgiving have been as acceptable, if the human mediator had not been there, and your participation as well pleasing to God and as comforting to yourself, if you had been the first to handle the loaf or the cup, as when you are the second or the fifty-second in line? Let reason answer these two questions and see what comes of the haughty assumptions of your Protestant clergy!! But this is just a side note.

I trust it is clear that the royal priesthood may approach the Lord's table *without fear,* as they are consecrated to officiate by a blood far superior to that which consecrated the fleshly priesthood, just as the Lord's table, covered with the sacred emblems of the sacrifice of the Lord himself, is superior to the table which held only the twelve loaves of the presence; and as they are, at the very least, called by a holy and divine election, and are a *chosen race* of priests, just as those descended from the loins of Levi.

# Proposition 7

***The breaking of one loaf and the joint participation in the cup of the Lord, in commemoration of the Lord's death, commonly referred to as "the Lord's Supper," is an established part of the worship and edification of all Christian congregations in all their stated meetings.***

**Argument 1.** The first Christian congregation that gathered in Jerusalem, constituted by the twelve Apostles, attended the breaking of the loaf in their public meetings as regularly as they did any other aspect of Christian worship. As Luke records in Acts 2:42, "They continued steadfastly in the Apostles' doctrine, in fellowship, in *the breaking of the loaf,* and in prayers." Should we not also remain steadfast in the breaking of the loaf, just as we do in the teaching of the Apostles, in fellowship, and in the prayers commanded by the Apostles?

**Argument 2.** The Apostles instructed the churches to observe all that the Lord commanded. Therefore, whatever the churches did with the appointment or agreement of the Apostles was done under the command of Jesus Christ. Every religious act that the Apostles taught and sanctioned in one Christian congregation was sanctioned for all Christian congregations, as they were all under the same governance of one King. The church in Troas met on the first day of the week, thus implying that all churches gathered on the first day of the week for religious purposes.

Among the acts of worship, or the institutions of the Lord, that the disciples engaged in during these meetings, the breaking of the loaf was so significant and important that the churches are said to come together on the first day of the week for this purpose. We are specifically told that the disciples in Troas gathered for this reason. What one church did under the authority of the Lord, as part of His instituted worship, all churches did. It is not a matter of inference that the disciples in Troas met for this purpose; Luke states explicitly in Acts 20:7, "And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together for the breaking of the loaf, Paul, intending to depart the next day, spoke with them and continued his message until midnight." From the way in which this meeting of the disciples at Troas is described by the historian, two things are very clear — 1st. That it was an established custom or rule for the disciples to meet on the first day of the week. 2nd. That the primary objective of their meeting was to break the loaf. Those who object to breaking the loaf every first day when the disciples are assembled typically begin their objections by noting that Luke does not say they broke the loaf *every* first day; yet they argue against the Sabbatarians that it should be observed *every* first day in commemoration of His resurrection. The Sabbatarians raise the same objection to this passage when cited by Christian believers to justify the weekly observance of the first day. They argue that Luke does not tell us that they met for any religious purpose on *every* first day. How inconsistent, then, are those who use this sentence as a direct precedent for observing *every* first day when arguing against the Sabbatarians, and then turn around and claim that it does not establish that they broke the loaf *every* first day! If it doesn’t prove one, it is clear it cannot prove the other; for the weekly observance of this day, as a day of gathering for the disciples, and the weekly breaking of the loaf in those meetings, are interconnected. Let us reiterate: "And on the first day of the week, when the disciples assembled to break the loaf." Anyone who values the meaning of words must admit that the gathering of the disciples and the breaking of the loaf, according to these terms, are expressed as equally frequent events. If one occurred *fifty-two* times a year or just *once,* so did the other. If they met every first day, they broke the loaf every first day; and if they did not break the loaf every first day, they did not meet every first day. 

In Greek and English, the definite article is used before established fixed times, and its presence here does not merely refer to one day, but indicates a specific or set day. This is consistent across all languages that have a definite article. Let’s illustrate this with a straightforward example. Suppose 500 or 1000 years into the future the annual observance of July 4th had ceased for several centuries, and some individual or individuals committed to the primitive institutions of this great Republic wanted to see the 4th of July observed as it was by the founders during the early days of the Republic. Suppose that none of the records from the first century of this Republic explicitly stated that it was a regular and established practice for a certain group of citizens to honor the 4th day of every July; yet a few incidental references in the biographies of the Republic’s leading figures spoke of it as Luke described the gathering in Troas. How would the situation be handled? For instance, in the biography of John Quincy Adams it states, A.D. 1823, "And on the 4th of July, when the republicans of the city of Washington gathered to dine, John Q. Adams delivered an oration to them." Would not an American a thousand years from now, under such circumstances, find in these words *one* piece of evidence that it was an established tradition during the first century of this Republic to regard the 4th of July as such? He would point out that it was not stated that it was on *a* fourth of July, as though it were a singular occurrence; but rather, it was conveyed—according to the fixed meaning of the English language—as a specific and established day of unique observance. At the very least, he could not fail to convince even the most ignorant that the primary purpose of that gathering was *to dine.* Regardless of how frequently that dinner occurred, it must be acknowledged based on the words cited that they *met to dine.*

Another point that may confuse the Sabbatarians and those who observe the breaking of the loaf without due regard can easily be inferred from Luke's account. Paul and his company arrived in Troas either on the evening of the first day or early Monday morning; for we know he left early Monday morning. It is specifically stated that he stayed only seven days in Troas. Now, had the disciples been Sabbatarians, or observed the seventh day as a Sabbath, and broken the loaf as the Sabbatarians do, they would not have postponed their meeting until the first day, keeping Paul and his company waiting when he was clearly in a hurry. His staying *seven* days and early departure on Monday morning supports the evidence that the first day of the week was the *fixed* and *established* time for the disciples to gather for this purpose. 

From Acts 2, we learn that *the breaking of the loaf* was a consistent part of the disciples’ worship in their gatherings. And from Acts 20, we learn that the first day of the week was the established time for those gatherings. Most importantly, we must observe that the central purpose of their meetings was to break the loaf. Other supporting evidence of the disciples’ regular meeting on the first day for religious purposes includes Paul's instruction to all the congregations in Galatia, as well as that in Corinth, to engage in fellowship, or setting aside contributions for the poor saints, on the first day of every week. "On the first day of *every week,* let each of you set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, so that when I come no collections will have to be made." 

*Kata mian Sabbaton* is appropriately translated by Macknight as "*the first day of every week;*" for linguists will agree that *kata polin* means every city; *kata menan,* every month; *kata ecclesian,* every church; and therefore, in the same usage, *kata mian Sabbaton* means the first day of every week.

Now this lays the foundation for asserting not only that the disciples in Troas gathered on the first day of every week for "the breaking of the loaf," but also for presenting a third argument: —

**Argument 3.** The congregation in Corinth met every first day, or the first day of every week, to show forth the Lord's death. The reader should remember that Paul instructed the church in Corinth, or every saint in Corinth, to contribute according to his means, setting aside his contributions in the treasury every first day to avoid collections when he arrived. This is universally acknowledged to support the claim of the saints meeting weekly. Now, keeping this concession in mind, we only have to look at what is mentioned in chapter 11:20. "When you come together in one place, that is, at least every week, *this is not to eat the Lord's Supper.*" Acting this way is unworthy of the purpose of your meeting. Acting this way is not to eat the Lord's Supper. It is not to show forth the Lord's death. This affirms that this is the main objective of the gathering. When a teacher reprimands his students for wasting time, he cannot drive home the purpose of coming to class more effectively than by saying, "When you act this way, this is not to gather to learn." This is exactly the meaning of the Apostle's statement, "When you gather like this, it is *not* to eat the Lord's Supper." Thus, we have seen that the saints met every first day in Corinth; and when they gathered in one place, it was to eat the Lord's Supper, a declaration of the practices of the early congregations as clear as could be expressed incidentally, differing only from a direct command in how it is articulated. It is universally accepted that whatever the congregations did with the Apostles' approval, they did with their authority. The Apostles provided them with all the Christian institutions. Now since Apostle Paul approved their gathering every week and their coming together in one location to show forth the Lord's death—and only reproached them for straying from the meaning of the institution—this carries as much authority as we could desire for the weekly meetings of the disciples.

However, when Acts 2:42; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 11:20; and chap. 16:1 & 2 are compared and combined, it becomes evident that we act under the guidance of apostolic teaching and precedent when we meet every Lord's Day for the breaking of the loaf. This is further confirmed by a fourth argument drawn from the following fact: —

**Argument 4.** *No example can be found in the New Testament of any Christian congregation assembling on the first day of the week, except for the breaking of the loaf.* Let those who teach that Christians should meet on the first day of the week for reasons other than breaking the loaf present an example, and only then can they contest the fact stated above. Until this is done, denying it must seem utterly pointless. Therefore, the argument is, Christians have no authority, nor are they obligated to meet on the Lord's Day, from anything the Apostles said or practiced, unless it is to declare the Lord's death and to engage in those means of edification and comfort associated with it.

**Argument 5.** If it is not the duty and privilege of every Christian congregation to gather on the first day of every week to show forth the Lord's death, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to demonstrate from either scripture or reason that it is their duty or privilege to meet monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually, or indeed, at all, for this purpose. For from what premises could anyone argue that it is a duty or privilege to gather monthly that would not also prove it is obligatory to meet weekly? We challenge scrutiny here and assert that no one can produce a single reason why it should or could be a duty or privilege for a congregation to meet monthly, quarterly, or annually, that would not also confirm it is their duty and privilege to gather every first day for this purpose.

**Argument 6.** Spiritual health, like physical health, depends on nourishment. For physical well-being, food must not only be wholesome in nature and sufficient in quantity, but it must also be received at proper intervals, which are regular and fixed. Is it different for spiritual health? Is there no analogy between the bread that perishes and the Bread of Life? Is there no analogy between physical and spiritual life—between physical and spiritual health? If such an analogy exists, does it not follow that if the early disciples enjoyed good spiritual health by gathering weekly to show forth the Lord's death, they cannot experience good spiritual health if they only meet quarterly or semi-annually for this purpose?

**Argument 7.** Finally, what *commemorative* institution, in any age and under any religious system, was established by divine authority without a fixed time for its observance? Was it the commemoration of the completion of creation symbolized in the weekly Sabbath? Was it the Passover, the Pentecost, the Feast of Tabernacles? Was it the Feast of Purim? What other significant practice was there, whose times or occasions of observance were not fixed? How often was circumcision to be performed on the same subject? How often was Christian baptism? Is there a single commemorative institution the meaning or frequency of which is not clearly defined in the Holy Scriptures by precept or example? Not one of a *social* nature, and scarcely one of an individual nature. The commemoration of the Lord's death must be a weekly institution—a practice in all the meetings of the disciples for Christian worship; or it must be an anomaly—something *sui generis*—an institution that is unlike any other of divine origin. And can anyone tell why Christians should celebrate the Lord's resurrection *fifty-two* times a year, but only commemorate His death *once, twice,* or *twelve* times? Whoever can do this will surely possess a vivid imagination, regardless of how defective their judgment may be or how little they are acquainted with the New Testament.

# Proposition 3

***On the Lord's Table There Is Necessarily Only One Loaf***

The necessity is not that of a positive law mandating one loaf and only one, as the ritual of Moses mandated twelve loaves. Rather, it is a necessity arising from the meaning of the Institution as explained by the Apostles. Just as there is one literal body and one mystical or figurative body that has many members, there must be only one loaf. The Apostle emphasizes this, stating, "Because there is one loaf, we, the many, are one body; for we are all partakers of that one loaf."<sup>8</sup> According to Dr. Macknight, the Greek word *artos*, especially when paired with numerical words, always signifies *a loaf*, and it is translated as such in our Bibles: "Do you not remember the *five loaves?*"<sup>9</sup> There are many similar instances. Dr. Campbell asserts that when in the plural form, it should always be rendered loaves; however, when a numeral precedes it, it must be rendered as a loaf or loaves. Thus we say one loaf, seven loaves; not one bread, seven breads. "Because there is one loaf," says Paul, we must view the entire congregation as one body. Here the Apostle reasons from what is more clear to what is less clear; from what was established to what was not as fully established in the minds of the Corinthians. There was no dispute about the one loaf; therefore, there should be none about the one body. This mode of reasoning makes it as certain as a positive law: because what an Apostle reasons from must be an established fact or a well-founded principle. To have argued from an assumption or a contingency to establish the unity of the body of Christ would have been absurd for a logician, and how unworthy of an Apostle! It was, therefore, an established institution that there is only one loaf, as the Apostle supports his argument by referencing an established fact. Our third proposition is thus upheld: *on the Lord's table there is necessarily only one loaf*.

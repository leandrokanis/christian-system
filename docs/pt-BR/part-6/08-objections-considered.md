# Objections Considered

Having previously written extensively on this subject, I will now introduce a few notable individuals from the many distinguished figures who, since the Reformation, have advocated for this cause. We will not only present them to our readers, but we will also allow them to speak for themselves. —

**John Brown**, of Haddington, author of the Dictionary of the Bible, and teacher of theology for that branch of the Presbyterian church known as the "*Secession,*" has penned a treatise on this topic. We will assign him the task of stating and answering the objections to this apostolic institution. The reader will notice that there are many imperfections in his style; despite the influence of Ashdod apparent in his speech, his arguments remain substantial and compelling.

He presents various arguments for the weekly observance of this institution, stating and refuting nine objections to the practice. Here are a few of the most striking: —

## Objection 1

The frequent administration of this ordinance during the apostolic and early ages of Christianity was commendable and necessary because the constant persecutions of that time led them to fear that each Sabbath might be their last. However, we are not in such danger now and therefore do not require such frequent observance of this ordinance.

### Answer

Should we not still live as if every Sabbath could be our last? Do we possess any more assurance of life than they did? Were not many Christians in those times able to live to ripe old ages, just as we do today? Indeed, it is evident, from the best historians, that the church faced general persecution only about one-third of the time when weekly communion was practiced. But even if they had been persistently exposed to the most brutal persecution, the objection becomes even more ludicrous. Just because they risked their lives to attend this ordinance weekly, does that mean that now, when God presents us with better opportunities to do so, we should forgo it? Does God demand his people to perform the greatest work when he provides the least opportunity? Or does he ask for less work when he grants the greatest opportunities? What kind of master would God be in such a case? In addition, do not people need this ordinance to guard against the world's temptations as much as its threats? — "Let us flip this objection around and see if it holds more weight. The primitive Christians participated in the Lord's supper weekly because their souls were in greater danger from the allurements and temptations of the world, which are often more detrimental to spiritual well-being than its frowns. They had greater opportunities for doing so during times of peace and freedom; yet this frequent practice is not deemed necessary now, as we, being under the world's challenges, are in less peril concerning our spiritual matters; especially since we cannot partake of it without risking our lives, since God has explicitly stated that he prefers mercy over sacrifice."

## Objection 2

The eras of the early church and the Reformation were marked by significant spiritual vitality and abundant divine influences bestowed upon the souls of believers; whereas now it is entirely different. Therefore, although frequent administration was appropriate then, in our weakened, decayed state, it is unnecessary.

### Answer

Should we not visit the wells of salvation often simply because we can draw only a little water each time? Should we not strive to fill our pitchers at the fountain of living waters because they are small? Isn’t this ordinance a remedy for the languishing, a source of strength for the weak, and a revival for the dying believer? How reasonable it is then to argue that languishing, weak, sick, and dying believers shouldn't have it frequently administered, simply because they are not in perfect health?" — "Wouldn't the objection read better if we flipped it? The early Christians had this ordinance frequently administered to them because, being weary and frail, weak and sickly, and only receiving scant communications of divine influence at a time, it was necessary for them to have frequent sustenance: whereas we now, being strong and lively Christians, receiving large supplies of grace sufficient to sustain us for many days, have no need for such frequent attendance to this ordinance, which is especially meant for the strengthening of weak, sickly believers.

## Objection 3

If the Lord's supper were frequently administered, it would become less solemn and, in time, quite contemptible, just as we see with baptism due to the frequency of that ordinance's administration.

### Answer

Is the means by which we maintain the solemnity of the Lord's supper God's design or not? If it is, where in His Word does it warrant this? I have already disproved this from Scripture. Since it is merely a human invention, what basis is there to believe it will genuinely uphold the credit and solemnity of the ordinance? Did not the Papists of the past also try to maintain and enhance its solemnity by reducing the frequency of its administration? Did they not deny the cup to the people, which Calvin claimed was the natural outcome of their practice? Did they not attach the administration of this ordinance to those occasions which superstition had elevated, such as Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas? Did they not bind a multitude of ceremonies to it? Did they not assert that it was a real sacrifice, and that the elements were transformed through consecration into the actual body and blood of Christ? And did all of this contribute to the proper respect for this ordinance? On the contrary, did it not undermine it? While the doctrine of transubstantiation instilled a certain reverence for it, was this reverence divine? Or was it not more akin to devil worship, adoring the elements? Now, how can we be certain that our infrequent administration of this ordinance will more effectively uphold its solemnity? Isn't it peculiar that we derive so much encouragement from the practices of the Apostles, the early Christians, and all the reformed churches, to desecrate this solemn ordinance; while the most ignorant and immoral Papists offer the original example for the practice that would uphold its honor? How odd would it be that, in order to sustain the integrity of God's ordinance, we must forsake the paths of the flock and tread the routes laid down by the most ignorant and wicked antichristians? "Moreover, if our infrequent administration of this ordinance makes it solemn, wouldn't it become even more so if administered only once every seven, ten, twenty, thirty, sixty, or a hundred years?" — "Have we not found that those who pray once a month or hear a sermon once a year have their minds more deeply impressed with solemn thoughts about God than those who pray seven times a day and hear a hundred sermons throughout the year?

> Let's flip this objection and see how it sounds. All human efforts to make God's ordinances more solemn reflect poorly on His wisdom and have always led to contempt for the ordinances. The infrequent administration of the supper is a human invention, first conceived by the worst Papists, and as such it brings disdain onto this ordinance, as is sadly illustrated in the practices of those who voluntarily partake infrequently.

The way the weekly observance of the supper was discontinued, Mr. Brown offers the following observation: —

> "The means by which the infrequent administration of this ordinance appears to have been introduced into the church seem unwarranted by the God of truth. The causes of its introduction seem to have stemmed from pride, superstition, greed, and carnal indifference. The Eastern hermits, withdrawing from society, lived in deserts and mountains, and being far removed from places of administration, seldom attended. This, while genuinely the result of their laziness and distance, they pretended arose from their reverence for this most solemn ordinance. Imitating this imagined holiness, which stemmed from neglecting God's ordinance, many Eastern Christians ceased to participate except on occasions deemed solemn by superstition, such as Pasch; and they were content to merely observe on other occasions. Due to this practice, we find the great and eloquent Chrysostom, time and again, harshly criticizing them for their contempt of God and Christ and labeling their practice a most wicked custom."

An objection not directly stated by Mr. Brown, which I have frequently heard, stems from the phrase, "*as often as you do this,* do it in remembrance of me." From this language, it is argued that we are not bound by any law regarding how often we should partake; hence we cannot be condemned for partial or complete neglect: for 'where there is no law, there is no transgression.' The term 'as *often*' is not meant to approve of frequency but to specify the manner. 'Always do it in remembrance of me.' The context in which these words are used is concerned with the manner or intention of the observance, not with how often it might or might not be celebrated; it is a violation of all rules of interpretation to derive a different matter from them that was not present to the Apostle's mind. Furthermore, if the phrase 'as oft' leaves the decision up to any group regarding how often they celebrate, then they are blameless if they never, or only once in their lives, proclaim the Savior's death. This interpretation suggests an observance that lacks reason, law, precedent, and consequently obligation.

Following Mr. Brown, we will present a few excerpts from **William King**, Archbishop of Dublin. The editors of the *Christian Examiner* featured a valuable extract from Mr. King in their May 7 issue of the first volume, from which I quote the following, pp. 163, 165, 166, 167: —

> "The following comments on this institution of our Savior are taken from a '*Discourse concerning the Inventions of Men in the Worship of God,*' by William King of Ireland. He was born at Antrim in 1650; educated at Trinity College, Dublin; and held successively the offices of Dean of St. Patrick's, Bishop of Derry, and Archbishop of Dublin. He passed away in 1729. His approach in this discourse is to examine and contrast the worship of God as taught in the Scriptures with the practices of various religious sects of the time: —

> 'Christ's positive command to do this in remembrance of him, etc., obliges us to do it at certain times and in specific places. There is no better way to determine when we are required to do this than to observe when God, in His goodness, provides us the opportunity; for either we are then obliged to do it, or we may choose whether to do so at all; since there exists no better measure for frequency than the opportunity provided by God. The same rule applies to other general positive commands, such as those that require us to be charitable; we can be sure this applies to this ordinance as well. Therefore, whoever disregards or neglects any opportunity for receiving what God offers sins just as much as he who, enabled by God to act charitably and presented with a fitting opportunity, fails to assist others or closes off his compassion, regarding whom the Scriptures assure us that the love of God does not reside within him. The argument is even stronger against those who neglect this holy ordinance; for how can it be thought that a person genuinely loves his Savior or understands his sufferings if he refuses or neglects to remember the greatest of all blessings in such an easy fashion, when commanded to do so by his Redeemer and invited by God's own provided opportunity? 

> It is clear that, if it is not our own fault, we could have an opportunity every Lord's Day when we gather together; thus any church that lays aside this command is at fault in its order and worship, which do not necessitate or provide for this practice. Christ's command seems to lead us directly to it: for 'Do this in remembrance of me,' implies that Christ was to leave them, that they were to gather together after his departure, and that he required them to remember him at their meetings while he was away. The very purpose of our public gatherings on the Lord's Day, not on the Jewish Sabbath, is to remember and keep in our minds what Christ did and suffered for us until his return; and we must do this, not in ways our own inventions suggest, but through the means prescribed by Christ Himself, which is by celebrating this holy ordinance.

> Therefore, it seems likely that from the very establishment of this ordinance, our Savior intended it to be a part of God's service in all solemn assemblies of Christians, just as the Passover was in the gatherings of the Jews. To know how often Christ requires us to celebrate this feast, we only need to inquire how often Christ requires us to meet together; that is, at least every Lord's Day.'"

Next, we will hear from an American Rabbi of great renown, **Dr. John Mason**, of New York. The passages I quote are found in a note attached to page 188 of the New York edition of Fuller's Strictures on Sandemanianism.

> "Mr. Fuller does not deny that the Lord's Supper was observed by the first Christians every Lord's Day (nor will this be denied by any person who has honestly examined the subject), but he seems to think that Acts 20:7 does not provide evidence for this; others, renowned for their piety and depth of study, have considered this passage as conclusive proof of the weekly observance of the Lord's Supper. Dr. Scott, in his valuable Commentary, comments on this passage, '*Breaking of bread,* or commemorating the death of Christ in the Eucharist, was a primary reason for their gathering; this ordinance seems to have been *constantly administered every Lord's Day,* and probably no professed Christians absented themselves from it after being admitted into the church, unless they were under some censure or faced some genuine hindrance.'

> "Dr. Mason, from this city, in his Letters on Frequent Communion, speaks even more decisively on this subject. 'It is well known that during the first three centuries of the Christian era, communions were held with a frequency we no longer see among us. It is also well known that the original frequency of communions declined as carnality and corruption took root. Furthermore, it is equally evident that this practice has been encouraged as a serious duty by the most virtuous individuals and the best churches in the best of times.'

> "Weekly communion did not cease with the Apostles and their contemporaries. There is a multitude of witnesses who can attest that it was preserved by succeeding Christians with great care and reverence for over two centuries. It is unnecessary to overload these pages with quotations. The fact is indisputable.

> "Communion every Lord's Day was universal and was upheld in the Greek church until the seventh century; and those who neglected *three weeks* in a row were excommunicated.

> "In this way, the spirit of ancient piety cherished the memory of the Savior's love. There was no need for reproof, remonstrance, or entreaty. No trivial excuses for neglect were ever made by a Christian; for *such* neglect had not yet tarnished the Christian's reputation. He carried sufficient incentives within himself to willingly obey the commandments of his Lord. It was his choice, his comfort, his joy. These were days of life and glory; but soon days of dishonor and death would follow; and among the most ominous signs of their approach was the waning of frequent communion. For as the vitality of faith reveals itself in a desire to consistently magnify the Lord Jesus, so the decay of it is first indicated by the encroachments of indifference. It was in the *fourth* century that the church began to clearly forsake her first love.

> "The excellent Calvin laments that during this time, believers, believing they had fulfilled their duty by partaking of communion just once, surrendered themselves for the rest of the year to complacency and laziness. 'It ought to have been,' he said, 'entirely different. *Every week,* at minimum, the table of the Lord should have been prepared for Christian gatherings, and the promises declared through which we might be spiritually nourished in our partaking.'"

Now we will hear from the renowned **John Wesley**. After fifty-five years of reflection on the subject, he concludes that Christians should commemorate the Lord's death every Lord's Day. He introduces his 106th sermon, based on Luke 22:19, with this remark: —

> "This discourse was written over fifty-five years ago for my students at Oxford. I have added very little but have cut much; for I previously used too many words. But I thank God, I have not yet seen cause to alter my views on anything contained in it."

The sermon is titled "The Duty of Constant Communion," addressing which the Reformer states —

> "It is no surprise that those without a fear of God think little of this. But it is bewildering that this should be ignored by anyone who fears God and desires to save their soul; yet nothing is more common. One reason many neglect it is that they are so afraid of *eating and drinking unworthily* that they never consider how much greater the danger is in not eating or drinking at all."

When discussing *constant* reception of the supper, Mr. Wesley asserts —

> "I emphasize *constant* receiving. As for the term *frequent* communion, it is utterly absurd. If it means anything other than constant, it suggests more than can be demonstrated as necessary for any man. For if we are not required to partake *constantly,* what argument can prove that we must partake *frequently?* Should we be content with participating once a year? Or once in seven years? Or just once before we die? Every argument put forth for this either proves that we ought to partake *constantly,* or it proves nothing at all. Hence, that vague, indeterminate expression should be discarded by all sensible individuals. Our capability is the only standard for our duty. Whatever we can do, we ought to do. Regarding this or any other command, he who, when he may obey if he chooses not to, will find no place in the kingdom of heaven."

While we may have some objections to the manner in which John Wesley articulates the meaning of this institution — just as we do with all the others from whom we have quoted — we would encourage the entire Methodist community to thoroughly review the above sermon. It can be found in volume 3, pp. 171-179.

The elders among the Methodists, with whom John Wesley is a respected authority, should remember his *advice* found in his Letters to America, 1784, recently quoted in the Gospel Herald, Lexington, Kentucky.

> "**I also advise the elders to administer the Lord's supper on every Lord's Day.**"

This summarizes the views of John Brown, John Mason, and John Wesley, as well as the sources they referenced. While quoting the thoughts of the Johns, I am reminded of something said by the great **John Milton**, the "immortal bard" of England. In his posthumous works, he states: "The Lord's supper (which the doctrine of transubstantiation, or rather anthropophagy, has nearly transformed into a banquet of cannibals) must be observed and may be administered appropriately by anyone, not just an appointed minister. There is no group of people that can claim the exclusive right to either distribute or withhold the sacred elements, as we are all priests in the church." "The head of a household, or anyone appointed by him, is free to celebrate the Lord's supper from house to house, just as was done during the Passover" — "all Christians are a royal priesthood; therefore any believer is qualified to act as an ordinary minister, as convenience requires, provided they are endowed with the necessary gifts, which constitute their commission." Thus, the famous John Milton paved the way for the weekly observance of the supper, removing it from the priestly rituals and penances of the dark ages.

A multitude of witnesses to the clarity and certainty of the New Testament regarding the weekly celebration of the Lord's Supper can be presented. However, we believe this is unnecessary; and in an effort to avoid excessive length, we will simply add a few excerpts from the third volume of the *Christian Baptist*, 2nd edition, p. 254, to support the assertion that *all antiquity stands by the disciples meeting every first day to break bread.* —

> All antiquity agrees that for the *first three centuries,* all churches broke bread weekly. Pliny, in his Epistles, Book 10; Justin Martyr, in his Second Apology for the Christians; and Tertullian, De Ora, page 135, affirm that it was the universal practice in all weekly assemblies of brethren, after they had prayed and sung praises—

> 'Then bread and wine being brought to the *chief brother,* he takes it and offers praise and thanksgiving to the Father, in the name of the Son and Holy Spirit. After the prayers and thanksgiving, the entire assembly says, *Amen!* When the thanksgiving concludes by the *chief guide,* with the consent of the whole congregation, the *deacons* (as we call them) distribute portions of the bread and wine to everyone present, over which thanks have been offered.'

> "The weekly communion was maintained in the Greek church until the *seventh century;* and by one of their canons, 'those who neglected *three weeks* in succession were excommunicated.'

> "By the *fourth century,* when all began to change due to the influx of baptized Pagans, this practice began its decline. Some councils in the western part of the Roman Empire endeavored to uphold it through their canons. The council held in Illiberis in Spain, A.D. 324, decreed that 'no offerings should be accepted from those who did not receive the Lord's Supper.'

> "The council at Antioch, A.D. 341, dictated that 'all who came to church, heard the Scriptures read, but did not engage in prayer nor partake in the sacrament, should be expelled from the church until they publicly demonstrate their repentance.'

> "Despite all these canons, they could not compel the carnal crowd of professing Christians to partake in a practice that held no spiritual appeal for them; and, in reality, it was likely to disappear altogether. To prevent this, the Council of Agatha in Languedoc, A.D. 506, ruled that 'none should be considered good Christians who did not *communicate* at least *three times* a year—at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsunday.' This soon became regarded as the standard for a good Christian, and it was deemed presumptuous to commune more often.

> "This continued for over six centuries until even *three* communions a year became tiresome; and then the infamous Council of Lateran, which mandated auricular confession and transubstantiation, declared that 'an annual communion at Easter sufficed.' This association of the 'sacrament' with Easter, along with the mechanical devotion of the uninformed at this time, greatly contributed to the worship of the Host. Thus the weekly breaking of bread in simplicity and godly sincerity devolved into a grand sacrament only once a year during Easter.

> "During the Reformation, this subject was given only minimal attention by the reformers. Some, however, paid heed to it. Even Calvin, in his Institutes, lib. 4. chap. 17: sect. 46, states, 'And indeed this custom, which requires communicating once a year, *is a most evident contrivance of the Devil,* regardless of who enforced it.'

> "And again (Inst. lib. 6, chap. 18: sect. 56), he remarks, 'It should have been quite different. *Every week,* at minimum, the Lord's table should be prepared for Christian gatherings, and the promises declared through which we might be spiritually nourished.'

> "Martin Chemnitz, Witsius, Calderwood, and other reformers and theologians agree with Calvin; and nearly every commentator on the New Testament concurs with the Presbyterian Henry in his remarks on Acts 20:7, stating that in primitive times it was customary for many churches to celebrate the Lord's Supper every Lord's Day.

> "The Belgic Reformed Church, in 1851, arranged for the supper to be received every other month. The Reformed Churches of France, after admitting that they had been too neglectful, observing the supper only four times a year, advocated for *increased frequency.* The Church of Scotland initially allowed for *four* sacramental celebrations each year; but some of its ministers advocated for up to *twelve* times. This situation persisted until the conclusion of the last century.

> "Since the start of the current century, numerous congregations in England, Scotland, Ireland, and some in the United States and Canada, both Independents and Baptists, have been partaking of the supper every Lord's Day, and this practice is increasingly gaining traction.

> "These historical notes may be useful for those who constantly cry out against *Innovation! Innovation!* But we advocate both the principle and the practice based purely on apostolic grounds. Blessed is the servant who, knowing his Master's will, acts quickly and with joy!

> "Those wishing to see a strong refutation of the Presbyterian method of observing the sacrament, as well as a defense of weekly communion, would benefit from reading Dr. John Mason's Letters on Frequent Communion; he is a high-toned Presbyterian, and as such, his comments will be taken more seriously by his peers than mine."

Thus, our seventh proposition is supported by the explicit statements of the New Testament, the rationality of the concept as suggested by the Apostles, by analogy, by the conclusions of the most renowned reformers, and by the collective consensus of all Christian antiquity. Yet, for authority and instruction regarding *this* and *every other* Christian institution, we rely on the plain words of the Lord and His Apostles.

It does, indeed, appear somewhat incongruous that arguments must be presented to persuade Christians to gather weekly around the Lord's table. It would align more with the spirit of our faith to observe them anxiously seeking the honor of a seat at the King's table, expressing fervent interest in being allowed to partake in His presence and in honor of His love. It would be far more reasonable to resist their daily requests for this purpose than to have to reason with them to encourage their assembly for weekly communion.

But just as a lack of appetite for physical sustenance indicates poor health or impending disease, a disinterest in spiritual nourishment points to a lack of spiritual vitality or the presence of moral corruption that, if left untreated, will lead to a departure from the Living Head. Thus, among the most obvious signs of spiritual decline, the most telling is a lack of desire for the spiritual nourishment that the Good Physician has prepared for His family. A healthy and robust Christian can scarcely be found, absent from the ample provisions of the Lord's house.

However, much depends on the *manner* in which the supper is celebrated, as well as the *frequency.* The simplicity of the Christian institution permeates every aspect of it. While there is a form for doing everything, the utmost attention is given to the thing signified. Yet, there is both form and substance; everything done must occur in some manner. A well-mannered Christian is like a well-mannered gentleman — his conduct is graceful, relaxed, genuine, and straightforward. All rigidity and forced formality are as unbecoming in a Christian as they are in a gentleman. A courteous and polite gathering differs immensely from a soldier’s mess or a ship’s crew in all table-related ceremonies. There exists a Christian decorum and order, similarly distinct from political courtesy and social nicety.

Nothing is more off-putting than pretense. It is a type of hypocrisy in conduct, which, like hypocrisy in faith, is more odious than indifference or coarseness. There's an artificial sanctity in demeanor and appearance that contrasts starkly with true holiness, just as foppery does with genuine politeness. The facade of sanctimoniousness should be avoided just as vigorously as actual immoral looseness. A stern and rigid pharisaism sits as awkwardly on a Christian as a mourning outfit on a bride. Cheerfulness is not the same as frivolity — solemnity does not equate to pharisaism — joy is not equal to noise — nor is eating merely about festivity.

However, one must feel right in order to act right in any situation. If we wish to show love, we must first possess it. If a person desires to walk humbly, they must be humble; and if one wishes to exemplify Christianity on any occasion, they must genuinely live as a Christian. Individuals who engage daily with God and constantly reflect on His salvation will instinctively know how to conduct themselves at the Lord's table.

The following excerpt from my Memorandum Book presents the closest approximation to the ideal model of good order and Christian decorum in observing this institution. Indeed, the entire order of that congregation was commendable: —

> "The church in — — — — comprised about fifty members. Lacking an individual they regarded as fitting the biblical description of a Bishop, they appointed two senior members, with serious demeanor, to lead their meetings. These individuals might not have been capable of laboring in the word and teaching, but they were qualified to govern effectively and preside with Christian dignity. One of them led each meeting. Once the assembly gathered in the morning at eleven o'clock (as they had agreed to meet at that time and adjourn at two o'clock during winter), they greeted one another with a warm and friendly manner familiar to brothers meeting for social purposes; the day’s president then stood and said: 'Brethren, meeting in the name and by the authority of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ on this day of His resurrection, let us unite in celebrating His praise.' He recited the following stanza: —

> - Christ the Lord is risen today!
>
>   Sons of men and angels say;
>
>   Raise your joys and triumphs high,
>   Sing, O heavens! and earth, reply!"

> "The congregation arose and sang this hymn with enthusiastic voices. The president then invited a brother, a distinctly articulate reader, to read a passage from the Gospel. The brother stood and read aloud the account of the crucifixion of the Messiah. After a brief moment of silence, the president called upon a brother to pray in the name of the congregation. His prayer was filled with gratitude to the Father of Mercies and requests for blessings for themselves and all people as promised to those who ask or for which men are commanded to pray. The language was highly appropriate; there were no meaningless repetitions, no strained effort to express everything that passed through his mind, but rather a slow, clear, and emphatic articulation of heartfelt desires. The prayer was relatively short, and the entire congregation—brothers and sisters—said a resounding final *Amen.*

> "After the prayer, a passage from one of the Epistles was read by the president himself, followed by a song request from the congregation. A brother stood up, announced the page, and recited—

> "'Twas on that night when doom'd to know
>   That eager rage of every foe;
>
>   That night in which he was betray'd
>   The Savior of the world took bread.'

> "He then sat down, and the congregation sang with great emotion.

> I observed that the table had been prepared before the disciples arrived in the morning, with the disciples seated on benches on each side, while guests sat further away. The president stood and stated that our Lord had a table for His friends, inviting His disciples to dine with Him. 'In memory of His death, this monumental table,' he said, 'was instituted; and just as the Lord lives eternally in heaven, so He lives in the hearts of His people. As the first disciples, taught directly by the Apostles, came together in one place to partake of the Lord's Supper, and as they chose the first day of the week to honor His resurrection for this purpose, so we, sharing the same Lord, faith, and hope, have vowed to emulate their practice. We owe as much to the Lord as they did and should love, honor, and obey Him just as they did.' Having spoken, he took a small loaf from the table, and after thanking God for it in one or two phrases, he broke it and handed it to the disciples beside him, who passed the broken loaf until all had partaken. There was no rigidity, no formality, no ostentation; everything was smooth, familiar, solemn, and joyful. He then took the cup in a similar way, offered thanks for it, and passed it to the disciples next to him, who in turn served each other until everyone was attended to. The thanksgiving before breaking the loaf and before sharing the cup was as succinct and relevant to the occasion as the thanks typically offered at a regular table for God’s everyday bounty. They then rose and united in a final hymn —

> - To Him that lov'd the sons of men,
>   And washed us in His blood;
>
>   To royal honors raised our heads,
>   And made us priests to God!"

> "The meeting's president called upon a brother to remember the poor and those ignorant of the path to life before the Lord. He knelt, and the brethren prayed together with him, beseeching the Father of Mercies for all the afflicted sons and daughters of hardship, the destitute, and for the world’s conversion. Following this prayer, the sharing, or offering, took place, and the entire church demonstrated sincerity in their desires through cheerful and generous contributions into the treasury as the Lord had prospered them.

> "A general invitation was issued to all members of the brotherhood to propose any thoughts or inquiries contributing to the edification of the congregation. Several members rose successively, reading passages from both the Old and New Testaments about some previously discussed matters. Various remarks were made, and after singing several spiritual hymns chosen by the members, when a brother signaled that it was time to conclude, the day’s president ended the meeting with the apostolic blessing.

> "I gathered that all these activities were consistently included in their gatherings; however, the sequence of events varied. On each occasion when I was present, no one spoke without invitation or without first requesting permission from the president, and no one left the meeting before the designated time unless given special permission. Nothing seemed overly formal or ceremonious. Everything showcased both the power and form of godliness, and no attendee could leave without feeling edified and convinced that the Spirit of God was present. The joy, affection, and reverence displayed in this small assembly strongly advocated for their order and served as the best comment on the excellence of the Christian institution."

# Proposition 6

***The breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup are a remembrance of the Lord's death.***

On the bread and the cup of the Lord, in words that speak not to the eye, but to the heart of every disciple, is inscribed, "*When you see this, remember me.*" Indeed, the Lord says to each disciple, as he receives the symbols into his hand, 'This is my body broken for *you*. This is my blood shed for *you*. The bread is thus established as a representation of his body — first whole, then wounded for our sins. The cup is thus instituted as a representation of his blood — once his life, but now poured out to cleanse us from our sins. To every disciple he says, For *you* my body was wounded; for *you* my life was taken. In receiving it, the disciple says, "Lord, I believe it. My life came from your suffering; my joy from your sorrows; and my hope of everlasting glory from your humiliation and abasement even to death." Each disciple, in handing the symbols to his fellow-disciple, says, in effect, "You, my brother, once an outsider, are now a citizen of heaven; once a stranger, you are now brought into the family of God. You have acknowledged my Lord as your Lord, my people as your people. Under Jesus the Messiah, we are one. Embraced in the everlasting arms, I embrace you in mine: your sorrows shall be my sorrows, and your joys my joys. Joint recipients of God’s favor and the love of Jesus, we shall jointly suffer with him, so that we may jointly reign with him. Let us, then, renew our strength, remember our King, and hold firmly to our cherished hope unwavering to the end."

- Blessed be the tie that binds

  Our hearts in Christian love;

  The fellowship of kindred minds
  Is like that above.


Here he knows no one after the flesh. Ties that arise from eternal love, revealed in blood, and addressed to his senses, evoke all that is within him of affectionate feelings and emotions, towards those joint heirs with him of the grace of eternal life. While it represents to him '*the bread of life*' — the entirety of the Lord's salvation — it is the strength of his faith, the joy of his hope, and the life of his love.

This institution commemorates the love that reconciled us to God, and continually provides us with a new reason to live for him who died for us. For anyone who does not feel the eloquence and power of this argument, all other arguments are in vain. God’s goodness, evident in creation and in his providence, is well designed to lead people to reform. But the heart that is indifferent to these appeals and to which Calvary speaks in vain is beyond feeling, hardened, and unreclaimable, beyond the reach of any moral power known to humankind.

Every time the disciples gather around the Lord's table, they are given a new argument against sin, as well as a new proof of the love of God. It aims both to crucify the world in our hearts and to draw us closer to God, spreading his love within us. Therefore, it must reasonably be a regular part of Christian worship in all Christian gatherings; which leads us to state, illustrate, and support the following main proposition, to which the preceding six are all preliminary.

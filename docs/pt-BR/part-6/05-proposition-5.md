# Proposition 5

***The one loaf must be broken before the saints partake of it, which has brought this institution the name of "breaking the loaf."***

But some, undoubtedly, will ask, 'Is it not called *the Lord's Supper*?' Some have believed, including Dr. Bell, that 1 Cor. 11:20 applies to love feasts or charity gatherings, rather than to the remembrance of the Lord's death. They might interpret the passage as follows: — 'But your coming together in one place is not for eating a Lord's Supper; for in eating it, each one takes his own supper first,' alluding, as they think, to a love feast eaten before *the breaking of the loaf.* But this Lord's Supper is distinctly separate from their *own* supper. And could it not be said with equal reason that you cannot call *your* remembrance of the Lord's death a Lord's Supper; for before eating it, you have eaten your own supper, which prevents you from making it a *supper*? You do not make it a Lord's Supper if you first eat your supper. Nor, indeed, could the Corinthians call any meal a "Lord's Supper" if it was conducted as their own suppers were; for some ate and drank to excess while others who were poor, or had no supper to bring, were hungry and put to shame. Could this be called a supper in honor of the Lord?

However, since the Lord had eaten a religious supper, having partaken of the Passover lamb with his disciples, before he instituted the breaking of the loaf and drinking of the cup as a memorial of his death, it seems inappropriate to call it a supper; for it was established and eaten *after* a supper. Not in the sense of being one of the meals of the day can it be considered either dinner or supper; for it does not replace any meal. *Deipnos,* rendered *supper* here, in the days of Homer, signified breakfast. It also referred to food in general or a feast.

In the times of Demosthenes, it denoted a feast or an evening meal. But it is even more important to observe that it is used figuratively in the New Testament as well as literally. Hence, we have the gospel blessings compared to a supper. We read of the 'marriage supper of the Lamb' and 'the supper of the Great God.' Jesus says, 'If any man opens to me, I will (*deipneso*) eat supper with him, and he with me.' When thus used, it neither concerns the time of day nor the quantity eaten. If applied, then, to this institution, it is figuratively, as it is elsewhere referred to as "*the feast.*" For not only did the Lord institute it, but in partaking of it, we have communion with the Lord. The same idiom with the addition of the article appears in Rev. 1:10. '*he kuriake hemera,*' the Lord's day. Overall, it seems more probable that the Apostle uses the words *kuriakos deipnos,* or Lord's Supper, in reference to the breaking of the loaf for which they gave thanks in honor of the Lord, rather than to their own supper or the love feasts customary among the brethren. If we say in accordance with the Apostle's style, the Lord's day, the Lord's table, the Lord's cup, we may also say the Lord's supper. For in the Lord's house, these are all sacred to him.

As the naming of biblical things with biblical names is an important aspect of the current reformation, we may take this opportunity to remark that both "the Sacrament" and "the Eucharist" are of human origin. The former was a name adopted by the Latin church because the observance was thought to represent an oath or vow to the Lord; and, since the term *sacramentum* signified an oath taken by a Roman soldier to be loyal to his general and his country, they presumed to call this institution a sacrament or oath to the Lord. By the Greek church, it is called *the Eucharist,* which means *the giving of thanks,* because thanks were offered for the loaf and the cup before partaking. It is also referred to as communion, or "*the communion of the saints;*" but this might suggest that it is exclusively *the* communion of saints; thus, it is more consistent to call it literally 'the breaking of the loaf.' But this is only a preliminary to illustrating and proving our fifth proposition.

We have said that the loaf must be broken before the saints partake of it. Jesus took a loaf from the Passover table and broke it before giving it to his disciples. They received a broken loaf, symbolizing his body once whole, but by his own choice broken for his disciples. In eating it, we remember that the Lord's body was broken or wounded for us by his own consent. Therefore, he who gives thanks for the loaf should break it, not as the representative of the Lord, but in imitation of his example; and after the disciples have partaken of this loaf, handing it to one another, or while they are partaking of it, the disciple who breaks it shares with them in the broken loaf — thus they all have communion with the Lord and with one another in eating the broken loaf. And in this way, they, as priests, feast upon his sacrifice. For the priests ate of the sacrifices and were thus partakers of the altar. Proof of all this can be found in the institution given in Matt. 26:1-75; Mark 14:1-72; Luke 22:1-71; and 1 Cor. 11:1-34. In each passage, his breaking of the loaf, *after* giving thanks and *before* his disciples partook of it, is clearly stated.

It is, therefore, not surprising that the literal designation of this institution should be what Luke has given it in his Acts of the Apostles, thirty years after its institution. The first time he mentions it is in Acts 2:42, when he emphatically refers to it as *te klasei tou artou,* the breaking of the loaf, a name that at the time of his writing, A.D. 64, was universally understood. For, as he notes while recording the piety and devotion of the first converts, 'they continued steadfast in the teaching of the Apostles, in the fellowship, in *the breaking of the loaf,* and in the prayers — praising God.' It is true that there is more than just breaking a loaf in this institution. However, in keeping with general, if not universal usage, the first or most prominent aspect in laws, institutions, and practices typically gives it a name. Thus, we have our *Habeas Corpus,* our *Fieri Facias,* our *Nisi Prius,* our *Capias,* our *Venditioni Exponas,* names derived from the first words of the law.

But to break a loaf, or *to break bread,* was a common phrase among the Jews to denote ordinary eating for refreshment. For example, Acts 2:46: 'Daily, with one accord, they continued in the temple and in breaking bread from house to house. They ate their *food* with gladness and simplicity of heart.' Also, after Paul had restored Eutychus at Troas, we are informed he broke a loaf and ate. Here it must refer to himself, not only because it is used *indefinitely,* but because the one who eats is the same as the one who breaks a loaf. However, when a recognized usage is mentioned, the article or some specific term clarifies what is being referenced. Thus, in Acts 2:42, it is '*the* breaking of *the* loaf.' And in Acts 20:7, it is 'They assembled for *the* breaking of the loaf.' This loaf is explained by Paul in 1 Cor. 10:16: '*The* loaf which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?' This proposition being now, as we believe, sufficiently clear, we shall proceed to present our sixth.

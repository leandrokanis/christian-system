# 26. The Christian Discipline

Members should be publicly received into all societies. They are so in the state. It is a matter of record. When a person is regenerated and desires to be enrolled among the disciples meeting in any one place, if their confession of salvation or immersion has not been publicly known to the brethren, reason suggests that those who are aware of the fact and can attest to their confession should introduce them to the congregation, and they should be welcomed or received as such by the brethren with whom they unite. This is clearly demonstrated by the slightest attention to propriety, reason, and the nature of things. Letters of recommendation were the means used in apostolic times for this formal introduction when a citizen of the kingdom visited any community where they were personally unknown to the brethren.

A person cannot be under the oversight or discipline of a congregation unless they voluntarily associate with the brethren meeting in that place, and unless it is a matter of notoriety or record among the brethren that they are one of them. There can be no formal exclusion if there is no formal reception. If there is no visible and formal union, there can be no visible and formal separation. In fact, there can be no discipline in any congregation unless it is an organized body; and no body can be organized unless it is known who its members are. On a matter of such plain common sense, we have seldom felt the need to say a word, and would not now have mentioned it at all, had we not found some societies that cannot identify their own members and that even hesitated about the necessity of a formal reception of any person into them, or of having it on record who belonged to them. They demanded a positive commandment or precedent for such a reception. They might as well have demanded a positive commandment for persons to be formally married before they could be recognized as husband and wife, as to seek a positive commandment for one of the most common dictates of reason; indeed, every commandment addressed to Christian congregations concerning relative duties and privileges assumes the principle that those who belong to any society are known to each other; otherwise, they could not even perform simple functions toward one another — they could not know when they were assembled — they could not "wait for one another."

Whether there should be a record in print, in writing, or in the memory of all the congregation is a question that must depend on circumstances. If all the members possess infallible memories, so as never to forget who the members are, when they became such, when anyone was received, when anyone was rejected — I say, if every brother and sister can so well remember these matters that when the discipline of the congregation or any particular question regarding any case of discipline arises, they can recall it all accurately; then, in that case, it is unnecessary to have any record, church book, secretary, or anything written or printed. But if not, there must be a record; because questions involving peace and good order within the society may arise, and have arisen, that require infallible testimony or the most satisfactory evidence on questions of fact; such as, Was A B ever a member of your community? When did they become a member of it? When were they excluded? When were they restored? When did they forsake the assembly of the brethren? Were they a husband at the time of their removal? etc.

Two things are paramount in all cases of discipline brought before the congregation — *the Fact and the Law*. The fact is always to be established by good testimony or by the confession of the transgressor. Once the fact is established, the next question is, *What is the law in this case?* The president of the congregation states the proven fact and lays the law before the brethren. They are to be judges of both the fact and the law, and when both are clearly presented, the question is put. The congregation decides. — This is the oracle of reason — of civil law in all civilized countries; and it is the oracle of the Savior and his Apostles. Private offenses, public offenses, and those that are mixed, are to be decided according to what is written in the Book. This must be known; therefore, after the formation of a congregation, the first lessons to be learned are those concerning the relative duties of the brethren; and discipline among these first lessons stands out prominently. It is too late to learn the law after a case occurs. When there are no cases of discipline in a congregation, then is the time for the brethren to be taught the will of the Lawgiver, that they may be prepared to act with promptness and prudence when required.

"Offenses must come;" and, if possible, they must be healed. To cut off an offender is good; to heal them is better; but to prevent them from falling is best of all. The Christian spirit and system both emphasize vigilance in prevention, quickness in healing offenses, and firmness in removing incorrigible offenders. Its disciplinary code is exceedingly simple, rational, and benevolent. It teaches us to regard all offenses as acts of impiety or acts of immorality; sins against our brethren or sins against God alone; the omission of right or the commission of wrong.

Trespasses against our brethren involve all matters of aggression upon their persons, property, or character. They can be either private or public. We can only offend against a brother's person, property, or character; and we can do this only privately or publicly. Christ's teachings on private or personal offenses, as recorded in the 18th chapter of Matthew, are commendable to both Jews and Gentiles all over the world. They are as clear and excellent as his golden rule of moral feeling.

Without providing any rules to decide who is the aggressor or the aggrieved, allowing either party to view the matter as they please, he instructs anyone who believes themselves to be aggrieved to go to the aggressor and privately tell them their fault. If restitution is made and reconciliation achieved, the matter ends. If not, they should take a second or third person, present the facts of the case, reason, and remonstrate. If this also fails, then they are instructed to inform the church of the matter; and if the aggressor will not hear the church, then they should be treated as a heathen or a publican.

Some, indeed, perceive a difficulty in this case; for after "*tell*" there is no *it* in the original; and they ask, '*What is to be told to the church — the original fault,* or *simply that the aggressor will not make restitution?*' The most natural construction of the sentence favors the simple statement of the fact — that an offense had been committed and restitution refused, without delving into the details of the trespass. However, a second difficulty has been suggested regarding how the congregation is to be informed. Is it to be presented to the entire community in full assembly? Or to those appointed by the congregation to hear and adjudicate such matters? Certainly, the congregation has ears as well as a tongue, and is not entirely composed of ears or tongues. Every well-organized church has its eldership, who hear all such matters and bring them before the entire assembly only when absolutely necessary, and even then at a convenient time.

The elders hear the matter; and if the case requires a special committee, as Paul calls "secular seats of judgment," (1 Cor. 6:4) they appoint it; and only after their decision is refused do they bring it before the whole congregation, where the person is excluded from among them, treated as a heathen or a publican — one entitled only to civil, and not to Christian, respect — one whose company is to be avoided rather than sought.

The entire community can act, and ought to act, in receiving and excluding persons; but as a whole, it can never become judges of offenses and a tribunal for trial. Such an institution was never set up by divine authority. No community is composed solely of wise and discreet adults. The Christian church encompasses old men, young men, and infants in Christ. Shall the voice of a child be heard or counted as a vote in a case of discipline? What is the use of bishops in a church if everyone is to rule — of judges, if all are judges of fact and law? No wonder that conflicts, heartaches, and scandals of all sorts disturb these communities ruled by a democracy of the whole — where everything is judged in public and full assembly. Such is not the Christian system. It ordains that certain individuals shall judge and rule, and that all things shall "be done decently and in order."

In addition to matters of private trespass between brethren, there are matters of public wrongdoing, or acts of injustice toward the entire Christian community, and also toward those outside. Drunkenness by a church member, for instance, is a sin against God and against all the Christian brotherhood. It is also a public nuisance to all individuals, to the extent that it is witnessed or known. The transgressor in such a case, if unrepentant and unreformed, must be confronted with the offense. An attempt to convict them of the offense is not to be made until they fail to acknowledge it. A failure to acknowledge, or an attempt to deny, calls for conviction and precludes the idea of repentance.

In all cases of conviction, the church is to be addressed through its leaders. No private individual has the right to accuse anyone before the entire community. The charge, in no case, should be brought before the whole congregation. Such a process has no precedent in the Law or in the Gospel — in any well-regulated society, church, or state. If any brother falls into a public offense, those aware of it should notify the elders of the church, or those presiding over it at the time, of the fact and the evidence upon which they rely. The matter is then in the hands of the appropriate persons. They investigate it; and upon the accused's denial, seek to convict them of the allegation.

When a person is convicted of any offense, they are unworthy of the confidence of the brethren; for conviction implies concealment and denial, which are, of course, evidence of impenitence. We do not say that such a person is never again to be worthy of such confidence; but until they provide satisfactory proof of genuine repentance, they are to be treated as one not part of the body of Christ.

In all cases of hopeful repentance, the transgressor is to be restored with admonition. The acknowledgment of an offense, and of repentance for it, should in all cases be as public as the sin itself. Peter's sin and repentance are as public as his name. So were David's. So should be those of all transgressors. Those who have caused the Savior and his faithful followers to blush ought to be made to blush before the world; and if their sorrow and amendment are genuine, they will do it cheerfully and fully. "Rebuke those who sin before all, so that others may also fear." (1 Tim. 5:20). 

On the subject of *exclusion*, or what is commonly called *excommunication*, which places the subject in the position of a pagan or publican to the entire Christian community, all Protestant sects seem to agree. The Baptist Discipline, appended to the Confession of Faith taken from the works of Dr. John Owen, Dr. Goodwin, and other Congregationalists and Independents, speaks in full harmony with our views — 9th edition, 1798, p. 20. — "The manner of proceeding in this great and serious instituted ordinance is, the church being gathered together, the offender also having been notified to come and make their answer and defense (if they do not come, they aggravate their offense by despising the authority of Christ in his church); the body of the church must be fully informed of the offender's crime and the full proof thereof as a plain matter of fact; and after careful consideration and consulting the rules of direction given in the word of God, whether the offender is present or absent, the minister or elder puts the question to the whole church, whether they judge the person guilty of the crime now proven against them, and whether they are worthy of the church's censure for the same? To which the members in general give their judgment; which, if in the affirmative, then the judgment of the members in general or the majority of them is taken, and the pastor, minister, or elder sums up the sentence of the church, explains the nature of the crime, and indicates the appropriateness of the censure according to gospel rule; and having done this, a proper time is fixed to carry out the sentence; at which time the pastor, minister, or elder of the church, as their place and duty require, lays out the serious nature of such a sin, with all the aggravating circumstances, and emphasizes what an abominable scandal such an offender has become to religion and what dishonor it brings to God, etc., applying the particular scriptures that are relevant to the case, in order to charge the offense home upon the conscience of the offender, if present, so that others may also fear; also presenting the serious nature of this significant censure, and its main purpose, which is for the salvation and not the destruction of the soul, with much solemnity before the whole society, calling upon God for his gracious presence and blessing upon this sacred ordinance, that its great end may be achieved. Still expressing the deep sense the church has of the fall of this brother, with the great humiliation of the church, and profound sorrow for, and detestation of, the sin committed. The said pastor, minister, or elder, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of the congregation, and with the consent and according to the judicial sentence of the church, cuts off and excludes such an offender by name from the union and communion of the church because of their offenses; so that such a person is not thereafter to be looked upon, deemed, or considered a brother or member of such a church, until God shall restore them again through repentance."

Whether it is always prudent in the early stages of every case of discipline to have open doors, or whether some cases may require closed doors, are questions subject to human discretion; but in the case of the ultimate decision by the congregation, and regarding exclusion, there can be only one opinion on the necessity and utility of it being done in the presence of all who may wish to attend.

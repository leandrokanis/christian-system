# 24. The Body of Christ

That institution which is separate from the world and brings together the people of God into a unique community—having its own laws, ordinances, practices, and customs, directly derived from the Savior of the world—is called the *congregation* or *church* of the Lord. This is sometimes technically referred to as the *mystical* body of Christ, distinguished from his literal and natural body. Over this spiritual body, he is the Head, the King, Lord, and Lawgiver, and they are individually members of his body, under his direction and governance.

The *true* Christian church, or house of God, is composed of all those who, in every place, publicly acknowledge Jesus of Nazareth as the true Messiah and the only Savior of humanity. They build themselves upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, associate under the constitution that he himself has granted and authorized in the New Testament, and walk in his ordinances and commandments—and no others.

This institution, called *the congregation of God,* is a great community of communities—not a community representing communities but a community made up of many individual communities; each is built upon the same foundation, follows the same rules, enjoys the same charter, and is under the jurisdiction of no other community of Christians. It is to all other communities as an individual disciple is to every other individual disciple from a specific community meeting in any given place.

Still, all these individual congregations of the Lord, whether in Rome, Corinth, or Ephesus, while equally independent of one another regarding the management of their own specific affairs, are by virtue of one common Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one common salvation, part of one kingdom or church of God. As such, they are obliged to cooperate with one another in all endeavors that promote the great ends of Christ's death and resurrection.

For this holy communion and cooperation among churches, it is essential that they have an intimate and approving knowledge of one another, which can only be achieved in the form of districts. Thus, the "congregations in Judea" knew each other well and cooperated. Those in Galatia also had mutual knowledge and cooperation. While some churches or members in each district were acquainted with some from another, this allowed the churches of both districts to become acquainted with one another and work together, reaching out to the ends of the earth.

These districts are part of the *circumstances* of Christ's kingdom, as well as the *means* of maintaining correspondence and cooperation among them and the occasions and incidents requiring concerted and joint action. For these, as well as for the circumstances of any particular community, the Apostles offered no specific directions. It was, indeed, impossible for them to do so, as the circumstances of individual communities and the whole church vary across different times and places; no single set of particular, sectional, or intersectional regulations could suit all these unique situations and emergencies. Therefore, these matters are necessarily left to the wisdom and discretion of the entire community, as the particular exigencies and changes in society may require.

However, in granting the communities of believers this necessary liberty to decide what is expedient, orderly, decent, and of public and practical utility in the circumstantial aspects of Christianity, no permission is implied for any interference with a single element of the Christian institution. Hence the necessity of a clear distinction—not between "the essentials and non-essentials," since in Divine Christianity there are no non-essentials—but between the family of God and its circumstances—between the Christian institution and its accidents. It is certain that there is a clear difference between any individual man, family, community, or institution and its circumstances. What could be more evident than the distinction between a person and their clothing, their house, their neighborhood, and their associations and connections?

The Christian institution has its facts, its precepts, its promises, its ordinances, and their meanings or doctrines. These are not matters of policy, arrangement, or expediency, but of divine and immutable ordination and continuance. Thus, the faith, worship, and righteousness, or the doctrine, piety, and morality of the gospel institution, are not legitimate subjects of human legislation, alteration, or arrangement. No individual or community can tamper with these and remain innocent. These rest upon the wisdom and authority of Jehovah; and he who meddles with these presumes to do what even angels dare not. Therefore, whatever is part of the Christian faith or Christian hope—whatever constitutes ordinances or precepts of worship or statutes of moral right and wrong, like the ark of the covenant, should not be touched by uninspired and uncommissioned hands.

However, whether we should register the churches in a given district or the members in a particular church; whether we should meet more than once on the Lord's Day, or at what hour and in what type of building; whether we should commemorate the Lord's death in the morning or afternoon, before dawn or after nightfall; whether we should gather around one table or in our respective seats; whether we should sing from a book or from memory, prose or verse, etc., are matters where our views of expediency, decency, and good order may have free scope. Additionally, whether the churches in a given district should, by letter, messengers, or stated meetings, once or twice a year, or more frequently, communicate with one another; whether they should send one, two, or twenty individuals, or all go to communicate face-to-face, or send a letter; and whether they should annually print, write, or publish their statistics, etc., are merely circumstantial aspects of the Christian institution.

However, cooperation itself is one thing, and the manner of cooperation is another. Cooperation, as much as the intercommunion of Christians, is part of the Christian institution. We must "*strive together* in our prayers" for one another and for the salvation of humanity; and this alone, even if there were no scriptural example or precept on the subject, is sufficient. To pray for one another as individuals or communities implies that we will assist one another in every way for which we pray: otherwise, our prayers and thanksgivings for each other are mere hypocrisy. He who would pray for the advancement of the truth at home and abroad, having it in his power to contribute even a single dollar to that end, but chooses to withhold it, demonstrates how little he values his own prayers and how much he values his money.

From the days of the Apostles until now, cooperative associations of churches have consistently followed the political divisions of the earth. The designations of churches and brethren, such as "in Judea, Galatia, Achaia, Pontus, Cappadocia, Macedonia, Asia, Bithynia," etc., are familiar to all readers of the New Testament. This is a matter of convenience rather than necessity; just as the churches in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, etc., can generally cooperate more conveniently and effectively by states and territories than by any other divisions or precincts. I emphasize that this is a matter of convenience rather than necessity. It is essential that we cooperate, but it's a matter of convenience for the churches in one county, state, or nation to establish regular means for cooperation.

The necessity for cooperation is felt everywhere and in all human associations. It is part of the economy of Heaven. What are mountains but grains of sand? What are oceans but drops of water? And what are the mightiest and most triumphant armies but collections of individual men? The history of the world, both civil and ecclesiastical, illustrates how much more good or harm can be done by cooperation than by individual effort. One hundred well-disciplined churches acting together with Christian zeal, piety, and humanity—frequently meeting in committees of ways and means to build up Zion, to cultivate the enclosed fields, to water the dry and barren spots, to strive together in prayer, in preaching the word, in contributing to the needs of the saints, in enlightening the ignorant, and devising all practicable ways of doing good—would, in a given time, accomplish more than double the same number acting in isolation, without concert, without cooperation, and that united energy, which is always the result of intelligent and heartfelt collaboration.

However, for this to occur, Christians must view the church, or body of Christ, as one community, though made up of many small communities, each of which is an organized member of this greater national organization, which, under Christ as the supreme and sole Head, King, Lord, and Lawgiver, holds the conquest of the whole world in its prayers, aims, plans, and efforts. Therefore, there must be such understanding and agreement among these individual congregations as will suffice to recognize and approve their various actions, so that the members or measures of one community are treated with the respect due to them at home, wherever they may happen to be found. Only on this principle can any number of independent and distinct communities—be they political, commercial, literary, moral, or religious—act in concert with mutual benefit to themselves and with proper regard for the general good.

Anyone who seeks apostolic support for this understanding of cooperation will find ample authority in the Acts and Epistles of the Apostles. Paul addresses "*all the saints* in Rome" in his Epistle to the Romans. Now, in Rome, there were numerous churches, as is evident from chapter 16:5, 10, 11, 14, 15. He addresses all of them as one single community. Again, he represents "all the churches of the Gentiles" as uniting in thanks to Priscilla and Aquila, 16:4. He also represents "the churches of Christ" as sending salutations by him to the Romans, verse 16. In his letters to the Corinthians, he addresses the church of Corinth, "All the saints who are in all Achaia," and "all those in every place who call upon the name of Jesus Christ." 1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 1:1. There he exhorts them to "be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same judgment." 1 Cor. 1:10. "The churches in Asia united in their greetings to the Corinthians," chapter 16:19. He speaks in the second Epistle of all the churches in Achaia as "helping together in prayer for him" and his companions, and of their assistance in his journey in the work of the Lord. In chapter 8, he informs them of the grace of God bestowed on "all the churches in Macedonia," evident through the generosity of their united contributions to the saints. He also speaks of an equality in the mutual contributions of churches in one cooperative effort—and of a brother chosen by various communities to travel with the Apostles, 8:14, 18, 19; and of his accompanying brethren as "messengers of the churches." The entire 9th chapter of this Epistle discusses the cooperation of the churches in public contributions for common objectives. Paul, along with all the brethren with him, joins in the Epistle to "all the churches in Galatia." He commands them to "bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ." Indeed, all the *catholic epistles* provide clear proof that cooperation is at the very essence of the Christian institution. Such are some of Paul's epistles, as well as the letters of Peter, the first of John, and those of James and Jude. The foundation of such general or universal letters is the fact that all the communities of Christ constitute only one body and are individually and collectively bound to cooperate in all matters pertaining to a common salvation.

# 28. Heresy

Schisms and heresies are issues strongly condemned in the Christian Scriptures. To guard against them with appropriate care, we must contemplate and understand their true and proper scriptural attributes. We shall therefore first attempt to define them.

The term *schism* is found only *eight* times in the apostolic writings. When referring to a garment (Matt. 9:16; Mark 2:21), it is correctly translated as *rent*; when referring to a crowd of people (John 7:43; 9:16; 10:19), it is translated as *division*; when referring to the church by Paul (1 Cor. 1:10; 11:18; 12:25), it denotes *division* or *alienation* — not due to faith, doctrines, or opinions — but because of men as leaders or chiefs among the brethren. The contexts in which it is used always indicate this. It is a division concerning *internal unity,* or the union of heart and affection, merely leading to a break in visible or outward unity, and therefore condemned by the Apostle. Such are its New Testament meanings.

Schisms can exist even where there is perfect agreement in faith, doctrine, and all religious beliefs. An undue attachment to certain individuals, to the detriment of others, and partiality based on personal preferences are the true elements of schism or division as it appeared in Corinth, and as the term is used in the New Testament. Few people today can fully appreciate the force of the word *schism* in the apostolic age because very few experientially know the deep connections, the oneness of heart and soul, that prevailed in genuine Christian profession. A union formed on Christian principles — a union with Christ and his followers in views, sentiments, feelings, aims, and pursuits — a real partnership for eternity, nearly annihilated individuality itself, and inseparably cemented into one spirit all genuine members of Christ's body. Kindred drops do not more readily mingle into one mass than the souls of primitive Christians flowed together in all their aspirations, loves, joys, and interests. Hence arose the jealousy in the Apostle Paul when he first learned that certain individuals in Corinth began to attract notice and attachment simply due to personal, individual, and fleshly considerations, as leaders or chiefs in the Christian family. In these indications, he already saw the dissolution of the church. Although it was still one visible community, having one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one table, and one supreme and all-controlling interest; still, in these attachments to particular individuals, he not only saw a genuine division or rift in the hearts of the people but also foresaw that it would result in positive, actual, and visible disunion or heresy. Here we are led to inquire into the scriptural meaning of the word *heresy.*

*Hairesis,* strictly and literally indicative of *choice* or *option,* is translated as *heresy*, and is properly understood as *sect* or *faction*, and by implication, *discord* and *contention.* It is found only *nine* times in the New Testament. In Acts 5:17, it is rendered "the sect of the Sadducees;"—Acts 15:5 "the sect of the Pharisees;"—Acts 24:5, "the sect of the Nazarenes;"—Acts 24:14, "after the way which they call *heresy* (sect), so worship I," says Paul;—Acts 26:5, "after the most strict *sect* of our religion I lived a Pharisee;"—Acts 28:22. "as for this *sect* (of the Christians), we know that it is everywhere spoken against." In addition to these six occurrences, it is used twice by Paul in his letters, and once by Peter. 1 Cor. 11:19. "For there must be *heresies* (sects) among you." Gal. 5:20. "Sedition, heresies." 2 Peter 2:1. "Shall bring in damnable heresies." In the common version, it is then rendered *sect* five times and *heresy* four times.

As the word *sect* or *heresy*, found only in the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles, does not always in the former simply mean a *party* without any regard to its beliefs, the term does not inherently carry any reproach or honor — nothing virtuous or vicious. Hence, it is equally applied to Pharisees, Sadducees, Nazarenes, or Christians, without insinuating anything about the character of the party. It is only rendered *heresy* once in the "Acts," and in that instance, it should have most obviously been translated as *sect.* Paul had been accused by Tertullus (Acts 24:6) of being "a ringleader of the *sect* of the Nazarenes." Now, in defending himself against any censure in this case, he ought to have addressed the charge under the same title. This he did in the original; for in verse 5, in the indictment, and in verse 14, in his defense, we have the same word *hairesis.* How misguided, then, was it on the part of our translators and the Vulgate to have Tertullus accuse Paul of a *sect* and to have Paul defend himself against a *heresy*, when both Tertullus and Paul used the same word in their speeches as reported by Luke in the original!

In the new version, this word is, as it should be, uniformly rendered *sect.* In the Epistles, and apparently once in Acts, it is used as though it implied an idea of censure or guilt. Paul defends himself against the accusation of Tertullus. Here, then, a question arises — "Why should the term *hairesis* imply blame in its *Christian* sense, and none in its *Jewish* meaning?" We answer, Because among the Jews, sects or parties did not end, as they did among Christians, in separate communities or communions. They resembled the high and low church parties in the Episcopalian communion; or the different and numerous sects among the Roman Catholics, such as Benedictines, Franciscans, Dominicans, Jesuits, etc., which never culminate in a break of communion or cooperation as one church. Thus, the Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, etc., frequented the same temple, altar, priesthood, and united in all the same acts of worship. Not so the Jews and Samaritans: they were real *sects* in the Christian sense. Additionally, among the Jews, the bond of union was national and physical; therefore, parties could not destroy it. In contrast, with us, it is spiritual, social, and heartfelt — one faith, one hope, one spirit; and parties are destructively divisive.

To this view, there is, however, one plausible objection; and that we address in response to the question, "Why did Paul defend himself against Tertullus's accusation as implying censure if sects among the Jews were such harmless and inoffensive things?" We answer, There is no blame in the simple label of a sect, but in the ideas Tertullus connected with it. The Romans had agreed to protect the Jews in their religion, and they wished to make Paul appear an apostate from that religion in the presence of Felix — "a pestilent fellow, a mover of *sedition*, a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes" — so that he might fall outside the protection granted to the Jewish religion. This perspective is essential to understanding the wisdom of Paul's defense. He admits the charge of being a *sectary*, but in no criminal sense — worshiping the same God as they do, believing in every word of their law and Prophets, and cherishing the same hope for future life in the resurrection of the dead; thereby indicating that nothing offensive or criminal could be imputed to him for being a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.

In the Christian epistles, however, it is used in a negative sense, always connected with disapproval. This may have been the reason why the King James version changed the translation to *heresies*, or as in cases like *baptism,* *bishop,* etc., anglicized rather than directly translated. However, this is not a valid or sufficient reason, as it imposes on the English reader that *heresy* in the epistles, and *sect* in the Acts of the Apostles, represent two distinct and different concepts; and this, of course, obscures those passages and hinders a clear understanding of matters essential to our duty and happiness. The meaning, however, is not materially different in the epistles, except in the context. When the word *sect* is connected to a proper name, such as the *sect* of the Pharisees, the *sect* of the Sadducees, or the *sect* of the Christians, it is used in a neutral sense, neither implying truth nor error, good nor evil; but if it is applied to a party formed within a community that admits no division or subdivision due to its nature, leading to its corruption and destruction; then in that context, a sect is seen as destructive and condemnable. In the Epistles, it is always used in this sense and is considered alongside *factions*, being a work of the flesh, carnal and destructive, subject to the judgments of Heaven.

Still, in its scriptural application, whether used by Luke, Paul, or Peter (and it is found in no other writer), it never relates to doctrine, tenet, opinion, or faith. There is, in sacred usage, no *tenet* or *doctrine* termed *heresy* or *sect.* Hence that ecclesiastical definition, viz. — "*Heresy denotes some erroneous opinion, tenet, or doctrine obstinately held,*" is without any backing from the New Testament. *Heresy* and *heretical*, when spoken by Paul and Peter, differ vastly in meaning from the same terms used by any ancient or modern scholar or churchman.

Some argue that any doctrine causing division is heretical and thus condemnable. For the sake of argument, it may be accepted that any doctrine or action inciting division is heretical or divisive; but on that basis, it is not condemnable; because, in that sense, Jesus Christ was a heretic and his gospel a heresy: for he came to create divisions on earth, and indeed did form a sect; and consequently, his doctrine is divisive or heretical.

Now if we say Jesus was a *heretic*, and his gospel *heresy*, and his followers *sectaries*, does this not strip the word of any negative or culpable significance, making heretics, heresies, and sects innocent things? It does, regarding everyone outside Christ's kingdom or institution. But this presents the crucial distinction here: Christians, separate from Jews, Muslims, Pagans, and Infidels, are lawfully, righteously, and innocently a sect, a heresy: whereas a sect among these groups is corrupt, treasonous, and highly reproachable according to every precept, doctrine, and saying of the New Institution. Thus a man may be a Christian, or part of the sect of the Nazarenes, but not a Lutheran, a Calvinist, or an Arminian, without reproach.

Having explored the words *schisms* and *heresies*, may we not consider schism as the cause, and heresy as the effect? Or, in other words, must we not see sects as the products of schisms? The entirety of the matter suggests that separation is the outcome of alienation of heart, with alienation being the fruit of rival attachments, which generally begin in personal sympathies or antipathies in the church, leading to detaching their subjects from the body of Christ. In this regard, Paul appears to reason, 1 Cor. 11:18-19 — "There are *schisms* among you — for there must be *sects* among you, that the approved may be made manifest." The schisms in Corinth started with individual preferences for prominent teachers, such as Paul, Apollos, and Cephas. These preferences undermined that *unity of spirit,* that oneness of heart essential to one body in Christ; and this led to factions in the church, evident in the way they commemorated the supper. The same spirit in other communities ultimately resulted in visible separations and distinct sects, as seen among the professed members of Christ's body today.

Paul, in commenting on this ancient schism, further notes that there *must*, necessarily, be sects in such a state of affairs "that the *approved* may be made manifest." It is so true that all conflicts, contentions, parties, and sects originate from corruption. Sects are the outward expression of corruptions. The approved align with Christ, thus becoming evident, while the disapproved follow human leaders, likewise becoming evident. There seems to be no remedy for a corrupt and mixed community except through heresies or sects. Such arrangements are as wise and benevolent in a remedial system, as the law in the animal kingdom that brings all harmful elements to the surface, forming swellings and blemishes from those detrimental particles threatening to spoil the entire system and fatally lead to the body's ruin.

People indeed do not become enamored with Paul, Peter, and Cephas in a partisan sense until they have lost some love for Christ. Hence, the first indication of personal favoritism, or of sectarian attachment, signals the first proof of decline, backsliding, or apostasy. The partisan attachment is inherently tied to the original sin, deeply concealing within its core the initial element of hatred. Thus, we observe someone who loves Wesley for any sectarian attribute also hates Calvin proportionally due to their attachment to their leader; as one who loves Calvin for his humanism may despise Wesley for opposing them. Meanwhile, one who loves only what is Christian in both has no animosity toward either; rather, they lament the errors and failings of both. For no other reason, we should earnestly and fervently reject partyism; for it should be shunned that our disdain for one party will always correlate with our affection for its opposite; and in all such cases, both our love and hate are subject to the condemnation of God, and indeed lie under the weight of His explicit disapproval.

For this reason, it is notable that the next occurrence of the word *hairesis*, the only time it again appears in Paul's letters, immediately follows "*factions*" and precedes "*envyings*" and "*murders*" in Paul's enumeration and classification of the works of the flesh (Gal. 5:20-21), whose practitioners Paul firmly and repeatedly stated shall not "enter into the kingdom of God." He states, "The works of the flesh are evident, which are these — fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, sorcery, enmities, strifes, emulations, wrath, brawls, *factions, sects*, envyings, murders, intoxication," etc. Every sectary is, then, in Paul's judgment, a carnal person, excluded from the kingdom of God. A serious judgment indeed! How shall we make sense of it?!

It is now increasingly clear that *heresies* are not mere opinions, tenets, doctrines, or theories; for who will assert that opinions, tenets, or theories, as such, constitute works of the flesh? Or who would claim that fleshly principles are the roots or causes of mere opinions, tenets, or theories, etc.? Corrupt opinions may indeed be more easily propagated or accepted by corrupt people; but to categorize opinions or tenets, even those sectarian opinions on which some groups are formed, as works of the flesh, is to confuse mental incapacity or a lack of education with heart corruption; for nothing can be labeled a work of the flesh that does not partake of the corruptions of the heart. *Hairesis* in this context, then, denotes sects, as it consistently does throughout the New Testament.

Yet the question resurfaces: Are all religious sects works of the flesh? Paul makes no exceptions. We cannot either. He is not discussing philosophical, political, or foreign factions and sects; but those belonging to the Christian institution. Among the Jews, Paul himself was a *Pharisee*; within the political classes, he was a *Roman*; but in religion, he was a Christian; not a Calvinist, Arminian, or Methodist; but a Christian. Paul himself, in tracing the history of sectaries, or of the founders and leaders of religious parties, attributes all their zeal and effort to the stomach rather than to conscience or love of truth. "Mark those," he says, "who cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you received, and avoid them; for such people do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but rather their own *belly*; and through flattery and nice words, they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting." Surely such sectarians and sects are "the works of the flesh."

However, we should define a *factionist* and a *sectary*, since nowadays we have some sectarians who are not factionists, and some factionists and factions that are more than mere sectaries. The factionist, or as Paul calls him, the "heretic", creates the faction. The faction consists of those who join him. Ordinary sectaries are those simply led by the heretic, swayed by his flatteries and appealing words, without any ulterior motive influencing their actions. Many sectarians genuinely believe that their party is the true and only church of Christ, and they therefore sincerely adhere to it. There are others who think that no party embodies the church of Christ, but that He has a church across all parties — an invisible church — to which they believe they belong, and therefore they associate with others of a similar mindset in all parties as far as known. These differ significantly from the schismatics, heretics, and factionists of Paul’s time. Those either created, or sought to maintain, a party or a sect; and all such individuals are corrupt, fleshly people; for their pride in their opinions, ambition, or love of money drives them to create or sustain a faction or sect favorable to their objectives and interests. These individuals serve their own desires and focus on earthly matters. Yet a large number of sectarians are merely following, as they presume, Jesus Christ and His Apostles, under the names and tenets of Luther, Calvin, Wesley, etc. They are unwittingly the mere followers of men, as they do not examine anything for themselves through a constant and habitual reference to the Bible.

Now, what might be the levels of carnal and worldly influence that keep them there, and what might be the levels of long-suffering and forgiveness exercised toward them from heaven, I do not claim to dogmatize; but it is a deep and rational conviction derived from the most impartial examination of sacred scriptures — from the clearest testimonies of the Holy Spirit, speaking through the words of Prophets and Apostles — that the factionist — the individual who forms a party, and he who strives to maintain it, is certainly earthly, sensual, and demoniacal; and, as such, not part of the kingdom of God.

The Christian party is "built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, and on Jesus the Messiah, himself the chief cornerstone," therefore *on the Christian Scriptures alone*; not, indeed, in opposition to the Jewish Scriptures, but as the development and full revelation of all that pertains to Christ and his kingdom contained within those scriptures. All other parties that diverge in any way from the Christian party are built upon some mixture — some creed, formula, or human institution that complements the apostolic laws and customs. This mixture defines the party. For instance, certain elements of the Apostles' doctrine, combined with particular views of Calvin, result in the compound called Calvinism. Similarly, a combination of elements from Luther's opinions with the Apostles' teaching creates Lutheranism. And a combination of aspects of Wesley's speculations with certain parts of the New Testament results in what is called Methodism. The Christian elements in these combinations, as far as they are not neutralized by the human mixture, create the Christians among them; while the mixture creates the sectary. Remove everything that belongs to the founder of the sect in each of these parties, and they would certainly merge to form one community.

Now, we do not assume that creating a new Protestant party carries the same guilt as the original formation of the Roman Catholic, the Greek, or any of the ancient sects. The modern sects have emerged with the intent of reverting to primitive Christianity; the ancient sects arose directly from the thirst for power — from carnal, selfish, and worldly motives. But now, since we have significantly partaken of the bitterness and gall brought by sects and parties; and learned the cause, cure, and prevention of sectarianism, it is lamentable for all who sustain the old markers of conflict or lay the groundwork for new rivalries, partialities, and antipathies, allowing them to proliferate and corrupt many, hinder the progress of the gospel abroad, and foster the spirit of infidelity at home.

There remains another occurrence of *hairesis* (sect) in Peter's writings, not yet formally analyzed. We shall now specifically consider it. This Apostle states, "There will be false teachers among you, who will privately introduce *destructive sects*, denying even the Lord who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves; and many will follow their corrupt ways." Paul, in his farewell to the Ephesians, also speaks of "grievous wolves ravaging the flock and of men rising from their own group to entice disciples after them, speaking perverse things." From these hints, we learn that both Apostles, Paul and Peter, foresaw the emergence of sectarians and sects; and both of them, notably, connected sects with sectarian teachers: for all sects have been birthed by false teachers or corrupt individuals. It seems that sectarians occupy the same role under Christ as false Prophets did under Moses. Should we infer the danger of continuing religious sects, or would it be redundant to prove that everyone who builds a party shares in the crime of those who established it?

It is imperative for all who wish to be approved by the Lord at his coming to actively work to purge and cleanse the Christian profession of every root and branch of sectarianism, and to strive to eliminate those destructive sects that have served as a Pandora's box for humankind; that have filled the profession with hypocrites, the world with infidels, and thwarted the conversion of both Jews and Gentiles to the Christian faith for many centuries.

Finally, while seeking to abolish the old sects, let us be cautious not to form a new one. This could be done by either adding to or subtracting from the apostolic constitution even a single item. Our platform must be as long and as broad as the New Testament. Every person that the Apostles would receive, if present, must be received by us; therefore, the one faith, one Lord, one baptism, one hope, one body, one Spirit, and one God and Father of all must be the basis for one, and only one table.

Factionists, or opinionists, or those who seek to attach individuals to themselves due to their opinions, talents, or personal attributes, whatever they may be, should be seen as the very roots of bitterness in the Christian church — seeking their own interests, honors, and profits, rather than the things of Jesus Christ. Such spirits gave rise to ancient schisms and sects; and by allied spirits that every generation can provide, they remain alive. Most such individuals have little power to effect much change; but occasionally, one will rise and succeed in drawing away disciples after him. We can propose no better remedies or preventives than those instructed by the Apostles. Let us hold fast to their traditions; contend only for the faith; allow differences of opinion; permit no dogmatists; support none of the followers of Diotrephes; and walk in love, guided by that wisdom which is "first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be persuaded, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy."

From the preceding deductions, it should become clear to all that we require neither telescopes nor microscopes to discern *heresies* in the New Testament sense of that word. They are simply sects — clear, palpable sects and parties. Every party in Christendom, irrespective of its tenets, opinions, or practices, is a *heresy*, a schism — unless a party stands exactly on the Apostles' ground. In that case, it mirrors the old sect of the Nazarenes, later called *Christians*, and all others are guilty before the Lord and must be condemned for their opposition to Christ's own party; a party to which we belong, provided we uphold all, and only all, apostolic traditions, and build upon the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible.

# 2. The Bible

One God, one moral system, one Bible. If nature is a system, religion is no less so. God is "a God of order," which means He is a God of system. Nature and religion, the products of the same supreme intelligence, reflect the image of one Father; twin sisters of the same Divine parentage. There is an intellectual and a moral universe as clearly defined as the system of material nature. Man belongs to all three. He is an animal, intellectual, and moral being. *Sense* is his guide in nature, *faith* in religion, *reason* in both. The Bible considers man primarily in his spiritual and eternal relationships. It tells the history of nature only as necessary to show man his origin and destiny; for it views nature and the universe only in relation to man's body, soul, and spirit.

The Bible is to the intellectual and moral world of man what the sun is to the planets in our solar system: the fountain and source of light and life, spiritual and eternal. There is not a spiritual idea in all of humanity that is not drawn from the Bible. Just as a philosopher will never find an independent sunbeam in nature, a theologian will never find a spiritual concept in man independent of **The One Best Book**.

The Bible, comprising the Old and New Testaments in Hebrew and Greek, contains a complete and perfect revelation of God and His will, adapted to man as he currently is. It speaks of man as he was and also as he will be in the future; but it focuses on man *as he is* and *as he ought to be*, being its unique and appropriate theme. It does not serve as a treatise on man as he was or as he will be, but on man as he is and as he ought to be; not in physical, astronomical, geological, political, or metaphysical terms, but as he is and ought to be *morally* and *religiously*.

The words of the Bible contain all the ideas within them;—these words, when correctly understood, will lead to clear understanding of the ideas. The words and sentences of the Bible must be translated, interpreted, and understood according to the same set of laws and principles of interpretation that are applied to other ancient writings; for when God spoke to man in his own language, He spoke just as one person converses with another, using clear, agreed-upon, and well-established meanings of terms. This is essential to its nature as a revelation from God; otherwise, it would not be a revelation at all but would always require a class of inspired individuals to explain and reveal its true meaning to humanity.

We have frequently and extensively written about the principles and rules of interpretation, which are of essential importance and utility in this current generation that often relies on mysticism and allegorization. From our earlier writings, we will here extract only the core rules of interpretation, derived from comprehensive and well-organized premises, which are fully supported by the leading translators and most distinguished critics and commentators of the last and present century.

**Rule 1**. When opening any book in the sacred Scriptures, *first consider the historical circumstances of the book. This includes the order, the title, the author, the date, the place, and the occasion of it*.

The *order* in historical writings is quite significant; for example, whether it is the first, second, or third of the five books of Moses, or any other sequence of narratives, or even epistolary communication.

The *title* is also significant, as it sometimes conveys the *purpose* of the book. For example, *Exodus*—the departure of Israel from Egypt; *Acts of the Apostles*, etc.

The unique qualities of the *author*—the time period in which he lived—his style and expression, illustrate his writings. The date, place, and occasion are obviously necessary for the correct application of anything in the book.

**Rule 2**. When examining the contents of any book, regarding precepts, promises, exhortations, etc., *take note of who is speaking and under what dispensation they function*. Is the speaker a Patriarch, a Jew, or a Christian? *Consider also the individuals being addressed; their biases, characters, and religious affiliations*. Are they Jews or Christians—believers or non-believers—approved or disapproved? This rule is essential for the proper application of every command, promise, threat, admonition, or exhortation in the Old Testament or New.

**Rule 3**. To understand the meaning of what is commanded, promised, taught, etc., *the same philological principles, derived from the nature of language, or the same interpretation laws that apply to other books must also be applied to the language of the Bible*.

**Rule 4**. *Common usage, which can only be determined by evidence, must always establish the meaning of any word that has only one meaning*;—but when words have multiple meanings according to evidence (i.e., the dictionary), whether literal or figurative, *the scope, context, or parallel passages must determine the meaning*: for if common usage, the author's intent, the context, and parallel passages fail, there can be no certainty in the interpretation of language.

**Rule 5**. *In all figurative language, determine the point of comparison and judge the nature and type of the figure based on that point*.

**Rule 6**. In interpreting symbols, types, allegories, and parables, this rule is paramount: *identify the point being illustrated; for the comparison should never extend beyond that point—to all attributes, qualities, or circumstances of the symbol, type, allegory, or parable*.

**Rule 7**. For the beneficial and sanctifying understanding of the Oracles of God, the following rule is indispensable—

*We must come within the understanding distance*.

There is a distance that may be called *the speaking distance* or the *hearing distance*; beyond which the voice does not reach, and the ear does not hear. To truly hear another, we must enter that circle within which the voice is clearly audible.

We can rightly state that in relation to God, there exists an understanding distance. All beyond that distance cannot truly understand God; all within it can easily comprehend Him in all matters of piety and morality. God Himself is the center of that circle, and humility is its circumference.

The wisdom of God is as evident in adapting the light of the Sun of Righteousness to our spiritual or moral vision as it is in adjusting the light of day to our eyes. The light reaches us without any effort on our part; but we must open our eyes, and when our eyes are sound, we enjoy the natural light of heaven. There exists a sound eye in regard to spiritual light as well as in relation to material light. Now, while the philological principles and rules of interpretation enable many people to be skilled in biblical criticism, and in the interpretation of words and sentences, many do not perceive or appreciate the *things* represented by those words; the sound eye contemplates the things themselves and is captivated by the moral scenes that the Bible reveals.

The moral *soundness* of vision consists of having the eyes of understanding fixed solely on God Himself, His approval, and His kind affection for us. It is sometimes referred to as a *single* eye because it seeks one thing supremely. Therefore, everyone who opens the Book of God with *one aim*, with a singular ardent desire—solely to know the will of God; for such a person, understanding God is easy: for the Bible is designed to illuminate such individuals, and only such, with the beneficial knowledge of heavenly and divine matters.

Humility of mind, or what is effectively the same, disregard for all earthly superiority, prepares the mind for the reception of this light; or, equivalently, opens the ears to hear the voice of God. Amidst the clamor of all arguments from flesh, the world, and Satan, a person may be so deaf that they cannot hear the still small voice of God's love. However, by distancing themselves from pride, greed, and false ambition; from the love of the world; and by entering that circle, whose circumference is genuine humility, and whose center is God Himself—the voice of God is distinctly heard and clearly understood. All within this circle are taught by God; all outside it fall under the influence of the wicked one. 'God resists the proud, but He gives grace to the humble.'

Therefore, one who seeks to interpret the Oracles of God for the salvation of their soul must approach this volume with the humility and teachability of a child, and meditate on it day and night. Like Mary, he must sit at the Master's feet and listen to the words falling from His lips. To such a person, there is an assurance of understanding, a certainty of knowledge, to which the learned man alone never attained, and which the mere critic never experienced.

The Bible is a book of facts, not of opinions, theories, abstract generalities, nor of verbal definitions. It is a book of profound facts, grand and sublime beyond description. These facts reveal God and man and contain within them the reasons for all piety and righteousness; or what is commonly referred to as religion and morality. The meaning of the Biblical facts is the true biblical doctrine. History is therefore the framework pursued in both Testaments; for testimony primarily pertains to faith, while reasoning pertains to understanding. History, as we say, relates to facts—and religion springs from them. Hence, the history of the past and the anticipations of the future, or what are usually called history and prophecy, constitute exactly four-fifths of all the volumes of inspiration.

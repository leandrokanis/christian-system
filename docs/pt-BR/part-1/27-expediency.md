# 27. Expediency

"Not all lawful things are expedient, because not all lawful things build up." Thus did Paul essentially affirm. A position with a licentious tendency if not properly qualified. As defined by its author, it is perfectly safe. He only suggested that there are many things he might lawfully do that were not *expedient* for him to do. For instance, he could have married a wife, eaten the flesh of either Jewish or pagan sacrifices, or drunk the wine of their libations, according to Christian law; but given the specific circumstances of his unique vocation and locations, it would have been inexpedient for him to do these things.

Law itself is, indeed, at best just an expedient — a means considered appropriate at the time of its establishment for some rational end. However, due to the mutability of circumstances, laws often fail to serve as the best means to the proposed ends; thus, they are abolished, or temporarily suspended. This holds true for all laws and institutions that prescribe the *modes* and *forms* of action, whether in religion or morality. Moral laws, properly speaking, are indeed immutable; because the principle of every moral law is *love,* which can never cease to be not just a way and means, but the *only way and means* to rational, human happiness. Positive precepts, however, which prescribe the *forms* of religious and moral action, issued from God Himself, have been changed, and may be changed again, while all elements of piety and morality remain immutable. For example, it would now be considered immoral to marry a biological sister; yet, for a time, this was permitted by divine authority. The continuation of that practice became inexpedient, leading to a change in the law.

Therefore, there exists *a law of expediency,* as well as the expediency of law. This law of expediency, which serves as the basis for the expediency of law in divine governance, has occasionally been elevated above the precepts prescribing the forms of religious and moral action, as seen in the case of David eating the showbread and the priests profaning the Sabbath through temple work. Indeed, such cases are exceedingly rare; and it is rare for reasoners to be able to safely decide when a particular precept prescribing the *form* of action may be waived or suspended for the sake of the action itself. Moreover, it is highly questionable whether, under the more perfected institution of Christianity, the law of expediency can ever conflict with any moral or religious precept of the New Covenant.

Still, many matters remain subject to the law of expediency, concerning which no precepts are found in apostolic writings. The goal of this chapter is to ascertain these. They are, in essence, actions or forms of action that could not or did not need to be reduced to specific precepts; therefore, they are not about faith, piety, or morality, since whatever pertains to the faith, worship, or morality of Christianity is both possible and necessary to be proclaimed; and is expressly and fully articulated in the sacred scriptures. The laws of expediency have no role in determining articles of faith, acts of worship, or principles of morality. All these require a "*thus saith the Lord*" in clear statements, and the sacred writings have defined and settled them plainly. However, in other matters that may be considered circumstantial to the gospel and the church of Christ, the people of God are left to their own discretion, as well as to the capabilities and needs of society.

Indeed, many things of vital importance to the well-being and prosperity of the kingdom of Christ are left to the law of expediency. A few examples will suffice: — Can anyone think of a matter more consequential than the safeguarding of the apostolic writings, the multiplication of copies, their translation into various languages, and the means of distributing them throughout the world? Now, who can point to a positive or specific precept regarding any of these four pivotal issues? Scribes or copyists, paper-makers, printers, book-binders, and vendors of the oracles of God are as unknown to the apostolic writers as are mail services, post offices, railroads, and steam engines. Furthermore, the kingdom of Christ has been so negligent regarding some of these matters that it lacks a *received copy* of the Living Oracles at this hour. We Americans and the English have a *received version* authorized by a king; but we do not have a **received original** authorized by any king or civil or ecclesiastical government. A startling fact indeed! But who would dare deny it?

Next in importance are meeting houses, baptisteries, tables of the Lord, the symbolic loaf and cup, times of gathering, arrangements for the day, etc. Acts of Parliament, decrees from synods and councils exist, but there are no apostolic enactments, statutes, or laws for any of these important items. There are neither precepts nor precedents in the New Testament for building, hiring, buying, or owning a meeting house; for constructing a baptismal pool, font, or bath; concerning chancel, altar, table, leavened or unleavened bread, chalice, cup, or tankard, and many other items of equal significance.

There is no law, rule, or precedent for the *manner* of taking the Lord's Supper, nor any indication of the quantity of bread and wine each participant should use; nothing is mentioned about who should partake first, or how it shall be passed from one person to another. All these matters are discretionary and given to the prudence and good sense of the Christian communities — in other words, to the law of expediency.

Regarding these and many other such matters, nothing is specifically enacted, prescribed, or decided by apostolic authority; but all necessary actions are commanded in clear and broad precepts, or through striking and clear apostolic precedents. General laws and precepts covering the entire spectrum of religious and moral action are often found in the words of the Lord and his ministers of the New Institution, from which our duties and obligations can be clearly determined. That "marriage is honorable in all" is clearly taught; yet who has ever read a verse concerning the *manner* in which the most important of all social institutions is to be conducted? No age is specified at which the covenant may be established or ratified — no time in life is prescribed for its fulfillment — nothing is mentioned about who shall officiate, the formula, the witnesses, or the records, etc. Moreover, notably, there is no table, law, or statute in all the New Covenant indicating who may or may not enter into that relationship based on any principle of consanguinity or affinity. By the consent of the Christian church, the Jewish law applies in this matter.

The communion of saints among all Christian churches — the cooperation of churches as one holy nation, a kingdom of priests, as a special people in all common interests and benefits — an effective gospel ministry, rightfully and honorably supported by the entire community — are matters clearly and fully taught by both apostolic precept and authority; however, the forms, means and methods by which these ends are to be achieved are left to the law of expediency.

Yet a practical and crucial question arises, namely — *Who shall ascertain and interpret this law of expediency?* We all agree that expedients should be chosen with regard to times, seasons, and other circumstances. Changes in these inevitably alter expedients. The mariner's compass, the art of printing, new modes of travel, banks and their commercial operations, new government forms, etc., have transformed social order and all human expedients. The law of expediency is about adopting the best available means to achieve any given end. However, this is a matter that the wisdom and good sense of individuals and communities must decide. This is not, nor can it be, a matter of standing revelation. If the church were always united in opinion as in faith — if all accumulated wisdom provided a uniform resolution on all such matters, then the entire church, by one voice, would ascertain the law of expediency on any specific issue. Yet this is not the case. No group of individuals — apostles, teachers, laypersons — has ever agreed on questions of expediency. Paul and Barnabas disagreed and differed, *without any breach of communion,* on a question of this sort. Thus arises the need for the spirit of concession, subordination, bearing with one another, and submitting to one another. When two differing views on expediency are held by two parties, one party must yield, or else there would be two distinct systems of operation, ultimately leading to two distinct groups. According to the law of expediency, therefore, those who are minors in age, experience, or numbers, must yield to those who are majors in age, experience, or numbers. But since numbers are assumed to reflect ratios of age, wisdom, and knowledge, it is expedient that a clearly determined majority of those tasked with deciding any matter shall interpret the law of expediency; in other words, the minority should peacefully and willingly acquiesce to the decisions of the majority. From the dawn of social agreements until now, no other principle of cooperation, nor any other law of expediency, can secure the interests, unity, harmony, and strength of any people, except that of the few submitting to the many.

He who asks for unanimity seeks something seldom achievable among a small number of individuals. He seeks the liberty of one or two to govern or control an entire community — for the governance of a minority, however small, over a majority, however large. This is, in essence, though not formally stated or often intentionally sought, the demand of all advocates for unanimity in determining or interpreting the law of expediency in any specific case. The law of expediency dictates that a majority of seniors shall make decisions in all cases regarding what is most expedient for achieving any of the ends commanded in the Christian Institution, the means of which are not divinely ordained in the written laws of that institution; and that the minority shall cheerfully and conscientiously accept such decisions.

*The law of love is the supreme law of religion, morality, and expediency. No code of laws, without it, can make or keep any community pure, peaceful, and happy; and, with it, we only require, in most matters, general laws.* — This is the essence and lifeblood of the Christian Institution. We cannot love by law, but we can walk in love with no law other than that of love. The Christian system regards love as supreme and makes no arrangements or provisions for holding together a worldly, selfish, self-willed population. Better such a confederation should splinter into as many fragments as there are individuals, propelled by the repelling force of selfishness, than to be held together by all the laws of expediency from Noah to John Wesley.

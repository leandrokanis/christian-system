# 11. The Attributes of a True Sin-Offering

A single action or event often involves, for better or worse, a family, a nation, an empire. Who can measure the effects or implications of the rise or fall of a Caesar, a Hannibal, or a Napoleon? A single victory, like that of Zama or Waterloo; a single revolution, like those of England or America, can sometimes determine the fortunes of the world. Neither actions nor events can be truly understood without considering their implications and tendencies on every person and thing they come into contact with. The relationships, connections, and critical dependencies in which people and actions exist are often so numerous and varied that it is rarely, if ever, within human capability to calculate the consequences or the significance of even one of the more prominent actions of one's life.

Who could have anticipated, or who can measure, the moral or political implications of Joseph being sold to a group of Ishmaelites — of Moses being placed in a basket of reeds on the Nile — of David being anointed as king of Israel — of the division of the twelve tribes under Rehoboam — of Judas’ betrayal, Stephen's martyrdom, Paul’s conversion, Constantine the Great's rise to power, Julian's apostasy, the crusades against the Turks, Luther's reformation, the revival of learning, or any of the great movements of our time? How difficult, then, is it to estimate the rebellion of Satan, the fall of Adam, or the death of Christ, in all their implications for the universe's destiny!

Before a remedy for sin can be devised or appreciated, understanding its implications for God and humanity, for time and eternity, for heaven and earth, is an essential prerequisite. But who possesses this knowledge, or what uninspired person can attain it? At best, we know only in part; therefore, we can only partially explain anything. How difficult, then, is it to form a satisfactory view of sin and its remedy — of the fall of Adam and the death of Christ!

However, it would greatly enhance our understanding of Christ’s death and illustrate the nature and purpose of *sin-offerings* if we could obtain accurate and scriptural views of sin in its necessary consequences, or in its significant implications for the universe. Indeed, some understanding of these aspects of sin is crucial for us to perceive and appreciate the wisdom, justice, and grace of the Christian system. It is not enough that we hold a few vague and unclear notions of its tendencies or of the relationship it creates with God, ourselves, and others: we must have clear and definite views of the relationships in which God stands to us, and we to Him and to one another, and how sin affects us all in these relationships: for it undoubtedly affects each of us differently in all these relationships.

God exists in various relationships to the intellectual and moral creation. He is our Father, our Lawgiver, and our King. Now, His feelings as a father, as well as His character as a lawgiver and sovereign, are equally implicated in the aspects and implications of sin. The influence of sin upon ourselves is also diverse and multifaceted. It affects the heart, the conscience, the entire soul and body of humanity. It alienates our affections and even breeds hatred in our minds towards both God and fellow humans. As an ancient adage puts it, "We hate those we have injured;" and having offended God our Father, we are, for that very reason, filled with enmity against Him. It also oppresses and contaminates the conscience with guilt and fear, and enslaves our passions while leading to the destruction of the body. Furthermore, it alienates people from each other, weakens the authority of the law, and nullifies its usefulness; and, if unrestrained, would ultimately overturn the throne and governance of God. If not checked and subdued, it would fill the universe with chaos and disorder — with universal misery and ruin.

To go no further into detail, we can observe on the premises already before us: — 1st. That every sin wounds the affection of our heavenly Father — 2d. Insults and dishonors His law and authority in the estimation of His other subjects — 3d. Alienates our hearts from Him — 4th. Oppresses our conscience with guilt and fear — 5th. Isolates us from society through its morbid selfishness and disregard for others — 6th. Leads to further infractions and habitual violations of right — And, 7th. Subjects us to shame and contempt — our bodies to dust, and ourselves to everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord.

Not as the complete account but as a sample of the loss incurred and the harm done by our transgression, these seven points have been specified. They merely show how many aspects sin must be considered from before we can form a just assessment of a suitable and sufficient sin offering or remedy.

Now, to the extent that we have been able to trace the tendencies and implications of transgression in the above observations, we must find in the *sin offering* a remedy and an antidote that fully addresses all these aspects; otherwise, it will be entirely worthless and ineffective in the eyes of enlightened reason, as well as in the righteous judgment of God, to expiate sins, to eliminate it, and to prevent its recurrence.

Do we need to show that man himself cannot provide such a sin offering? Do we need to reintroduce Micah's question — "With what shall I come before the Lord, and bow down before the Most High God? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?" Will remorse for the past, and future improvement, restore things to how they were; bring back the murdered dead; repair lost fortunes, and restore broken lives? Will tears, groans, or anguish honor a violated law, uphold a righteous government, vindicate the Divine character, and prevent future wrongdoings? Have they ever done it? Can they ever do it? Surely, we may be excused from trying to prove that we possess neither a tear, nor a sigh, nor an anguish, nor a lamb, nor a kid of our own making, to offer to the Lord, even if such a sacrifice were sufficient to meet all aspects of the situation!

Every wrongdoing, even the least, like eating a forbidden apple, subjects the transgressor to destruction. One sin committed by one man has implicated the entire human race in death. Justice demands the life of the transgressor, even in the very mildest tones of insulted justice. Hence, in the law regarding typical sin offerings, it is written: "The *life* of the flesh is in the *blood:* and I have given it to you upon the altar, to make an atonement for your souls: **for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.**" [1] However, such blood, such lives as the law required, could not, according to Paul and Common Sense, take away sin. They could only foreshadow a *life* and a *blood* that could truly, justly, and honorably expiate it. Thus, *the death of Christ* is thrust upon our attention by the law, by the prophets, and by the necessity of the case, enlightened Reason being in the lead, as the only real, true, and proper sin-atoning offering. It indeed addresses not only the above seven points but all others that have occurred to the human mind; and thus secures the unity and harmony of all things on earth and in heaven, bound in the unbreakable ties of an everlasting brotherhood.

1. "In bringing many sons to glory," it soothes and delights the wounded love of our kind and benevolent heavenly Father—
2. "It magnifies and honors" His violated law and insulted government—
3. It reconciles our hearts thoroughly and forever to God, as an undeniable proof and pledge of His wonderful and incomprehensible love for us—
4. It effectively relieves our conscience by "cleansing us from all sin," producing within us a divine serenity, a peace and joy "unspeakable and full of glory"—
5. It also reconciles us to our fellows and fills us with brotherly love and universal goodwill because it unites us all in faith, hope, and joy, as joint heirs of immortality and eternal life—
6. It serves as the most effective deterrent against new violations of divine law and powerfully deters from sin by revealing its diabolical nature and terrible consequences; highlighting, through God’s only begotten and beloved Son, the impossibility of escaping the just and retributive punishment from insulted and indignant Heaven — and
7. It is a ransom from death, a redemption from the grave, such a deliverance from the guilt, pollution, power, and punishment of sin, that greatly elevates the children of God beyond all that they could have achieved or enjoyed under the first covenant. It presents a new creation to our view — new heavens, new earth, new bodies, new life, new joys, new glories. He who conquered death by dying, who now sits on the throne, says, "Behold, I make all things new." "He has become the Author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him."

Let no one think that in this illustration of the aspects in which sin and sin offerings must be considered before we can rationally assess the necessity, appropriateness, and sufficiency of Christ's death, we have attempted to provide a complete view of these aspects. We are not equipped for such a task. Life is too short, and our opportunities too limited, to understand all the implications of transgression upon ourselves, the throne and governance of God, and His other subjects. We only intend to provide a sample of the points to be addressed in an appropriate sin offering. These render it impossible for all human, angelic, or created mediators, victims, or sacrifices to expiate sin. To the extent that we can grasp this marvelous subject, we are increasingly convinced that nothing less than the voluntary sacrifice of the Son of God could take away sin and make it both just, merciful, honorable, and safe, on the part of His God and Father, to forgive and save one of His rebellious race. Nor would it have been just, in our view, to compel Him to bear our iniquities, or to suffer the just for the unjust; to inflict, upon an innocent person, the consequences of our offenses; but it was both just and kind on the part of our heavenly Father to accept for us the voluntary surrender of His Son, as a willing sacrifice for our sins. "Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!"

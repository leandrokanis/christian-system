# 18. Conversion and Regeneration

The change that is completed through immersion is sometimes referred to in sacred terms as "*being quickened,*" "*made alive,*" "*passing from death to life,*" "*being born again,*" "*having risen with Christ,*" "*turning to the Lord,*" "*being enlightened,*" "*conversion,*" "*reconciliation,*" and "*repentance unto life.*" These terms, like the words propitiation, atonement, reconciliation, expiation, and redemption, which express the various aspects of Christ's death, highlight the different relationships in which this significant change, sometimes referred to as a "new creation," can be understood. The complete transformation brought about in a person by the Christian faith consists of four components: â€” a change of views, a change of affections, a change of state, and a change of life. Now, regarding each of these individually or in combination, it is referred to by different names. 

As a change of *views,* it is called "being enlightened"; "Once you were darkness, now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of the light"; "After you were enlightened," etc. As a change of *affections,* it is called "being reconciled"; thus, "For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved through His life." As a change of *state,* it is called "being quickened," "passing from death to life," "being born again," "having risen with Christ," "And you *he has quickened* who were dead in trespasses and sins," "By this we know that we have *passed from death to life,* because we love the brethren," "Being *born again,* not of corruptible, but of incorruptible seed, the word of God, which lives and abides forever." "If you be," or "since you *are risen with Christ,* set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth." As a change of *life,* it is referred to as "repentance unto life," "turning to the Lord," and "conversion"; "Then God granted to the Gentiles repentance to life." "And all who dwelt in Lydda and Saron saw Eneas and *turned to the Lord.*" "Except you be converted and become as children, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven." "When you are converted, strengthen your brethren." "He who converts a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins." 

Great confusion has arisen within the Christian community from conflating these terms, treating one as synonymous with all the others. Take, for example, the debate surrounding *regeneration*; as if that word were used in sacred Scripture to refer to the entirety of the change brought about by the Christian faith; whereas, in strict propriety, it is never used alone in the Bible to represent any part of this change, much less the whole. We find the phrase "*washing of regeneration*" once, in contrast to the "renewal of the Holy Spirit," (Titus 3:5) but never by itself as a representation of this four-fold change. However, suppose it's allowed that the term *regeneration* might be equivalent to "*being born again,*" even then it could only reflect part of this transformation in terms of mere *state:* for the metaphor of a new birth pertains only to admission into a family or nation; it does not encompass the process of quickening or bringing to life the individual being admitted. It can, therefore, rightly apply only to the fourth aspect of the change proposed and achieved by the gospel of salvation. Being *born again* is, or may be, the *effect* of a change of views, a change of affections; or it may be the *cause* of a change of life; but it is certain that it is not identical with any of them and cannot represent all of them simultaneously. 

But could it not encompass them all? It is impossible: because no matter how we might extend the analogy and presume it to include its causes, it cannot also encompass its effects. If it were to include a change of views, a change of affections, and a change of state, it cannot simultaneously include a change of life or character. We should therefore use this term in its strict and scriptural sense if we wish to avoid the substantial confusion surrounding this topic. The error of this confusion lies in making *regeneration* equivalent to the entire transformation instead of just one-fourth of it, causing the community to be continually misled and searching for the attributes of conversion within the new birth or vice versa, and the same applies to all others. Being born again is not *conversion,* nor is it a *change of views,* nor a *change of affections,* but a *change of state.* It is indeed true that for the person who is born again, we may infer a change of views, a change of heart, and we may surmise a change of character, and we can therefore say that he is enlightened, renewed in heart, converted as well as born again; but this leeway regarding the *person,* the subject of the change, does not apply when discussing the *change* itself. A Christian is, indeed, one whose views are enlightened, whose heart is renewed, whose relations to God and the moral universe are changed, and whose manner of life aligns with righteousness and true holiness.

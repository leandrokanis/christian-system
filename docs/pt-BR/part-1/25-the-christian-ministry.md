# 25. The Christian Ministry

"He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for *the work of the ministry,* for the edifying of the body of Christ; till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ," etc. For the establishment of the Christian institution, extraordinary officers were needed. This was also true in the Jewish tradition, and it holds for every institution, human and divine. However, once an institution is established, it only requires an ordinary ministry or administration of its affairs. All the extraordinary gifts granted to Moses, and to the Apostles and Prophets of the Gospel institution, ceased when these institutions were fully developed and established. Still, a regular and constant ministry was needed among the Jews, and is still needed among Christians; and this necessity comes from divine authority.

Natural gifts for a natural state of affairs, and supernatural gifts for a supernatural condition, are necessary and appropriate in the wisdom of both God and man. Thus, even in the apostolic age, there were officers with, as well as without, miraculous abilities. "Having, then, gifts differing according to the office, or grace that is given to us — if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the measure of our faith; or ministry, let us attend to our ministry; he that teaches, on teaching; he that exhorts, on exhortation; he that gives, with simplicity; he that rules, with diligence." God has therefore conferred various gifts on the church for the effective administration of its affairs. He has placed in it "*helps* and *governments,*" in addition to Apostles and Prophets.

The standing and unchanging ministry of the Christian community comprises Bishops, Deacons, and Evangelists. There is only one order for each of these, though they possess a wide variety of gifts. There have been bishops, deacons, and evangelists with both ordinary and extraordinary gifts. Yet, the office remains, now and always, the same. In ancient times, official and unofficial persons sometimes possessed miraculous gifts. Those in high office were generally the most notably endowed with extraordinary powers. Superficial readers have sometimes concluded that since bishops, deacons, and especially evangelists frequently possessed these manifestations of the Holy Spirit, the cessation of those gifts also meant the termination of the offices themselves. This is a significant error. Officers are necessary so long as there are offices or services to be performed. Just as the human body requires sight, hearing, and touch, it must have eyes, ears, and hands. Similarly, as long as the Christian body is organized, with many services to perform, it must have organs or officers to help it function and operate in society.

Indeed, there are as many offices in any body as there are services to be performed for or by it. This is the root and reason for all the offices throughout God's universe. Our planet requires various celestial services. Hence, the sun, moon, and stars act as celestial officers ministering to it. The eye, the ear, the tongue, the hand, and the foot serve the same purpose within the human body, fulfilling essential roles in its vital interests and enjoyment; and through these organs, it performs important functions for other bodies.

Experience, as well as observation, has taught us that "practice makes perfect," and that "whatever is everyone’s business is no one's business." Consequently, the custom arose among people to assign certain offices to specific individuals. The philosophy behind such elections and appointments is based on the fact that specialized services are best performed by individuals specifically designated for them.

Since the Christian system is a perfect system, it wisely provides for its own continuity and prosperity by creating all necessary offices and filling them with suitable individuals. We have stated that these offices are three and perpetual due to their necessary existence. *Bishops,* whose role is to preside over, instruct, and edify the community — to nurture the church of the Lord with knowledge and understanding — and to watch over their souls as those who must give an account to the Lord at His appearing and His kingdom, make up the first class. *Deacons,* or servants — whether referred to as treasurers, almoners, stewards, door-keepers, or messengers, constitute the second. The term *deacon* originally included all public servants, though it is now most commonly confined to one or two classes; often incorrectly, to those who tend only to the temporal interests of the community. They are distinguished individuals, called and commissioned by the church, (and thus always accountable to it,) to serve in any of these roles. Evangelists, however, while a class of public officials established by the church, do not directly serve it; rather, they are sent out into the world and form the third class of officials within the Christian system.

Because there is more scrutiny by some regarding the third class of Evangelists than there is over Bishops or Deacons, we shall take the opportunity to discuss more explicitly and thoroughly the nature and necessity, as well as the authority of this office. Evangelists, as the term indicates, are individuals devoted to preaching the word, making converts, and planting churches. It appears only three times in the New Testament; however, the verb *to evangelize* appears in several forms nearly sixty times in that text. "To evangelize" and "to do the work of an evangelist" are phrases of equal meaning, indicating the same duties, rights, and privileges.

Among the roles encompassed by apostleship, none required more diverse endowments than that of the Evangelist. The gift of tongues was among the qualifications needed for those who first undertook this work after the ascension. However, the qualifications for this office, regarding the gift of tongues or knowledge of language, are not rigidly fixed. It depends on the area of labor assigned to the Evangelist, whether they need to speak one language or many. Their task is to proclaim the word clearly and persuasively — to baptize all believers or converts from their ministry — and to plant and organize churches wherever necessary; and then teach them to observe the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.

Take, for example, the account given by Luke of Philip the Evangelist, one of the first to bear that title. After his role as a minister in the Jerusalem church was vacated due to the community's dispersion, he began his evangelistic work. He headed towards Samaria and preached and baptized among the Samaritans: we are told that when the Samaritans believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the Lord Jesus, they were baptized, both men and women. He also converted the Ethiopian eunuch; and then, journeying from Azotus, he "preached *in all the cities* until he came to Caesarea," where he later resided. The next mention of him is found in Acts 21:8. "We," says Luke, who were with Paul, traveled and entered the house of Philip the Evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him. He had four virgin daughters who prophesied." It is evident, then, that he earned the title *Evangelist* because of his itinerant gospel work and the conversion of individuals. His possession of the gift of the Holy Spirit was as characteristic of him as an evangelist as it was when he served as a deacon in the Jerusalem church; for during his diaconate, he seems to have been just as filled with the Holy Spirit as he was while visiting all the cities from Azotus to Caesarea.

Gathering converts into societies and organizing them into worshiping assemblies are intrinsically linked to the responsibility of converting them. Casual mentions in his letters to Timothy show Paul seeming to define the work of an Evangelist. He states, "Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching; endure hardship; *do the work of an Evangelist;* fulfill your ministry." "Let no one despise your youth. Until I come, focus on reading, exhortation, and teaching. Do not neglect the gift that is in you according to the prophecy — by the laying on of hands of the presbytery or eldership." "Meditate on these things; devote yourself completely to them, so that your progress may be evident to all: take heed to yourself and to your teaching; continue in them: for in doing this, you will both save yourself and those who hear you." This seems to describe the office of an Evangelist that the Lord granted to the church after His ascension.

Setting things in order in the churches — committing the same office to faithful men who will be able to instruct others — ordaining elders, and general oversight of church affairs seem to have been entrusted to Timothy and Titus as agents of the Apostles. How necessary these tasks remain today, and how far their oversight can safely be managed by selected Evangelists regarding *infant communities,* remains a matter of considerable debate. However, it is unquestionable that Evangelists must gather their own converts into communities, teach them, and supervise them until they can care for themselves; this is as integral to the office of an Evangelist as praying, preaching, or baptizing.

But we may be asked, 'Isn't preaching, baptizing, and even teaching the common privilege of all disciples when they have the opportunity?' We also respond by asking, 'Isn't it the privilege of all parents to teach their own children and to preside over their own families?' However, who would infer that all parents are teachers and leaders, does not offend common sense more than one who infers that all disciples, as such, are evangelists, pastors, and teachers simply because we acknowledge that under certain circumstances, all members of Christ's kingdom have the privilege to preach, baptize, and teach. Every citizen of Christ's kingdom possesses, by virtue of their citizenship, equal rights, privileges, and immunities. The same holds true for every citizen of the United States. Yet not all citizens are legislators, magistrates, judges, governors, etc. Before any community, civil or religious, is organized, every individual has the equal right to do what they see fit. But once organized, and individuals occupy appointed offices, whatever rights, duties, and privileges are assigned to particular individuals cannot rightfully belong to those who have delegated them; just as an individual cannot both give and keep the same thing.

Furthermore, there are some duties and privileges that cannot be wholly delegated to others. Parents cannot completely transfer the education of their children, nor can an employer delegate all their responsibilities to a steward or overseer. Likewise, citizens of Christ's kingdom cannot entirely transfer their duties to preach and teach Christ. Enlightening the ignorant, persuading the unbelieving, and exhorting the disobedient when we encounter them and are able or have the opportunity, are inalienable duties. Even the church of Rome, with all its clerical pride, permits and authorizes *lay baptism* when a priest is not available. A Christian, by profession, is a preacher of truth and righteousness, through both example and teaching. *They have the right to preach, baptize, and administer the supper, as well as pray for all individuals when circumstances necessitate it.* However, this concession does not diminish the necessity of having evangelists, bishops, and deacons; nor does it authorize any individual to take on the responsibilities that have been assigned to them. True liberty without licentiousness, and governance without tyranny, encapsulates the true spirit of the Christian institution.

While the Christian system allows every individual "as they have received a gift to minister as a good steward of the manifold grace of God," it also makes provisions for choosing and appointing qualified individuals for all its particular services, necessary for its own edification and comfort, as well as its usefulness in the world. It secures its own continuity and growth in the wisest and most practical way. Its entire wisdom consists of four points: — 1st. It establishes the necessary offices for its perpetuity and growth. 2nd. It selects the most qualified individuals for those offices. 3rd. It consecrates or sets apart those individuals for those offices. 4th. It commands them to dedicate themselves fully to the work, so that their development keeps pace with the growth of the body and is evident to all. Can anyone identify a flaw in this plan? — !

All its officers, whether for its services at home or abroad, when fully qualified, are to be formally and solemnly set apart by the imposition of the hands of the presbytery or eldership of the church. The whole community chooses — the seniors ordain. *This is the apostolic tradition.* Let those unfamiliar with the scriptures examine the apostolic law and practices; see Acts 6:2-6. Thus, the Christian system in its elections and ordinations began. *It is unchangeable.* Consequently, this system applies in all instances. The qualifications for any office are always based on the nature of the office. They are usually detailed, but not always, since the *work to be done* is the best guide in determining the qualifications of the one performing it.

We affirm that the seniors of elders always ordain. Catholicism asserts, 'Only those on whom the apostolic hands have been laid can rightfully ordain.' *Such an idea is not consistent with the Christian system.* The seniors always lay on hands, regardless of whether hands have been laid on them. This is true Protestantism. Better yet, it is true Biblical doctrine. *Nay, it is the Christian System.* The Apostles laid on hands as *seniors,* not because they were *apostles.* This is the crux of a controversy that has persisted for fifteen hundred years. It has been widely misrepresented and overlooked. Protestants are as much aligned with Papism in this regard as Papists are with Protestantism in rejecting Protestant beliefs. It is assumed by Romanists and conceded by Protestants that "*holy hands*" imply official hands by a *jure Divino.* They may be at times, but not always. However, *Christian elders,* (for I do not mean merely old men,) who have long followed the ways of the Lord, possess holy hands, and far more authority with and from the Lord than has ever resided in any pontiff or self-proclaimed vicar of Christ in twelve hundred and sixty years.

To prove that seniors lay hands, we refer to Acts 6:1-15, where the Apostles were the oldest converts in Jerusalem. We also refer to the fact that the presbytery or eldership laid hands on Timothy and conferred upon him the gift or office of an evangelist. Are there then two rules of ordination in one system? Paul and Barnabas, although *Apostles,* were themselves ordained by the church of Antioch through its presbytery. Consequently, *seniors in Christ, as such,* can rightfully lay hands on any individual for any office to which the church has elected them. This must also be accompanied by prayer and fasting. See Acts 6:6; Acts 13:3; Acts 14:23.

Individuals may be younger in years but seniors in Christ. Paul advises Timothy, "*Do not lay hands suddenly on any man.*" This suggests that those being ordained were juniors in Christ; and until they had achieved some character and status as seniors, (even Timothy himself,) they were not to be ordained. It may be necessary to clarify that classic presbytery and the presbytery of a single church are very different institutions. The Apostles ordained *elders* (a presbytery) in every church. They did not make young men old but set apart those who were seniors in the Lord for the office of overseers. They did not elevate juniors to the rank of *seniors,* but they made elders into *bishops.*

The community, the church, the multitude of the faithful, are the source of official power. This authority flows from the body itself — not from its servants. Servants made by servants are merely servants of servants; and such are all the clergy of the Man of Sin. But the body of Christ, under Him as its head, animated and guided by his Spirit, is the source and spring of all official power and privilege. How much more certain and pure is ecclesiastical authority derived from Christ the head, directly through His body, than that which is sourced through a long, dubious, corrupt lineage of bishops or pontiffs! The church is the mother of all the sons and priests of God; and seeking authority from her servants or creations, as do all forms of Papists, whether Catholic or Protestant, is to honor and serve the creature more than the Creator — a form of idolatry deserving only of the darkest nights of the darkest days of the dark ages.

However, the church requires messengers for special occasions — not only its regular deacons and ministers, but also extraordinary ministers. These individuals are chosen by the church or churches in a given district and *commissioned by their letters.* They are not consecrated by the laying on of hands, but *approved by letters* from the community. If we are asked for authority, we present it gladly. 1 Cor. 16:3 is particularly relevant: "And," says Paul to the saints in Corinth, "when I come, *whomsoever you shall approve by letters,* them will I send to bring your donations to Jerusalem." This is the apostolic practice in these cases. In the second epistle, Paul states, "We have sent Titus, the brother (we believe is Luke), whose praise is in the gospel (which he wrote), throughout all the churches — who was also *chosen by the churches* to travel with us for this bounty," etc.

The Christian system necessitates bishops, deacons, and evangelists for its continuity and prosperity at home and abroad. Its bishops teach, preside over, and execute the laws of Christ in all its meetings. The deacons, a broad and diverse group of functionaries made up of stewards, treasurers, almoners, door-keepers, etc., depending on the situation, continually assist in various services. Its evangelists, possessing the proper qualifications, ordained and consecrated to the work of the Lord in converting sinners and establishing churches, by a presbytery or board of seniors competent to carry out the duty, are constantly engaged in growing its membership. These ministers of the word are instructed to be fully devoted to this task, and thus are entirely supported by their peers in it. They are held accountable to all the holy brethren, and to the Lord at His appearing and His kingdom, for the faithful execution of that sacred trust placed in them.

What an efficient institution is that over which Christ presides when it is properly understood and thoroughly implemented in all its aspects! With bishops and deacons at home, and evangelists abroad, fully dedicated to diligently fulfilling their respective duties; men of experience, faith, piety, and morality, filled with zeal, energy, and kindness, collaborating with all similar institutions, sustained by the prayers and voluntary contributions of the united people, with the love of God in their hearts and heaven in their sights, what can they not achieve in glorifying God, benefiting humanity, and honoring themselves! Of such a devoted faith community, fully operational and in concert, it might indeed be asked, "Who is this that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners!"

# 10. Sacrifice for Sin

The history of sacrifice is the history of atonement, reconciliation, redemption, and remission of sins. These are not, at least in the Jewish and Christian traditions, exactly synonymous terms. Sacrifice atones and reconciles. It propitiates God and reconciles man. It is the cause, and these are its effects on heaven and earth, on God and man.

For clarity's sake, four questions should be posed and addressed at the very outset of our inquiries. 1. What *is* sacrifice? 2. *To whom* is it to be offered? 3. *For whom* is it to be offered? 4. *By whom* is it to be offered? The answers are as quick and concise as the questions. 1. In its most literal sense, it is "*the solemn and religious infliction of death upon an innocent and unoffending victim, usually by shedding its blood.*" Figuratively, it means the offering of anything, living or dead, person or animal, or property, to God. 2. Religious sacrifice is to be offered to God alone. 3. It is to be offered for humanity. 4. It is to be offered by a priest.

The majority of sacrifices were lambs. Hence Christ is called the **Lamb of God**, not because of His innocence or patience, but because "He takes away," or bears "the sin of the world." It is rather, then, with reference to His *death* than to His *life,* that He is called the *Lamb* of God. Neither His *example* nor His *doctrine* could expiate sin. This required the shedding of blood: for without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin.

Priests are mediators in their proper place and meaning. But at first, every man was his own priest. For as it was once permissible for a man to marry his sister because he could find no other person for a wife, it was also lawful and expedient for every man to be his own priest. Thus, Adam, Abel, Noah, etc. were their own priests. In the subsequent times, the eldest sons — then the princes of tribes — served as priests for their respective tribes and people. Finally, God called and appointed individuals like Melchizedek and Aaron to those offices.

Sacrifice is undoubtedly as old as the Fall. Its institution is not recorded by Moses. However, he informs us that God had respect for Abel's offering and accepted from him a *slain lamb.* If it had been a human institution, this could not have been the case, for a divine warrant has always been essential to any acceptable worship. The question, "Who has required this at your hands?" must always be answered by a "*Thus saith the Lord,*" before any offering from mortal man can be acknowledged by the Lawgiver of the universe. "In vain," said the Great Teacher, "do you worship God, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men." God accepted the sacrifices of Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, etc., and in the Jewish system, established many laws and regulations concerning it.

Now, as sacrifice can be contemplated in different aspects, in reference to what it is in itself, to whom it is offered, for whom it is offered, and by whom it is offered, in each of these relations, it can be represented under different names. Hence, it is a "*sin offering,*" a *thank offering*, a *propitiation,* [1] a *reconciliation*, a *redemption*. In reference to God, it is a propitiation; in reference to mankind, it is a reconciliation; and from another perspective, it may even be regarded as a redemption or ransom. It may be beneficial to make a few remarks on each of these.

Sacrifice, in relation to *God*, is a *propitiation*; in relation to *sinners*, it is a *reconciliation*; in relation to *sin*, it is an *expiation*; and in relation to the *saved*, it is a *redemption*. These are aspects of cardinal value for understanding the Scriptures. As a *propitiation* or atonement [2], it is offered to God; not to move His benevolence or to excite His mercy, but to render Him propitious *according to law and justice.* It sprang from everlasting love and is the *effect* and not the *cause* of God's benevolence to sinners. Without it, God could not be propitious to us. The indignity offered to His person, authority, and governance by the rebellion of man, as well as the good of all His creatures, made it impossible for Him, according to justice, eternal right, and His own benevolence, to show mercy without sacrifice. Indeed, He always prefers mercy to sacrifice, just as He prefers the end to the means. But divine mercy forever sits upon the propitiatory; upon law and justice. Thus Paul affirms of Jesus, "Whom God has set forth as a *propitiatory* through faith in His blood, for a declaration of His justice — that *He might be just,* and *the justifier of the ungodly,* or of him that believes in Jesus." In this sense only, God could not be gracious to man in forgiving him without a propitiation or something that could justify him both to Himself and all creatures. In this sense of the term *atonement*, it is frequently found in the law, not less than twenty-five times in the single book of Leviticus.

Regarding the sinner, we have established that it is a *reconciliation*. Indeed, the term reconciliation very aptly applies to sacrifice, as it brings the offended and the offender together. Inasmuch as it honors law and justice, it reconciles God to forgive; and as it displays love and mercy to the offender, it reconciles him to his offended Sovereign. It is, from this perspective, truly a reconciliation. It propitiates God and reconciles man. God's "anger is turned away;" (not a turbulent passion, not an implacable wrath); but "*that moral sentiment and justice,*" which demands the punishment of the violated law, is pacified or well-pleased; and man's hatred and animosity against God are subdued, overcome, and destroyed by the same sacrifice. Thus, it is, in reference to both parties, a reconciliation. However, when we speak according to scriptural usage and with proper discrimination, sacrifice, concerning God, is atonement or propitiation, while, concerning man, it is reconciliation. These are its reasons and its effects. "For this cause," says Paul, "Jesus is the mediator of a new covenant, that *by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions* under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance." [3] Again, the same writer makes the death of Christ the basis of reconciliation, saying, "Be reconciled to God: for He has made Christ a sin offering for us;" and now "God is in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself." [4]

As for sin, it has been observed that sacrifice is an *expiation*. The terms purification or cleansing are preferred in common versions over *expiation*. At least once (Num 35:33), we find the need for a better word to represent the original than the term *cleansing*. "There can be no expiation for the land" polluted with blood, "but by the blood of him that shed it." Still, if anyone prefers *purification* to expiation, or even *cleansing* to either, so long as we understand each other, it is indeed a matter of easy forbearance. The main point is that sacrifice cancels sin, atones for sin, and removes it. "*He put away sin,*" says Paul, "*by the sacrifice of Himself.*" This is expiation.

"The redemption, then, which is in Christ Jesus," is a *moral*, not a *commercial* consideration. If sin were only a *debt*, and not a *crime*, it might be forgiven without atonement. Nay, if sin were a debt, and sacrifice a payment of that debt, then there could be no forgiveness at all with God! For if the Redeemer or Ransomer of man has paid the debt, justice, not mercy or forgiveness, commands the *release*, not the *pardon* of the debtor. Some, however, who misunderstand the sacred style and the meaning of biblical terms, have actually represented the death of Christ more as the payment of an immense debt than as an expiation of sin or a purification from guilt, and have thus rendered the pardon of sin wholly unintelligible, or rather impossible. Everyone understands that when a third person assumes a debt and pays it, the principal must be discharged and cannot be forgiven. But when sin is viewed as a crime and atonement is offered by a third person, it then becomes a question of grace whether the pardon or acquittal shall be granted by the one against whom the crime has been committed; because, even after atonement or propitiation is made, the transgressor still deserves punishment as before. There is room, then, for both justice and mercy; for the display of indignation against sin and the forgiveness of the sinner, in appropriate views of sin and of the redemption found in and through the Lord Jesus Christ.

Redemption, however, is the *deliverance from sin*, rather than the expiation or atonement for it. Thus, Christ is said "by His own blood, to have obtained an eternal redemption for us." [5] Thus pardon, sanctification, and even the resurrection of the bodies of the saints are individually contemplated as parts of our redemption, or deliverance from guilt to sin, from the power of sin, and from the punishment of sin. [6]

There are many incongruities and inaccuracies in the debate about the nature and extent of atonement, which, as the mists of the morning retreat from the hills before the rising sun, disappear from our mental horizon when the light of scriptural definition breaks into our hearts. The atonement or propitiation has no "*extent,*" because God alone is its object. It contemplates sin as a unit in the divine governance, and therefore the "*Lamb of God* takes away the sin of the world," and His death is a "*sin offering.*" As to its value, it is beyond expression. Indeed, it corresponds to the sin of the world; for it makes it just on God's part to forgive and save everyone that believes in Jesus. Reconciliation and redemption, however, have a certain limited extent. Reconciliation is not universal, but partial. Not all believe in Jesus, and therefore not all are reconciled to God through Him. Redemption, or deliverance from the guilt, pollution, power, and punishment of sin, is only comparable with and limited to the elect of God, i.e., those who believe in Jesus and obey Him.

Those who affirm that one drop of Christ's blood could expiate the sin of the whole world inadvertently teach that Christ has died in vain; for surely, the Messiah could have shed many drops of blood and still have lived. They make His death an unmeaning superfluity or redundancy. They also inadvertently agree with those who view sin merely as a debt, and not as a crime, and thereby claim that there is no need for sin offerings, or sacrifice, or of a divine Savior for forgiveness.

They too seem to have this misunderstanding, and I regret to find such names among them as Butler, Whitby, and Macknight, who, while contending that the death of Christ was a sacrifice or a propitiation for sin, entirely attribute its efficacy to God's mere appointment. According to them, God could have saved the entire world without the appearance of His Son; for the merits or efficacy of Christ's death arise not from His dignity of person but from God's mere appointment or will! We cannot believe that it was possible for God to save sinners in any other way than He has chosen; for to have paid an excessive price for our redemption suggests prodigality rather than divine wisdom and prudence. And if mere appointment was sufficient, then why not have continued the legal sacrifices, making the blood of bulls and goats sufficient to take sin away?!

To conclude, sacrifice is essential for the remission of sins and is therefore as old as the fall of man. However, the sacrifices of the patriarchal and Jewish dispensations could not and did not take away sin. They were merely types of the real sacrifice; for as Paul says, "It was not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sin." And again, "If the blood of bulls and goats, with the ashes of a heifer, can cleanse for the purification of the flesh, how much more shall *the blood of Christ,* who through an eternal spirit offers Himself to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" Christ's death is, therefore, a real and sufficient sacrifice for sin, and stands in the roles of *propitiation, reconciliation, expiation,* and *redemption*; from which flow to us justification, sanctification, adoption, and eternal life.

The sacrifice of Christ, as previously stated, is, in relation to God, a propitiation; in relation to man, a reconciliation; in relation to sin, an expiation; in relation to the penitent, a redemption; but the attributes that apply to it in any of these aspects do not apply in the others; and this oversight has been, in our opinion, the fruitful source of endless controversies surrounding the term "atonement," as it is most commonly referred to. It is indeed *infinite* in value concerning the expiation of sin or its propitiatory power; but as to the actual reconciliation and redemption of sinners, it is limited to those only who believe in and obey the Savior. While it is as universal as the sin of the world, the particular sins of the obedient are the only ones expiated by it. Its *design*, then, is necessarily limited to all who come to God through it; while its value and efficacy are equal to the salvation of the whole world, provided they choose to place themselves under the covering of its propitiatory power.

The "doctrine of the cross," being the great central doctrine of the Bible and the very essence of Christianity — which explains all the peculiarities of the Christian system and of the relation of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as far as mortals can comprehend them — has been, to skeptics and to many professors, "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense." For the sake of some speculative and critical individuals who ask *why these things are so,* I append an extract from the writings of Mr. Watson on this point, which may offer some useful reflections on this cardinal and all-encompassing subject: — "How sin may be forgiven,” says Mr. Watson, “without leading to such misconceptions of the divine character as would encourage disobedience and thereby weaken the influence of the divine governance, must be considered a problem of very difficult solution. A government that admitted no forgiveness would sink the guilty in despair; a government that never punishes offense is a contradiction — it cannot exist. Not punishing the guilty dissolves authority; punishing without mercy destroys it, and where all are guilty, creates universal destruction. That we cannot sin without consequences is a settled matter. The Ruler of the world is not indifferent to the conduct of His creatures; for that penal consequences are attached to the offense is not subject to debate, but is a fact, evident by daily observation of the events and circumstances of present life. It is a principle already established that God's authority must be preserved; but it should be noted that in that kind of administration, which restrains evil by penalty and encourages obedience by favor and hope, we and all moral creatures are the interested parties, and not the Divine Governor Himself, whom, because of His independent and all-sufficient nature, our transgressions cannot harm. The reasons compelling Him to maintain His authority do not end in Himself. If He treats offenders harshly, it is for our benefit and the moral order of the universe, to which sin, if encouraged by negligence or frequent impunity, would become the source of endless disorder and misery; and if the granting of pardon for the offense is closely and even severely monitored, so that no satisfaction less than the death of God's own Son could be accepted, we should refer to the moral necessity of the case, as arising from the general welfare of accountable creatures, liable to the deep evil of sin, and not to any reluctance on our Creator's part to forgive; much less to anything vindictive in His nature, charges that have been inconsiderately and unfairly implied in the doctrine of Christ's sacrificial sufferings. If it is true that the release of offending humans from future punishment and their restoration to divine favor should, for the interest of mankind themselves, and for the instruction and caution of other beings, be granted in such a way that no license is given to offense; that God Himself, while manifesting His compassion, should not appear less just or less holy than He truly is; that His authority should be felt as compelling, and disobedience should, as truly, though not unconditionally, subject us to the deserved penalty, as if no hope of forgiveness had been offered — we ask, on what scheme, other than that which is revealed in the New Testament, are those necessary conditions provided for? They are necessary unless we advocate for a license and an impunity that would nullify all good governance in the universe, a point no reasonable person would support; and if so, we must acknowledge that there is strong internal evidence of the truth of the doctrine of Scripture when it asserts that the offer of pardon is contingent only on the securities we have mentioned. If it is claimed that sin may be pardoned at the discretion of the Divine prerogative, the response is that if this prerogative were exercised towards only part of humanity, the passing by of the rest would be hard to reconcile with the Divine character; and if the benefit were extended to all, government would cease to exist. This method of bringing humanity within the exercise of a merciful prerogative does not, therefore, address the obvious difficulty of the case; nor is it improved by restricting the act of grace only to repentant criminals. For if repentance signifies a "renewal in the spirit of the mind," no criminal would of himself thus repent. But if by repentance, we mean merely remorse and fear in the immediate face of danger, what offender, surrounded by the ruins of past enjoyments, realizing the vanity of guilty pleasures now destroyed, and witnessing the approach of delayed punishment, would not repent? Were the principle of granting pardon contingent upon repentance to regulate human governance, every criminal would escape, and judicial systems would become a subject of mockery. Nor is it recognized by the Divine Being in His dealings with men in the present state; though in this world, punishments are not final and absolute. Repentance does not restore health impaired by intemperance; properties lost by extravagance; or character once tarnished by dishonorable conduct. If mere repentance could secure pardon, then all must be pardoned, and government would collapse, just as in the case of forgiveness through mere prerogative; but if a purely arbitrary selection is made, then different and discordant principles of governance are introduced into divine administration, which is a derogatory assumption.

The question abstractly posed, "How may mercy be extended to offending creatures, the subjects of the divine government, without encouraging vice by diminishing the righteous and holy character of God, and the authority of His government, in the maintenance of which the entire universe is vested?" is, therefore, one of the most significant and difficult that can occupy the human mind. None of the theories opposed to Christianity provides a satisfactory resolution of this problem. They either assume principles that destroy moral governance or which, in the circumstances of humanity, cannot be enacted. The only answer is found in the holy Scriptures. They alone show, and indeed profess to show, how God may be "just," and yet the "justifier" of the ungodly. Other systems demonstrate how He may be merciful; but the difficulty does not lie there. The gospel addresses it by declaring "the righteousness of God" while proclaiming His mercy. The voluntary sufferings of the divine Son of God, "for us," "the just for the unjust," magnify the justice of God; they display His hatred for sin; proclaim "the exceeding sinfulness" of transgression, by the deep and painful manner in which they were inflicted upon the Substitute; warn the unrepentant offender of the terror and the certainty of his punishment; and open the gates of salvation to every penitent. It is also part of the same divine plan to engage the influence of the Holy Spirit to awaken penitence in humanity and lead the wanderer back to Him; to renew our fallen nature in righteousness at the moment we are justified through faith, and to place us in situations where we may henceforth "walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit." All the objectives of governance are fulfilled here — no license is granted for offense — the moral law is unrepealed — a day of judgment is still appointed — future and eternal judgments continue to reveal their terrifying consequences — a new and remarkable display of the awesome purity of the divine character is given — yet pardon is offered to all who seek it; and the whole world may be saved.

With such evidence presenting its suitability to humanity's condition and such elevated views of the principles and objectives of moral governance, does the doctrine of atonement reveal itself. Additional important considerations mark the united wisdom and goodness of that method of extending mercy to the guilty, which Christianity teaches us was actually and exclusively adopted. It is indeed rendered "worthy of all acceptation" by its capacity to address the difficulties we have just examined — difficulties that must inevitably leave a gloomy impression upon every offender awakened to a sense of his spiritual danger; however, it must be considered attentively as it not only allays the fears we might have concerning the severity of the Divine Lawgiver but also elevates Him in our esteem as "the righteous Lord, who loves righteousness," who surrendered His beloved Son to suffering and death, that the influence of moral goodness might not diminish in the hearts of His creatures; and as a God of love, providing a view of the tenderness and kindheartedness of His nature, incomparably more impressive and compelling than any abstract description could convey, or than any act of creating or providential power could display, and, therefore, most appropriate to quell the enmity that had unnaturally developed in the hearts of His creatures, and which, when corrupt, they easily transfer from a law that restrains their inclination to the Lawgiver Himself. If it is crucial for us to understand the extent and reality of our danger, the death of Christ displays it, not in description, but through the most striking action; if it is important that we have assurance of the divine placability toward us, it here receives undeniable demonstration; if gratitude serves as the primary motivation for future obedience, making command on one side and active service on the other "not grievous, but joyous," the remembrance of obligations such as those the "love of Christ" has laid upon us is a continuous source of this powerful affection, and will elevate it to higher and more delightful activity forever. Everything that can most powerfully illustrate the united tenderness and awful majesty of God, and the reprehensibility of sin; everything that can win back humanity's heart to its Maker and Lord, and transform future obedience into an act of love and delight, as well as duty; everything that can extinguish humanity's angry and malignant passions toward one another; everything that can inspire mutual benevolence and foster a self-denying charity for the benefit of others; everything that can awaken by hope, or tranquilize by faith can be found in the sacrificial death of Christ, and in the principles and purposes for which it was endured."

<sup>1: The Hebrew term translated in the Greek Old Testament, of the *ilasmsos*, and in the common English version, *atonement* or propitiation, is *copher*, which signifies a *covering*. The verb **COPHER** "to *cover,*" or "to *make atonement*" denotes the object of sacrifice; and hence, Jesus is called the *ilasmos*, the covering, propitiation or atonement for our sins. 1 Jn 2:2; 1 Jn 4:10. It is a curious and remarkable fact that God covered Adam and Eve with the skins of the first victims of death, instead of their *fig leaf* robes. This may have prefigured the fact that, while sin was atoned or expiated as it relates to God by the life of the victim, the effect concerning man was a covering for his nakedness and shame, which divested him of his primitive innocence and beauty, and covered him with ignominy and reproach.</sup>

<sup>2: *Kattallagee*, translated once *atonement*; Rom. 5:11, occurs in the New Testament *four times*. In Rom. 5:11, it should have been *reconciliation*, as in Rom. 11:15, 2 Co 5:18-19. It is not *ilasmos, atonement*, in the Jewish sense, but *katallagee, reconciliation*. God receives the atonement, and men receive the reconciliation. It is therefore preposterous to talk about the extent of the atonement, but not so about reconciliation.</sup>

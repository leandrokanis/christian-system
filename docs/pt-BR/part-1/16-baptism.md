# 16. Baptism

There are three things to consider in baptism: — 1. The action commanded to be done; — 2. The subject specified; — 3. The meaning or purpose of that action. Jesus commanded a specific *character* to be the subject of a certain *action* for a specific purpose or *design.* The questions, then, are: What is that action? What is that subject? What is that purpose?

## Of The Action of Baptism

The action is indicated by a word as definite, clear, and unequivocal as any word in any language ever spoken by the many-tongued descendants of Adam. Moreover, in all laws and institutions, and especially those that are of a *positive*, rather than a *moral* nature, all words having both a literal and a figurative meaning, a common and a special significance, should be understood in their literal and common sense, and not in their figurative and uncommon meaning. This has been the consensus of judges of law and language throughout history.

That definite and unambiguous word, as almost universally known in these days of controversy, is *baptisma*, or *baptismos*, anglicized, not translated, as *baptism.* The primary means by which the meaning of this word is determined are the following: 1. Ancient lexicons and dictionaries; — 2. Ancient and modern translations of the New Testament; — 3. The ancient customs of the church; — 4. The places and circumstances of baptizing as mentioned in the New Testament; — and 5. The allusions to this ordinance and its explanations in the apostolic epistles. To each of these, we will do little more than simply refer on this occasion.

1. **The ancient lexicons unanimously give *immersion* as the natural, common, and primary sense of this word.** There is not known to us a single exception. Nor is there a recognized lexicon, ancient or modern, that ever translates this word by the terms *sprinkling* or *pouring.* And since there are only three *actions* recognized as Christian baptism, and as the original words, both verbs and nouns, are translated as *immerse* and *immersion* in all lexicons and never as *sprinkle* or *pour,* does it not follow that neither sprinkling nor pouring is considered Christian baptism? The question is not whether these words are ever, like other words, used figuratively: whether they may not *metonymically* mean *wetting* or *washing*; for these may be the effects of either sprinkling, pouring, or dipping. The question is not whether these words may be so used; but whether the action commanded in *baptizo* is sprinkling, pouring, or immersing a person. All authorized Greek dictionaries, ancient and modern, unanimously affirm that the action is immersion, and not sprinkling or pouring.
2. **All Latin, English, German, and French versions that we have seen, and we believe based on the testimony of others, all that we have not seen, sometimes translate these words, their derivatives, or compounds, by words equivalent to *immersion*: but on *no occasion* do they ever translate them by sprinkling or pouring, or any other word equivalent to those terms.** This is strong evidence: if these versions have been made nineteen times out of twenty by those who practice sprinkling or pouring in the name of the Lord; and if these words occur about one hundred and twenty times in the New Testament, is it not very odd that never once have such translators rendered the words as sprinkling or pouring? This is, in our judgement, decisive proof that such translations were not possible. Indeed, a mere English scholar who has only heard that *baptism* is a Greek word may clearly determine that it means neither sprinkling nor pouring by substituting the definition of the term and testing its meaning in all places where the ordinance is mentioned. This is an infallible rule of interpretation. *The proper definition of a term substituted for it will always make as much sense as the term itself.* Now, if an English reader tries *sprinkling* or *pouring* in those places where he finds the word *baptism,* he will soon discover that neither of these words can possibly represent it, if the above rule is true. For example, we are told that all Judea and Jerusalem went out to John and were *baptized* by him in the Jordan. Sprinkled them *in* the Jordan! Poured them *in* the Jordan! Immersed them in the Jordan. Can there be any doubt which of these truly represents the original in such passages? I may sprinkle or pour water upon a person; but to sprinkle or pour them into water is impossible. It is not said he baptized water upon them, but he baptized them in water, in the river.
3. **The ancient church, it is acknowledged by all, practiced immersion.** This is supported by Roman, Greek, and English historians deemed credible.
4. **The places where baptism was historically administered, such as rivers, pools, baths, and places with abundant water, demonstrate that it was not sprinkling or pouring.** They went down *into* the water and came up *out* of it, etc. And John baptized where there were many waters or a lot of water. Even Paul and Silas went out of the Philippian jail to baptize the jailer at night, rather than send for a cup of water!
5. **It is also referenced and explained through the figure of a burial and resurrection, relating to the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus, etc.** Romans 6 and Colossians 2.

From these topics, many clear and conclusive arguments may be drawn, but it is not our purpose to dwell on them now. If indeed any one of these five points is correct, the action that Christ commands is forever established. How much more compelling is it when they all support the same interpretation! There is, therefore, but one baptism, and not two under the Christian administration.

## The Subject of Baptism

*Characters*, not *persons*, as such, are the subjects of baptism. *Penitent believers* — not infants nor adults, not males nor females, not Jews nor Greeks; but those who profess repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ are the proper subjects of this ordinance. "To as many as received him, he gave the right to become the children of God, to those who believed in his name, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God." "He who believes, and is baptized — not he who is baptized and believes, shall be saved." "Many of the Corinthians who heard believed and were baptized," not many of the Corinthians were baptized and then believed, and finally heard the Gospel! "For without faith it is impossible to please God," etc.

## The Meaning of Baptism

"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins." "And Jesus said that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." Therefore, Peter said to the penitent Pentecostians, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of sins." Again, "As many of you as have been baptized or immersed into Christ have put on Christ; have been immersed into his death;" "have risen with him."

Baptism is, then, designed to introduce its subjects to the participation of the blessings of the death and resurrection of Christ; who "died for our sins," and "rose again for our justification." However, it has no abstract efficacy. Without prior faith in the blood of Christ and deep, sincere repentance before God, neither immersion in water nor any other action can guarantee us the blessings of peace and pardon. It can merit nothing. Still, for the believing penitent, it is the *means* of receiving a formal, distinct, and specific absolution, or release from guilt. Therefore, none but those who have first believed the testimony of God and repented of their sins, and who have been intelligently immersed into his death, have the full and explicit testimony of God assuring them of pardon. To such only as are truly penitent do we dare say, 'Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord;' and to such only can we confidently say, "You are washed, you are justified, you are sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of God." But let the reader carefully review our special essay on the Remission of Sins, in which this much-debated subject is discussed at considerable length.

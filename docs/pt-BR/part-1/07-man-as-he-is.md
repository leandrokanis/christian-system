# 7. Man as He Is

"God made man upright, but they have sought out many inventions." Adam rebelled. The natural man became preternatural. The animal triumphed over the human elements of his nature. Sin was born on earth. The crown fell from his head. The glory of the Lord departed from him. He felt his guilt and trembled; he saw his nakedness and blushed. The bright candle of the Lord became a dimly smoking taper. He was led to judgment. He was tried, condemned to death, stripped of his inheritance, but spared from immediate execution. A prisoner of death, but permitted to roam free until the King authorized his capture and destruction.

The stream of humanity, thus contaminated at its source, cannot in this world ever rise by itself to its primitive purity and excellence. We all inherit a frail constitution—physically, intellectually, but especially morally frail and weak-minded. We have all inherited our father's constitution and fortune; for Adam, we are told, after he fell "*begat a son in his own image,*" and that son was just as flawed as any other son ever born into the world: for he murdered his own dear brother because he was a better man than himself. "Thus, by one man sin entered into the world, and death by that one sin; and so death, the wages of sin, has fallen upon all the offspring of Adam," because in him they have all sinned, or been made mortal—and consequently are born under condemnation to that death which fell upon our common ancestor because of his transgression.

In Adam, all have sinned; therefore "in Adam all die." Your nature, gentle reader—not your person—was in Adam when he reached out his hand to break the command of Jehovah. You did not personally sin in that act; but your nature, through your father, sinned against the Author of your existence. In the just judgment of your heavenly Father, your nature sinned in Adam, and thus it is right that all human beings should be born *mortal*, and that death should dominate the whole race as it has done in countless instances, even "over them that have not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression," i.e., by breaking a positive law. Now it must be acknowledged that what God can righteously and mercifully inflict upon a portion of mankind, he may justly and mercifully inflict upon all; and therefore those who live twenty or eighty years on this earth, because of the sin of their nature in Adam, might just as reasonably have been extinguished in their first year as those who have perished in perfect infancy. Death is explicitly described by an Apostle as "*the wages of sin.*" This consequence of sin is currently inflicted upon at least *one-fourth* of the human race, who have never violated any law or sinned personally by any act of their lives. According to the most accurate mortality statistics, from one-third to one-fourth of all humanity die in infancy, under two years, without knowledge of good or evil. They are thus, though innocent concerning actual and personal transgression, regarded as sinners by him who imposes upon them the specific and appropriate wages of sin. This alarming and profoundly significant fact in human history proves that Adam was not only the common father but the actual representative of all his children.

There is, therefore, a sin of our nature as well as personal transgression. Some inappropriately call the sin of our nature our "original sin," as if the sin of Adam were the personal offense of his children. Indeed, our nature was corrupted by the fall of Adam before it was transmitted to us; hence that hereditary weakness to do good and that tendency to do evil so universally apparent in all human beings. Let no one open their mouth against the transmission of a moral affliction until they satisfactorily explain the fact—that the specific vices of parents appear in their children as clearly as the color of their skin, their hair, or the shape of their faces. A disease in the moral constitution of a person is as clearly transmissible as any physical imperfection, if there is any truth in history, biography, or human observation.

Still, man, with all his hereditary weakness, is not under an unavoidable necessity to sin. Greatly inclined to evil, easily tempted to transgress, he may or may not yield to passion and seduction. This explains the differences we often observe in the corruption and depravity of man. All inherit a *fallen*, consequently a *sinful* nature; though not all are equally depraved. Thus, we find that the degrees of sinfulness and depravity vary greatly among individuals. And although “without the knowledge of God and his revealed will, without the intercession of a mediator, and without faith in him, it is impossible to please God,” still, there are those who, while lacking knowledge and belief, are more noble and virtuous than others. Luke acknowledges this when he states, "The Jews in Berea were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so. Therefore, many of them believed." Acts 17:11. But until man, in his current state, believes the gospel of his sins and submits to Jesus Christ as the only Mediator and Savior of sinners, it is impossible for him to do anything absolutely pleasing or acceptable to God.

Condemned to natural death and greatly fallen and depraved in our entire moral constitution because of Adam's sin; still, due to the intercession of the second Adam, none are punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord except those who actually and voluntarily sin against a dispensation of mercy under which they find themselves: for this is "the condemnation of the world, that light has come into the world, and men *choose darkness* rather than light because their deeds are evil."

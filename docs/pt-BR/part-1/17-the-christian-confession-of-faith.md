# 17. The Christian Confession of Faith

The only apostolic and divine confession of faith that God, the Father of all, has provided for the church — and on which Jesus himself said he would build it — is the sublime and supreme assertion: **That Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, the Son of the living God**. This is the uniqueness of the Christian system: its specific attribute. The pre-flood Abel, Enoch, etc., believed that a Son of Eve would crush Satan's head. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob believed that a special son of theirs would be the child of blessings, the Son of promise to humanity. Indeed, Jesse, David, and all the Prophets looked for one from the royal tribe, who would be king of all the earth and a benefactor to humanity. John the Baptist, in his time, preached and believed that the Messenger of the covenant of eternal peace would soon appear. But the disciples of Jesus, son of Mary, believed and confessed that he was that very person. "We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and all the Prophets wrote; Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of David, the King of Israel." "Rabbi," said Nathaniel, "you are the Son of God, you are the King of Israel." Yet it was Peter who spoke fully and clearly the very assertion that encompasses the whole matter: "We believe and are sure that you are the Messiah, the Son of the living God." "On this rock," he responded, blessing Peter's name and head: "On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it." Concerning this foundation, Paul has said, "no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is already laid, which is Jesus Christ." God himself laid this cornerstone, this tried and precious stone, as the foundation of the temple of grace; and therefore with his own lips called him his beloved Son; and confirmed him by the visible descent and imprint of his Spirit, as his Messiah, the Messenger of Life and Peace to a condemned and rebellious world.

This confession of faith consists of two distinct ideas — one concerning the *person*, the other concerning the *office* of the Son of Man. The first asserts his divine relations, while the second asserts his official rank and glory. No one can intelligently believe this assertion and not turn to God with all their heart: for within it are a thousand thoughts and motives that bind the soul to God and inspire the deepest affection in devotion. It also contains the strongest bond to secure the affections of all Christians to one another. There is no other confession of faith on which the church can be built, one that can possibly remain whole and undivided, except this one. With the heart, a person believes this assertion unto justification; and with the mouth, they make this confession for their salvation. As Paul explains in Romans 10, and thus we have one Lord, one faith, and one baptism, among the unchanging reasons why Christians should maintain unity of spirit in the bonds of peace.[^2]

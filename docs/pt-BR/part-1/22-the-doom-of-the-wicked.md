# 22. The Doom of the Wicked

There are two classes of people in this world. They are often and in various ways distinguished from each other. They are called the righteous and the wicked, the saints and the sinners, the holy and the unholy, the good and the bad, those who fear God, and those who do not. Of one class, many things are said which are not said of the other. It is said of the righteous that they are "in Christ," justified, sanctified, saved, children of God, heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ, a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a peculiar people. Of the wicked, these things are never mentioned in the Bible. They are not in Christ, not justified, not sanctified, not saved; they are children of the devil, "children of wrath," not a chosen race, not a royal priesthood, not a peculiar people.

These individuals have not been reconciled to God through the sacrifice of His Son. They remain enemies of God at heart. For those who loved darkness rather than light, and would not have God's Son as their Savior, He has appointed a day of judgment; a day for the ultimate destruction of ungodly people. Then they shall perish "with an everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power, when He comes to be glorified in all His saints, and to be admired by all the believers." Then the King will say to them on His left, "Depart, you cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels." They are allies of Satan in his rebellion against God, and have devoted their energies and fortunes to his cause; therefore, it is reasonable that they should have their ultimate fate with him.

Of this judgment, Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousand of His saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all that are ungodly of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him." God had, long before the Christian era — from the foundation of the world — "*appointed a day*" in which He will judge **the world** (the entire world) righteously by Jesus Christ, whom He has appointed Judge of all the dead as well as the living.

"It is, indeed, appointed for men once to die, and after this the judgment." The judgment following death is not the general but the individual judgment of persons, as the phrase suggests, whose spirits returning to God are judged and immediately rewarded, as far as in a separate state they can be subjects of reward or punishment. But the "*judgment of the great day*" is for another purpose: not, as some irreverently say, "to bring people out of heaven and hell to judge and send them back again;" but in the presence of a gathered world to vindicate the administration of God's moral government and providence, to reveal the true characters of angels and men, and to pronounce an irrevocable sentence upon all according to their actions. For, as Paul says, "we must all appear before the tribunal of Christ, that each one may receive, *in his body,* the things he has done, whether good or bad." It is, therefore, because of the actual and public declaration and execution of this judgment, that the last day is called "**the day of judgment**," and that the judgment itself is referred to as "**the judgment of the great day**."

The final judgment and "*destruction of ungodly men*" is presented by the Lord Himself, as well as by His Apostles, in the clearest and strongest terms, using the boldest and most shocking imagery that human language and knowledge can offer. Indeed, it is impossible to fully represent this awfully sublime and glorious day to the perceptive powers of mankind. The best efforts have exhausted the faculties of nature in all her usual energies. John, in his grand visions of the last acts of the great drama of human existence, says, "I saw a great white throne, and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is called the Book of Life; and the dead were judged out of the things that were written in those books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged, each one according to his works: and death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whoever was not found written in the **Book of Life** was cast into the lake of fire." Surely "it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."

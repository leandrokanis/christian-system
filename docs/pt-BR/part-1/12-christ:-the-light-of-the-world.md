# 12. Christ: the Light of the World

As Abraham said to Isaac on his way to Mount Moriah, "God," my son, "will provide a lamb for the burnt offering," so it has come to pass. For the redemption of humanity from sin and all its consequences, God has provided a lamb for a sin offering. He sent His Son, who, upon entering the world, said, "You did not desire sacrifice and offering, but a body You have prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sins You have had no pleasure; then I said, 'Lo, I come to do Your will, as it is written of me in the volume of the book.'" But He did more than offer Himself as a sin offering; He was more than the Lamb of God; He was the "prophet of Jehovah," revealing to humanity the character and will of God. He disclosed secrets hidden from the foundation of the world. In one word, He is **the oracle**, as well as the **sacrifice** which God has provided for us.

As the **Incarnate Word**, He is the interpreter of His will. The New Testament, then, is the gift of Christ — written under His guidance and inspiration. All that the Spirit of God has accomplished has been through His instrumentality. The Spirit is Christ's gift. Jesus is now as much the "Lord of the Spirit" as He is the Lord of life and glory. The New Testament is a collection of writings composed by His servants. Six of His Apostles and two of His Evangelists authored it. That book serves as a substitute for the personal presence of the Lord and His Apostles. He bestowed gifts upon humanity after He departed from their presence: "He gave Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers." As part of our salvation — one of the many things God has done for us — we hold the New Testament, the living oracles, or gospel of Christ, in the next order of importance to His sacrifice.

We always look to the sacrifice of Christ as the foundation of our pardon; to His blood that cleanses us from all sin, which grants justification and personal acceptance; and to His Word, which we rely on for guidance and instruction in Christian piety and righteousness. We are as dependent on His *Word* for light as we are on His *blood* for pardon. "I am," He said, "**the light of the world**; he who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the *light of life.*" "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men." "That was the true light," said John, "which, coming into the world, enlightens every person." "As long as I am in the world," says Jesus, "I am the light of the world." Thus Isaiah spoke of Him: "I will also give you as a light to the Gentiles, that you may be My salvation to the ends of the earth." "I will give you for a covenant of the people, or light of the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison; and those who sit in darkness out of the prison house." "His going forth is prepared as the morning." "The sun of righteousness will rise with healing in His wings." "I testify," said Paul, "both to small and great, that the Messiah should bring light to the people and to the Gentiles." The Word of Christ is the light of Christ; therefore, the Christian Scriptures are the light of the world; and whoever follows them will have the light of life. "If you continue in my doctrine," says the Messiah, "you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free." "If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."

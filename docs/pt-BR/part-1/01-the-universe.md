# 1. The Universe

**One** God, one system of nature, one universe. This universe is made up of countless systems, which, in perfect harmony, move forward in alignment with one supreme purpose. That one purpose of all things is the sovereign and infinite pleasure of Him who inhabits eternity and animates the universe with His presence. So worship and adore the heavenly hierarchies, saying: — "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, honor, and power: for You have created all things, and for Your pleasure they are and were created."

The universe is a system of systems, not only concerning the seventy-five million suns and their accompanying planets, which fill the already discovered realms of ethereal space, but also in relation to the various systems that are separate but united; distinct but intertwined; heterogeneous but homogeneous; which are merely component parts of every solar system — of every planet in that system and of every organic and inorganic mass on each planet. Thus, in the person of a single individual man, we have an animal system, an intellectual system, and a moral system, all intertwined and connecting with everything of a similar nature in the entire universe of God: just as we have in the human body itself a system of solids, and a system of fluids; and these again forming themselves into a system of bones, a system of nerves, a system of arteries, a system of veins, etc.

Now, as no one system is isolated and independent, no system can be understood in isolation. Every particular system must be viewed in relation to the system that is closest to it in nature and function. Thus, we view the bones in the human body as connected with the muscles, the muscles as connected with the nerves, the nerves as connected with the arteries, the arteries as connected with the veins — and all of these as connected with the entire human frame, and with the fluids produced by them or circulated through them, etc.

As the systems of the universe and the sciences that study them intertwine and mutually share insights, illustrations, and developments; it is a sign of weakness of mind, rather than strength; of folly, rather than wisdom; for anyone to speak dogmatically with an air of infallibility or to assume the position of perfect understanding on any single subject of human thought, without a deep knowledge of the entire universe. But since such knowledge is beyond the reach of frail mortal man, whose perspective is limited and whose days are but fleeting moments, it is particularly inappropriate for any scholar or believer to claim that this or that conclusion is absolutely irrational, unjust, or inconsistent with the plans of eternal Providence or the purposes of supreme wisdom and benevolence, unless he is guided by the insights of infallible wisdom or the inspirations of the Almighty. Who could judge the wisdom and utility of a single joint without understanding the limb to which it belongs; of that limb, without comprehension of the body it serves; of that body, without a clear awareness of the world in which it exists and the relationships it maintains; of that world, without some knowledge of the solar system of which it is only a small part; of that particular solar system, without a general and even close understanding of all the related systems; of all these related systems, without a thorough grasp of the ultimate design of all creation; of that ultimate design, without complete understanding of that incomprehensible Being by whom, and for whom, all things were created and made? How gracefully does true humility adorn all the reasoning of man. The true philosopher and the true Christian, therefore, always delight in appearing in the genuine attire of humility, honesty, and openness —

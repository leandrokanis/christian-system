# O Universo

One God, one system of nature, one universe. That universe is 
composed of innumerable systems, which, in perfect concert move 
forward in subordination to one supreme end. That one end of all 
things is the sovereign and infinite pleasure of Him who inhabits 
eternity and animates the universe with his presence. So worship 
and adore the heavenly hierarchies, saying:--"Thou art worthy, O 
Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for thou hast created 
all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created."

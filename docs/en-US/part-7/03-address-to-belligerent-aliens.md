# ADDRESS TO BELLIGERENT ALIENS

To him who, through the lens of faith, surveys your camp, there appears not on the whole map of creation such a mixed group, such a diverse and miserable combination of troubled spirits, as are found in actual insurrection and rebellion, in a mad and cursed alliance against the reigning Monarch of creation. In your ranks are found every unclean and hateful spirit on this side of the unfathomable abyss, the dark and lightless receptacle of fallen and ruined intelligences, who, in endless and fruitless wailings, lament their own follies, and through an unending night of despair curse themselves and their accomplices in the perpetuation of their eternal self-destruction. Yes, in your ranks are all who willfully reject the Son of God and will not have him reign over them; whether they are called the decent moralist, the honest deist, skeptic, atheist, infidel, the questioning Sadducee, the boasting Pharisee, the arrogant Jew, the resentful Samaritan, or the idolatrous Gentile. All ranks and degrees of people in political society — the king and the beggar — the wise philosopher and the uneducated fool — the rich and the poor, who disregard the teachings of the Messiah, unite with you in this unholy alliance against the kingdom of heaven. You may boast of many decent fellow-soldiers in the crusade against Immanuel; many who, when weighed in the balances of the political sanctuary, are not found wanting in all the decencies of this present life; but still look at the countless crowds of every kind of wretches, down to the filthiest, most vile matricide, who in your communion are fighting under your banners — stout-hearted rebels! — allied with you in your attempts to dethrone the Lord's Anointed. If you boast of one Marcus Aurelius, you must also associate with many a Nero, Domitian, Caligula, and Heliogabalus. If you take pride in the virtues of one Seneca, you must acknowledge the vices of the ten thousand murderers, robbers, adulterers, drunkards, profane swearers, and lecherous debauchees, who have rejected the counsels of heaven because the precepts of righteousness and life forbade their crimes.

If, then, my friends, (for I now address the most honorable of your community,) you boast that you belong to a very large and respectable congregation; remember, I urge you, that to this same congregation in which you have your brotherhood belongs everything mean, vile, and wretched, in every land where the name of Jesus has been proclaimed. *What a group!* Have you so much of the reflected light of the gospel falling upon your vision as to flush your cheek with the glow of shame when you look along the lines of your alliance, and survey the horrible faces, the ragged, tattered, squalid, and filthy wretches, *your companions in arms — members with you in the congregation of Satan — and confederates against the Prince of Peace!* If you cannot blush at such a spectacle, you are not among those to whom I would offer the pearls of Jesus Christ.

What do you then say? "I am ashamed of such an alliance — of such a brotherhood; and therefore I have joined the Temperance Society — I belong to the Literary Club — and I take my family to church every Sunday." And do you think, O simpleton! that these human inventions, which only divide the kingdom of Satan into classes, and form within it various private communications, honorable and dishonorable associations, learned and unlearned fraternities, moral and immoral gatherings, change the state of a single son of Adam as it relates to the Son of God!! Then may Whig and Tory, Masonic and Antimasonic clubs and conclaves — then may every political cabal, for the sake of elevating some demagogue, change the political relations in the state, and make and unmake American citizens according to fancy, in spite of constitution, law, and established precedents. No, sir; should there be as many parties in the state as there are days in a month, membership in any one of these affects not, in the least, the standing of any man as a citizen in relation to the United States, or to any foreign power. And by the same reasoning, as well as by all that is written in the New Testament, should you join all the benevolent societies on the varied map of Christendom, and fraternize with every brotherhood born *after the will of man,* this would neither change nor destroy your citizenship in the kingdom of Satan — still you would be an alien from the kingdom of the Messiah — a foreigner with respect to all its promised blessings — and, in the unbiased judgment of the universe, you would stand counted among its enemies.

In *character* there are many degrees, as respects any and every attribute that contributes to its formation; but as respects *state,* there are no degrees. In the nature of things, it is impossible. Every man is either married or single, a brother, a master, a citizen, or he is not. Every man is either Christ's or Belial's; there is no middle ground, and therefore no neutral state. Hence the King himself, when on the current battlefield, told his companions to regard every man as his enemy who was not on his side. Among his professed friends, those who deny him in their actions are even counted as enemies.

What a hopeless struggle is that in which you are engaged! Defeat, sooner or later, awaits you. Do you have the counsel and strength to oppose the Sovereign of the Universe? Do you think you can thwart the plans of Infinite Wisdom and overcome Omnipotence? Your master is already a prisoner — your chief is in chains. The fire of eternal vengeance is already kindled for Satan and all his subjects. Mad in his disappointed ambition, and relentless in his hatred of him against whom he rebelled, he only seeks to satisfy his own malice by dragging with him into irremediable ruin the unhappy victims of his seduction. He only seeks to desolate the dominions of God and to ruin forever his fellow creatures. Will you, then, serve your worst enemy and wage war against your best friend?

But your rebellion can achieve nothing against God. His arm is too strong for all creation. You cannot thwart his plans nor stop his almighty hand. The earth on which you stand trembles at his rebuke; the foundations of the hills and mountains are moved and shaken at his presence. You fight against yourselves. God's detestation of your course arises not from any fear that you can harm him; but because you destroy yourselves. Every triumph that your excessive desires and passions gain over the protests of reason and conscience only plunges you into deeper and deeper misery, prepares you for destruction, and makes it essential to the good order and happiness of the universe that you should suffer an 'everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.'

What, then, blinds you, that you should choose death rather than life, and prefer destruction to salvation? "I am not sure that the gospel is true; I love my companions, and cannot see any wrongdoing in satisfying those passions and appetites which my creator has instilled in my nature."

You acknowledge there is a God, your Creator; but you doubt whether the gospel is true! What an abuse of reason and evidence! Can you infer from any premises in your possession that **he**, whose creation man is, who has shown to the eye and ear of man so much wisdom, power, and goodness, in all his grand designs already accomplished, and daily unfolding, in the heavens and on the earth, teaching men to sustain the present life, to anticipate the future, and to prepare for it, has never clearly addressed him on a subject of incomparably more importance — his own ultimate destiny! That God should have gone to so much trouble to elevate man in nature — to provide him with such an organization — to bestow on him reason and speech — perfectly qualifying him to acquire and communicate knowledge on all things necessary to his present animal enjoyments; and, at the same time, to have never communicated to him anything related to his intellectual nature — never to have addressed him on the themes, which, as a rational creature, he must necessarily most desire to know; to have done everything for his body, and for the present — and nothing for his mind, nor for the future — is, to say the least, the most improbable notion that the most romantic imagination can entertain.

That the Creator *could not* enlighten him on these topics is entirely unacceptable. That he could, and *would not,* is directly contrary to every analogy in creation — contradictory to every proof we have of his benevolence, an inexplicable exception to the whole order of his governance: for he has provided objects for every sense — objects for every intellectual power — objects for every affection, honorable passion, appetite, and propensity in our nature; but, on your hypothesis, he has only failed in that which is infinitely more dear to us, more aligned with our whole rational nature, and most essential to our happiness!! It is most contrary to reason.

But the folly of your skepticism is even more glaring when we open the book of the gospel of salvation. In the history of Jesus, you have the fulfillment of a thousand predictions, expressed by numerous prophets for 1500 years before he was born. These recorded prophecies were in the possession of his and our most bitter enemies when he appeared, and are still extant in their hands. How can you dismiss these? All antiquity confirms the existence of Jesus of Nazareth in the times of Augustus and Tiberius Caesar. No contemporary opponent denied his miracles: they explained them away, but did not question the wonderful works he performed. His character was the only perfect and unblemished one the world has ever seen, either in print or in real life; and yet you imagine him to have been the greatest liar and most infamous imposter that ever lived. You must admit him to have been the teacher of everything moral, pure, and godlike — to have lived the most exemplary life — to have devoted his whole life to doing good — while, to support your skepticism, you must imagine him to have been the greatest deceiver and most blasphemous pretender the world has ever known! Truly, you are fond of paradox!
His Apostles, too, for the sake of being seen as the outcasts of the world and the scum of society — for the sake of poverty, ridicule, beatings, imprisonment, and martyrdom, you think traveled across the earth teaching virtue and holiness — condemning every form of vice and immorality, while telling the most outrageous lies, and that too about matters of obvious fact, about which no one with eyes and ears could be mistaken! How great is your gullibility! How weak is your faith!

And to top it all off, you acknowledge that in the most enlightened age, and among the most argumentative and discerning population, both Jewish, Roman, and Greek, in Jerusalem itself, the very site of Christ's crucifixion, and in all Judea and Samaria, and in all the major towns and cities of the entire ancient Roman Empire, Eastern and Western, these unrefined and uncultured Galileans actually succeeded in persuading hundreds of thousands of people, of all ranks, genders, ages, and intellects, to renounce their former beliefs and practices — to face persecution, confiscation of property, exile, and even death in many cases, through faith in their testimony, while everything was fresh, and when uncovering any fiction or fraud was most straightforward!

Now, if it were possible to present your foolishness in an even more inexcusable light, I would ask you to show what there is in the gospel that is not infinitely worthy of God to give and of man to receive? And where under the sky, in any country, language, or era, is there anything that brings greater honor to man, or offers him anything more worthy of his acceptance, than the gospel?

Can there be a more admirable model proposed for how to shape man than the one after which he was originally created? When he was deceived and turned away from God, could there have been a more honorable figure appointed to bring about his reconciliation to God than his only begotten and beloved Son? And could there even be imagined a more delightful destiny assigned to man than an eternity of bliss in the palace of this vast universe, in the presence of his Father and his God forever and ever? Now, with all these points in mind, will you object to this religion because it requires a person to be pure and holy in order to enjoy this eternal salvation? Then cover your face with your hand, and blush, and be ashamed forever!

But you say you love your companions! And who are they? Your fellow rebels, foolish and misguided like yourselves. The drunkard, the thief, the murderer, love their companions, the partners in their crimes. Conspirators and allies in any venture, kindred spirits in guilty and daring enterprises, reinforce each other in their evil schemes, and either from mutual interest or from some hateful affinity in wicked dispositions, band together in groups of malicious wrongdoing. A Catiline, a Jugurtha, a Robespierre had their accomplices. The rakes, the libertines, the freebooters of every kind form their own fraternities and have some sort of affection for their companions. And how does your attachment to your companions differ from theirs? A similarity of disposition, a likeness of likes and dislikes, all stemming from your love of the world and your disdain for the authority of the Messiah. And will not a change of circumstances turn your affections into hatred? Sooner or later, if you do not repent and turn to God, you who are united in the friendships of the world, those friendships arising from the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the pride of life, will not only become enemies but mutual tormentors of one another. Your closest friends in your opposition to the Son of God will become witnesses against you and stoke the flames that will consume you forever and ever. Break off, then, every friendship, alliance, and covenant you have formed with those who scorn the grace of God and condemn the Savior of the world, and form an everlasting covenant with the people of God, which shall never be forgotten. Then, indeed, you may love your companions with all the affection of your hearts and indulge to the fullest every sympathy and social feeling of your nature. Then may you embrace, in all the fervor of brotherly love, those kindred spirits who, with you, have vowed eternal allegiance to the gracious and rightful Sovereign of all the nations of the redeemed, in heaven and on earth. Such companions are worth having, and their friendship is worth cultivating and preserving throughout the journey of life; for it will be renewed beyond the Jordan and flourish with increasing joy through the endless ages of eternity.

But you have said that the satisfaction of all the impulses and desires of your nature must be innocent because they are the creation of God and were instilled in the very fabric of your physical being. If under the guidance of that light and reason, under which God commanded your affections and appetites to operate, your reasoning would be sound and safe; but if they have usurped control over your judgment and captivated your reason, they are not to be indulged. They are like successful rebels who have dethroned their sovereign; and, because by violence and deceit they occupy the throne, they claim a divine right to wield power over their dethroned Prince. Such is the meaning of the argument you present in favor of your rebellious affections. When man rebelled against his Creator, the beasts of the field, until then under his dominion, rebelled against him; and all his passions, affections, and desires partook of the general disorder — of that wild and chaotic anarchy that followed man's disobedience. And have you not in your daily observations — nay, have you not in your own experience, undeniable evidence that the uncontrolled indulgence of even instinctive appetites, as well as the gratification of excessive passions and affections, inevitably leads to the destruction of man's physical constitution? Is not the control of reason, is not the exercise of discretion in the allowance of every animal indulgence, essential to the health and life of man? Then why seek an exemption from the universal law of human existence in favor of that demoralizing course of indulgence, which you would like to call innocent in morals, though in reality it is evidently destructive to physical well-being?

When reconciled to God through the gospel, the peace of God which surpasses understanding reigns in the heart, and all is order and harmony within. Then, under the guidance of enlightened and sanctified reason, all the passions, appetites, and instincts of our nature, like the planets around the sun, move in their respective orbits in the most perfect order, maintaining a perfect balance in all the principles and powers of human action. Pleasures without blemish are then felt and enjoyed from a thousand sources, from which, in the chaos and disorder of rebellion, every transgressor is barred. It is then found that there is not a single superfluous passion, affection, or appetite in man — not one that does not add something to his enjoyment — not one that cannot be made an instrument of righteousness, a means of doing good to others, as well as of enjoying good ourselves. Why not, then, lay down the weapons of your rebellion and be at peace with God, with your fellow beings, and with yourselves?

"Admitting, then, that the gospel is true — that in my current state and standing I am an outsider to the kingdom of heaven, and that I wish to become a citizen, where shall I find this kingdom of heaven, and how shall I be made a citizen of it?" Well, indeed, you may acknowledge the gospel to be true, both because of what it is in itself and the evidence that supports it. Just imagine it to be false — extinguish all the light it sheds on humanity — nullify all its promises — cancel all its hopes — erase from the human heart all the motivations it provides — and what remains to explain the universe, to reveal the moral character of God, to dispel the darkness that surrounds the eternal night of man's destiny, to comfort and uplift him during the relentless struggle of life, to soothe the bed of suffering and death, and to counteract the inner dread and horror of falling into nothingness — of being forever lost in the chaotic wreck of nature — of sinking down into the grave, the food of worms, the prey of eternal death?

It is like annihilating the sun in the sky. An eternal night ensues. There is no beauty, form, nor attractiveness in creation. The universe is in ruins. The world without the Bible is a universe without a sun. The atheist is but an atom of matter in motion, belonging to no system, accountable to none, without a destiny, without a purpose to live or die. He boasts that there is none to punish him: but then there is none to help him — none to reward him. He has no Father, owner, or ruler — no sense of family, no sense of obligation, no gratitude, no comfort in reflection, no joy in anticipation. If he cannot be blamed, he cannot be praised — if he cannot be praised, he cannot be honored — and man without honor is more miserable than the beasts that perish. Unenviable mortal!

What a tragedy is the system of nature, if man does not live again! It is a creation for the sake of destruction. It is an infinite series of designs, ending in nothing. It is a universe of blanks, without a single reward. It cannot be. The Bible is necessary to interpret nature. It is the only commentary on nature — on providence — on man. Man without it, and without the hope of immortality, has nothing to motivate him into action. He is a savage, a Hottentot, a cannibal, a worm. You are compelled, then, to admit that the gospel is true, unless you blindfold reason and refuse to hear the voice of Nature.
But isn't it a joyful necessity that compels your belief in God and in His Son, the renovator of the Universe? It reveals to you all the mysteries of creation, the secrets of the natural world, and leads you to the source of existence and happiness. It inspires you with motives for noble endeavors, encourages you to take courageous action, and points out a prize worthy of your best efforts in body, soul, and spirit. Is it not, then, "a trustworthy saying, and worthy of universal acceptance, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, even the worst?"

But you ask, "Where can the kingdom of heaven be found, and how can you become a citizen of it?" The Prophets and Apostles must guide you in answering these important questions. Moses in the law, all the Prophets, and all the Apostles direct you to the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world — the Apostle of the Almighty Father — the divinely appointed Chief of the kingdom of heaven. He has submitted His claims for your examination — He has invited you to test all His assertions — and to the humble and teachable, He has offered all necessary assistance in evaluating His person and mission.

His character is so familiar, so approachable, so full of grace and goodness, that everyone may come to Him. The lame, the disabled, the deaf, the mute, the blind found in Him a true friend and healer. No one seeks His help in vain. His ears are always open to the stories of suffering. His eyes overflow with compassion for every person in distress. He invites all the miserable and turns away none who seek relief. He rebukes only the proud and graciously receives and blesses the humble. He invites and pleads with the weary, the burdened, the brokenhearted, the oppressed, and all those in need and misfortune, to come to Him, and offers relief to all.

In His official role, He presides over the universe. He is the High Priest of God and the Prophet and Messenger of Peace. He holds the key of David; He opens and closes the Paradise of God. He is the only Sovereign and has the power to grant forgiveness of all sins to all who obey Him.

To accept Him in His personal glory and official dignity and authority, as the Messiah of God, the only begotten of the Father — to know Him in His true and proper character, is the only requirement for the obedience of faith. He who thus acknowledges Him is not far from the kingdom of heaven. To embrace Him as your Prophet, your High Priest, and your King; to submit to Him in these roles, being immersed into His death, will translate you into the kingdom of heaven. Why not, then, gladly and immediately give Him the admiration of your understanding and the devotion of your heart? Why not now enter into the fullness, richness, and excellence of the kingdom? He commands *all* people to repent — He pleads with every sinner whom He addresses in His word, to receive forgiveness and eternal life as a gracious gift.

Can you doubt His power to save, to teach, and to sanctify you for heaven? Can you doubt His compassionate mercy? Will not He who pitied the blind Bartimaeus, who comforted the widow of Nain, who wept with Mary and Martha at Lazarus's grave, who heard the plea of the Syrophoenician woman, who healed the pleading leper, who had compassion on the hungry multitudes, who looked with pity (even in the agony of the cross) upon a repentant thief, have compassion on you and every returning prodigal who seeks mercy at the gate of His kingdom?

Is there anyone in the universe whom you can trust more than the Faithful and True Witness, who, in the presence of Pontius Pilate, made a good confession at the risk of His life? Is there anyone in heaven, on earth, or under the earth more worthy of your trust than the friend of sinners — than He who always, and in every circumstance, testified to the truth? When has He ever broken His word or allowed His promise to fail? Who has ever regretted their trust in Jesus or their reliance on His word? Who has ever been ashamed because of their confidence in Him?

Who can offer such compelling reasons for obedience by His authority as the Savior of the world? Who has such power to bless? He has all authority in heaven and on earth. He has the power to forgive sins, to raise the dead, to grant immortality and eternal life, and to judge the living and the dead. And has He not offered a share in His official authority to everyone who submits to His governance and who, through Him, is reconciled to God? If He has divine wisdom and power, has He not pledged these for the relief, guidance, and benefit of His people? Who can harm them under His protection — condemn those He justifies — accuse those He pardons — or snatch from His hands those who turn to His mercy?

Has there ever been love like His love — compassion like His compassion — or humility like His humility! Who could — who ever did humble Himself like the Son of God? On whose cheek have tears of purer sympathy for human suffering flowed more than those He shed? Whose heart has ever been moved with such compassion as His, which overflowed in tender mercies for the afflicted sons and daughters of humanity? Who ever endured such opposition from sinners for His friends; submitted to such indignities; endured such accumulated sorrows and grief; suffered such agonies of mind and body; as those He faced in giving His life as a sacrifice for His enemies? Forsaken by His God, abandoned by His friends, deserted by every support, surrounded by the fiercest enemies, the most relentless foes, whose hearts were harder than stone, mocking the very pain they inflicted, He died on the cursed tree! The heavens shuddered at the sight — the sun hid its face — the earth trembled — the rocks split — the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom — and graves opened. All of nature stood horrified when Roman soldiers, driven by bloodthirsty priests, nailed Him to the cross — when the chief priests, scribes, and elders in mockery said, "He saved others: can't He save Himself?" The person who does not perceive, who does not feel the power of His love consummated in His death — the tenderness of His pleas and arguments, cannot be reasoned with — cannot be moved by human power. Will you not, then, honor your reason by honoring the Son of God — by surrendering your understanding, your will, your affections, to the teachings of the Good Spirit — to the guidance of His love? Then, and only then, can you feel safe, secure, and happy.

Do you need to be reminded how much you owe to His long-suffering patience already — to His kindness in all the gifts and blessings of His providence granted to you? How many days and nights has He protected, sustained, and helped you? Has He not saved you from countless dangers — from the pestilence that walks in darkness and from destruction that strikes at noon? Who can say but that He has extended your unproductive life to this very moment, so you might now repent of all your sins, turn to God with your whole heart, be baptized for the forgiveness of your past transgressions, be adopted into the family of God, and receive an inheritance among the sanctified? Arise, then, in the strength of Israel's God — accept salvation from His hands — enter into His kingdom, and be forever blessed. You will not, you cannot regret such a step, such a noble surrender of yourself while life lasts; in the hour of death, on the day of judgment, nor throughout the endless ages of eternity. *Today*, then, hear His voice: tomorrow may be forever too late! All things are ready — Come. — Saints on earth, and angels in heaven — apostles, prophets, and martyrs will rejoice over you — and you will rejoice with them forever and ever. Amen!

# Address to the Citizens of the Kingdom

Fellow Citizens,

Your status and standing under the reign of the Prince of Peace have never been surpassed—indeed, have never been matched by any part of the human race. You have visions and revelations of God—his being and perfections—unfoldings of the depths of his wisdom and knowledge, of the plans of his grace, and the purposes of his love, which give you an intellectual and moral superiority above all your predecessors in the Patriarchal and Jewish eras of the world. Secrets of God, which were hidden from ages and generations, have been revealed to you by the Apostles of the Great Apostle and High Priest of your faith. What Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, David, Isaiah, Daniel, and all the Prophets, down to John the Harbinger, rejoiced to anticipate, you have realized and enjoyed. The intellectual pleasures of the highest and most sublime conceptions of God and of Christ granted to you so far surpass the achievements of the ancient people of God, that you are comparatively elevated to heaven, and may enjoy the days of heaven on earth. You have a book which contains not only the charter of your privileges, but which explains a thousand mysteries in the previous administrations of God over all the nations of the earth. In it you have such interpretations of God's past providences in the affairs of individuals, families, and nations, as open to you a thousand sources of rational and emotional enjoyment from incidents and things which puzzled and perplexed the most intelligent and highly favored of past ages. Mountains are, indeed, leveled; valleys are raised; rough places are made plain, and crooked ways straight to your understanding; and, from these facts, you are able to form more accurate conceptions of the present, and more lofty expectations of the future, than fell to the lot of the most highly favored subjects of previous dispensations. And, indeed, so inexhaustible are the deep and rich mines of knowledge and understanding in the Christian revelations, that the most comprehensive mind in the kingdom of heaven might labor in them during the age of a Methuselah, constantly enriching itself with all knowledge and spiritual understanding, and yet leave at last vast regions and areas of thought completely unexplored.

But this clear superiority over the most gifted saints of former ages you unquestionably enjoy. Among all the living excellencies with which they were familiar, they lacked a perfect model of all human excellence. Bright as were the virtues and excellencies of an Abraham, a Joseph, a David, there were dark spots, or at least some flaws in their moral character. They failed to present in living form before their contemporaries, or to leave as a legacy to future generations, every virtue, grace, and excellence that adorn human nature. But you have Jesus, not only as 'the image of the invisible God,' 'an effulgence of his glory, and an exact representation of his character;' but as a man, holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sin, exhibiting in the fullest perfection every excellence which gives charm, dignity, and glory to human character. You have motives to purity and holiness, a stimulus to all that is manly, good, and excellent, from what he said and did, and suffered as the Son of Man, which would have added new charms and beauties to the most exemplary of all the saints of old.

Means and opportunities of the highest intellectual and moral enjoyments are richly given to you, for which they longed in vain: God having provided better things for Christians than for Jews and Patriarchs. Shall we not, then, fellow citizens, appreciate and use, as we ought, to our present purity and happiness, to our eternal honor and glory, the light which the Sun of Righteousness has shed so richly and abundantly on us? Remember that we stand upon Apostles and Prophets, and are sustained by Jesus, the light of the world, and the interpreter and defender of all God's ways to man in creation, providence, and redemption. All suns are stars; and he who is now to us in this life "*the Sun of Righteousness,*" in respect of the future is "*the Bright and Morning Star.*" Until the day of eternity dawns, and the day-star of immortality rises in our hearts, let us always look to Jesus.

But it is not only the happiness of superior heavenly light, though that is most delightful to our rational nature, which distinguishes you the citizens of this kingdom; but that personal, real, and full forgiveness of all sin, which you enjoy through the blood of the Lamb of God, given to you through the ordinances of Christian baptism and confession of sins.

The Jews, indeed, had sacrifices under the law, which could, and did take away ceremonial sins; and which so far absolved from the guilt of breaking that law, as to give them a right to the continued enjoyment of the temporal and political promises of the national covenant; but beyond that Jewish sacrifices and washings could not reach. This benefit every Jew had from them. But as to the conscience, Paul, that great commentator on Jewish sacrifice, assures us they had no power. 'With respect to the conscience,' he says, 'they could not make him who did the service perfect.'

The coming of the law gave the knowledge of sin. It gave names to particular sins, and 'caused the offense to increase.' The sacrifices attached to it related to that institution alone, and not to sin in general, nor to sin in its true and proper nature. The promise made to the patriarchs, and the sacrificial institution added to it, through faith in that promise, led the believers to anticipate a real sin-offering; but it appears the Jewish sacrifices only related to the Jewish institution, and, except for their symbolic character, gave no new light to those under that system on the subject of a true and *proper* forgiveness of sins, through the real and bloody sacrifice of Christ.

The Patriarch and the believing Jew, as to a real forgiveness of sins, stood on the same ground; for, as has been observed, the legal institution, or, as Paul says, 'the coming of the law,' made no change in the understanding of forgiveness, as it related to the conscience. But a new age having come (for 'these ordinances for cleansing the flesh were imposed only until the time of reform',) and Christ having, by a more perfect sacrifice, opened the way into the true holy places, has laid the foundation for perfecting the conscience by a real and full forgiveness of sins, which, by the power of his blood, affects not the flesh, but the conscience of the sinner.

John, indeed, who lived at the dawn of the Reformation, preached reform with a baptism for the forgiveness of sins; saying that 'they should believe in him who was to come after him.' Those who believed John's gospel, and reformed, and were baptized into John's reformation, had forgiveness of sins through faith in the one to come; but you, fellow citizens, even in respect of the experience of forgiveness, are greatly advanced above the disciples of John. You have been baptized, not only by the authority of Jesus, *as Lord of all,* into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, but *into the death* or sacrifice of Christ. This no disciple of Moses or of John knew anything about. This gives you an understanding of sin, and freedom from it, *as it relates to conscience*—a peace and a joy unspeakable and full of glory, to which both the disciples of Moses and of the Harbinger were strangers. So that the light of the risen day of heaven's eternal Sun greatly surpasses not only the glimmerings of the stars in the patriarchal age, and the faint light of the moon in the Jewish age, but even the twilight of the morning.

Your new relationship to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, into which you have been brought by faith in the Messiah and baptism into his death, confirms, in respect of the sense and assurance of forgiveness, all that John and Jesus said concerning the superiority of privilege, granted to the citizens of the kingdom of heaven. You can see your sins washed away in the blood that was shed on Mount Calvary. That which neither the highly favored John, nor any disciple of the Messiah could understand, until Jesus said "*it is finished,*" you not only clearly perceive, but have wholeheartedly embraced. You can feel, and say with full confidence, that 'the blood of Jesus Christ now cleanses you from all sin;' and that by faith you have access to the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling which speaks glad tidings to the heart. You have an Advocate with the Father; and, when conscious of any impurity, coming to him by God, confessing your sins, and asking for pardon through his blood, you have the promise of forgiveness. You now know how God is *just* as well as merciful, in forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin.

But superior light and knowledge, and expanded conceptions of God, with such an assurance of real and personal forgiveness as calms the conscience and brings the peace of God into the heart, are not the only distinguishing blessings which you enjoy in the new relationship with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into which you are brought under the reign of Heaven; but you are formally *adopted* *into the family of God,* and made the sons and daughters of the Almighty Father.

To be called "*the friend of God,*" was the highest title given to Abraham; to be called the friends of Christ, was the special honor of the disciples of Christ, to whom he entrusted the secrets of his kingdom; but to be called 'the children of God through faith in Jesus Christ,' is not only the common honor of all Christians, but the highest honor that could be granted to the inhabitants of this earth. Such honor have you, my fellow citizens, in being related to the only-begotten Son of God: 'For as many as received him he gave the right to become the children of God.' These, indeed, were not descended from families of noble blood, nor genealogies of high renown; neither are they the offspring of the instincts of the flesh, nor made the children of God 'by the will of man,' who sometimes adopts the child of another as his own; but they are 'born of God' through the ordinances of his grace. 'See how great a love the Father has given us, that we should be called the children of God!' 'The world, indeed, does not know us, because it did not know him. Dear friends, now we are the children of God. It does not yet appear what we shall be.'
"Because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father." And if you are sons, it follows that you "are heirs of God through Christ"—the heir of all things. Is this, fellow citizens, a romantic vision, or sober and solemn truth, that you are children of God, possessing the Spirit of Christ, and made heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ of the eternal inheritance? What kind of people, then, ought you to be! How pure, how holy and heavenly in your character; how just and righteous in all your ways; how humble and devoted to the Lord; how joyful and triumphant in your King!

Permit me, then, to ask, In what do you excel?—no, rather, you will ask yourselves this question. You will say, How can we more effectively promote the interest, the honor, and the triumphs of the gospel of the kingdom? Is there anything we can do by our behavior, our morality, our piety, by our influence, by all the earthly means God has given us? Is there anything more we can do to strengthen the army of faith, to invigorate the champions of the kingdom, to make new conquests for our King? Can we not increase the joy of the Lord in converting souls—can we not give occasions of rejoicing to the angels of God—can we not brighten the hearts of thousands who have never tasted the joys of the children of God?

In the current administration of the kingdom of God, during the absence of the King, He has said to the citizens, "Put on the armor of light"—"Contend earnestly for the faith"—"convert the world"—"occupy till I come"—"let your light shine before men, that they, seeing your good works, may glorify your Father in heaven"—"that the Gentiles may, by your good works, which they shall see, glorify God in the day of visitation." He has thus entrusted to the citizens the great work for which He died—the salvation of men. Let us, then, brothers, be found faithful to the Lord and to men, so that He may greet us at His coming with the most welcome praise, "Well done, good and faithful servants; enter into the joy of your Lord!"

Great as the opposition is to truth and salvation, we have no reason to despair. Our friends and allies are greater, and infinitely more powerful than all our enemies. God is on our side—Jesus Christ is our King—the Holy Spirit is at His disposal—angels are His ministering servants—the prayers of all the prophets, apostles, saints, and martyrs are for our success—our brothers are numerous and strong—they have the Sword of the Spirit, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, the breastplate of righteousness, the artillery of truth, the arguments of God, the preparation of the gospel of peace—our Commander and Captain is the most successful General who ever entered the field of war—He never lost a battle—He is wonderful in counsel, excellent in action, valiant in fight—the Lord of *hosts* is His name. He can frustrate the plans of our enemies, control all the powers of nature, and subdue all our foes, earthly and infernal. Under His leadership we are like Mount Zion, which can never be moved. Indeed, under Him we have come to Mount Zion, the stronghold and fortress of the kingdom, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless angels, the general assembly and congregation of the firstborn, registered in heaven—to God the Judge of all—to the spirits of just men made perfect—to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant—and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks such peace, joy, and courage to the heart. Should we not, then, brothers, "be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might?" If in faith, courage, and prayer, we put on the heavenly armor, and march under the King, sounding the gospel trumpet, the walls of Jericho will fall to the ground, and the banners of the Cross will wave over the ruins of Paganism, Atheism, Skepticism, and sectarianism—*Nil desperandum, te duce, Christe.* If a Roman could say, "Nothing is to be feared under the protection of Caesar," may not the Christian say, There is no despair under the guardianship of Messiah the King?

But, fellow citizens, though clothed with the full armor of heaven, and led by the Captain of Salvation, no success in this war is to be expected without constant and unceasing prayer. When the Apostles began to build up this kingdom, despite all the gifts they had, they found it necessary to devote themselves to prayer as well as to the ministry of the word. And when Paul describes all the armor of God, piece by piece, in putting it on he says, "Take the Sword of the Spirit—with all supplication and petition, pray at all times in the Spirit, watching with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints."

This was most impressively and beautifully illustrated in the wars of ancient Israel against their enemies. While Moses lifted up his holy hands to heaven, Israel prevailed; and when he did not, Amalek prevailed. So it is now. When the disciples of Christ, the heaven-born citizens of the kingdom, continue steadfast in prayer and watchfulness, the truth triumphs in their hearts and in the world. When they do not, they become cold, timid, and powerless as Samson shorn, and the enemy gains strength over them. Then the good cause of the Lord languishes.

It is not necessary that we understand how prayer increases our zeal, our wisdom, our strength, our joy, or how it brings success to the cause, any more than we need to understand how our food is converted into flesh, blood, and bones. It is only necessary that we eat; and it is only necessary that we pray as we are taught and commanded. Experience proves that the outward man is renewed day by day by our daily bread, and experience proves that the inward man is renewed day by day by prayer and thanksgiving. The Lord has promised His Holy Spirit to those who ask Him in truth; and is it not necessary for our success? If it is not necessary to give new revelations, it is necessary to keep in mind those already given, and to bring the written word to our remembrance at the right time. Besides, if the Spirit of the Lord was necessary for the success of Gideon and Barak, and Samson and David, and all the great warriors of Israel according to the flesh, who fought the battles of the Lord with the sword, the sling, and the bow; who can say that it is not necessary for those who wield the Sword of the Spirit and fight the good fight of faith? In my judgment it is as necessary now as then—necessary, I mean, for equal success—necessary for those who labor in the word and teaching, and necessary for those who want to conduct themselves like men, in every department in the ranks of the great army of the Lord of hosts.

Though the weapons of our warfare are not physical, but spiritual, they are mighty (only, however, *through God,* to the overthrow of strongholds,) to overthrow all arguments against the truth, and every high thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and to take every thought captive to the obedience of Christ. Let us then, fellow citizens, whether as leaders or as private soldiers, abound in prayer and supplications to God night and day. If sincere, passionate, and unceasing prayers to God for everything He has promised; for all things for which the Apostles prayed were offered to us by all the congregations, and by every disciple in his family and in his closet, for the triumphs of the truth, then we would see the army of the Lord successful in fighting atheism, infidelity, and sectarianism—then we would see disciples growing in knowledge and in favor with God and man. And is not the conversion of the world and our own eternal salvation infinitely worthy of all the effort and enterprise in man, seeing God Himself has done so much in the gift of His Son and Holy Spirit, and left so little for us to do—nothing, indeed, but what is within our power? And shall we withhold that little, especially as He has given us so many and so exceedingly great and precious promises to encourage us to exertion? Has not Jesus said, "The conqueror shall inherit all things"—that He "will not erase his name from the book of life"—that He will confess him before His Father and His holy angels—that He will place him "upon His throne, and give him the crown of life that will never fade away"?

Rise up, then, in the strength of Judah's Lion! Be valiant for the truth! Adorn yourselves with all the graces of the Spirit of God! Put on the armor of light: and, with all the gentleness, meekness, and mildness there is in Christ—with all the courage, patience, zeal, and effort worthy of a cause so beneficial, so pure, so holy, and so divine, determine never to faint nor falter until you enter the pearly gates—never to lay down your arms until, with the triumphant millions, you stand before the throne, and joyfully sing, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and glory, and blessing!"—"To Him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb be blessing, and honor, and glory and strength forever and ever!" Amen.

# Address to the Citizens of the Kingdom

Fellow Citizens,

Your rank and standing under the reign of the Prince of Peace have never been surpassed—indeed, have never been equaled by any part of the human race. You have visions and revelations of God—his being and perfections—insights into the depths of his wisdom and knowledge, the counsels of his grace, and the purposes of his love, which give you an intellectual and moral superiority over all your predecessors in the Patriarchal and Jewish ages of the world. Secrets of God, which were hidden from ages and generations, have been revealed to you by the Apostles of the Great Apostle and High Priest of your faith. What Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, David, Isaiah, Daniel, and all the Prophets, down to John the Baptist, rejoiced to anticipate, you have realized and enjoyed. The intellectual pleasures of the highest and most sublime conceptions of God and of Christ granted to you far exceed the attainments of the ancient people of God, so that you are comparatively exalted to heaven, and may enjoy the days of heaven on earth. You have a book that contains not only the charter of your privileges but also explains a thousand mysteries in the previous administrations of God over all the nations of the earth. In it, you have interpretations of God's past providences in the affairs of individuals, families, and nations, which open to you a thousand sources of rational and emotional enjoyment from incidents and things that puzzled and perplexed the most intelligent and highly favored of past ages. Mountains are indeed leveled; valleys are raised; rough places are made smooth, and crooked paths straight to your understanding; and, from these insights, you are able to form more accurate conceptions of the present and more lofty anticipations of the future than fell to the lot of the most highly favored subjects of previous dispensations. And indeed, so inexhaustible are the deep and rich mines of knowledge and understanding in the Christian revelations that the most comprehensive mind in the kingdom of heaven could labor in them during the age of Methuselah, constantly enriching itself with all knowledge and spiritual understanding, and yet leave vast regions and areas of thought completely unexplored.

But this clear superiority over the most gifted saints of former ages is undoubtedly yours. Among all the living excellencies they were acquainted with, they lacked a perfect model of all human excellence. Bright as were the virtues and excellencies of an Abraham, a Joseph, a David, there were flaws, or at least some blemishes in their moral character. They failed to present in living form before their contemporaries, or to leave as a legacy to posterity, every virtue, grace, and excellence that adorns human nature. But you have Jesus, not only as 'the image of the invisible God,' 'an effulgence of his glory, and an exact representation of his character;' but as a man, holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sin, exhibiting in the fullest perfection every excellence that gives charm, dignity, and glory to human character. You have motives for purity and holiness, a stimulus to all that is noble, good, and excellent, from what he said and did, and suffered as the Son of Man, which would have added new charms and beauties to the most exemplary of all the saints of ancient times.

Means and opportunities for the highest intellectual and moral enjoyment are richly bestowed upon you, for which they longed in vain: God having provided some better things for Christians than for Jews and Patriarchs. Shall we not, then, fellow citizens, appreciate and use, as we ought, for our present purity and happiness, and for our eternal honor and glory, the light that the Sun of Righteousness has shed so richly and abundantly on us? Remember that we stand upon Apostles and Prophets, and are sustained by Jesus, the light of the world, and the interpreter and defender of all God's ways to humanity in creation, providence, and redemption. All suns are stars; and he who is now to us in this life "*the Sun of Righteousness,*" in respect to the future is "*the Bright and Morning Star.*" Until the day of eternity dawns, and the day-star of immortality arises in our hearts, let us always look to Jesus.

But it is not only the joy of superior heavenly light, though that is most delightful to our rational nature, which distinguishes you, the citizens of this kingdom; but that personal, real, and complete remission of all sin, which you enjoy through the blood of the Lamb of God, granted to you through the ordinances of Christian baptism and confession of sins.

The Jews, indeed, had sacrifices under the law, which could and did take away ceremonial sins; and which so far absolved from the guilt of breaking that law, as to give them a right to the continued enjoyment of the temporal and political promises of the national covenant; but further Jewish sacrifices and washings could not reach. This benefit every Jew had from them. But concerning the conscience, Paul, that great commentator on Jewish sacrifice, assures us they had no power. 'With respect to the conscience,' he says, 'they could not make him who performed the service perfect.'

The entrance of the law gave the knowledge of sin. It named particular sins and 'caused the offense to abound.' The sacrifices associated with it were related to that institution alone, and not to sin in general, nor to sin in its true and proper nature. The promise made to the patriarchs, and the sacrificial institution added to it, through faith in that promise, led the believers to anticipate a real sin-offering; but it appears the Jewish sacrifices only pertained to the Jewish institution, and, except for their typical character, provided no new insight to those under that system on the subject of a true and *proper* remission of sins, through the real and bloody sacrifice of Christ.

The Patriarch and the believing Jew, concerning a real remission of sins, stood on the same ground; for, as has been noted, the legal institution, or, as Paul says, 'the introduction of the law,' made no change in the understanding of remission, concerning the conscience. But a new age having come (for 'these ordinances for cleansing the flesh were imposed only until the time of reformation'), and Christ having, by a more perfect sacrifice, opened the way into the true holy places, has laid the foundation for perfecting the conscience by a real and full remission of sins, which, by the virtue of his blood, does not terminate upon the flesh, but upon the conscience of the sinner.

John, indeed, who lived at the dawn of the Reformation, preached reformation with a baptism for the remission of sins; saying that 'they should believe in him who was to come after him.' Those who believed John's gospel, and reformed, and were baptized into John's reformation, had remission of sins through faith in what was to come; but you, fellow citizens, even in respect of the enjoyment of remission, are greatly advanced above the disciples of John. You have been baptized, not only by the authority of Jesus, *as Lord of all,* into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, but *into the death* or sacrifice of Christ. This no disciple of Moses or of John knew anything about. This gives you an insight into sin, and a freedom from it, *as it concerns conscience*—a peace and a joy unutterable and full of glory, to which both the disciples of Moses and of the Baptist were strangers. So that the light of the risen day of heaven's eternal Sun greatly surpasses, not only the glimmers of the stars in the patriarchal age, and the faint light of the moon in the Jewish age, but even the twilight of the morning.

Your new relationship to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, into which you have been introduced by faith in the Messiah and baptism into his death, confirms, in respect of the sense and assurance of remission, all that John and Jesus said concerning the superiority of privilege granted to the citizens of the kingdom of heaven. You can see your sins washed away in the blood that was shed on Mount Calvary. That which neither the highly favored John, nor any disciple of the Messiah could understand, until Jesus said "*it is finished,*" you not only clearly perceive, but have wholeheartedly embraced. You can feel, and say with all assurance, that 'the blood of Jesus Christ now cleanses you from all sin;' and that by faith you have access to the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling which speaks glad tidings to the heart. You have an Advocate with the Father; and, when aware of any impurity, coming to him by God, confessing your sins, and seeking pardon through his blood, you have the promise of remission. You now know how God is *just* as well as merciful, in forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin.

But superior light and knowledge, and expanded conceptions of God, with such assurance of real and personal remission as calms the conscience and introduces the peace of God into the heart, are not the only distinguishing favors which you enjoy in the new relationship with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into which you are introduced under the reign of Heaven; but you are formally *adopted* *into the family of God,* and made the sons and daughters of the Almighty Father.

To be called "*the friend of God,*" was the highest title given to Abraham; to be called the friends of Christ was the unique honor of the disciples of Christ, to whom he confided the secrets of his reign; but to be called 'the children of God through faith in Jesus Christ,' is not only the common honor of all Christians, but the highest honor that could be granted to the inhabitants of this earth. Such honor have you, my fellow citizens, in being related to the only-begotten Son of God: 'For as many as received him he gave the privilege of becoming the sons of God.' These, indeed, were not descended from families of noble blood, nor genealogies of high renown; neither are they the offspring of the instincts of the flesh, nor made the sons of God 'by the will of man,' who sometimes adopts the child of another as his own; but they are 'born of God' through the ordinances of his grace. 'Behold how great love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the children of God!' 'The world, indeed, does not know us, because it did not know him. Beloved, now are we the children of God. It does not yet appear what we shall be.'
'Because you are children of God, God has sent the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.' And if you are children, it follows that you 'are heirs of God through Christ'—the heir of all things. Is this, fellow citizens, a romantic vision, or a sober and solemn truth, that you are children of God, possessing the spirit of Christ, and made heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ of the eternal inheritance! What kind of people, then, ought you to be! How pure, how holy and heavenly in your attitude; how just and righteous in all your ways; how humble and devoted to the Lord; how joyful and triumphant in your King!

Allow me to ask, Where do you excel?—nay, rather, you will ask this question of yourselves. You will say, How can we more successfully promote the interest, the honor, and the triumphs of the gospel of the kingdom? Is there anything we can do by our behavior, our morality, our piety, by our influence, by all the earthly means with which God has equipped us? Is there anything we can do more to strengthen the army of faith, to invigorate the champions of the kingdom, to make new conquests for our King? Can we not increase the joy of the Lord in converting souls—can we not provide occasions for rejoicing to the angels of God—can we not bring joy to the hearts of thousands who have never tasted the joys of being children of God?

In the current administration of the kingdom of God, during the absence of the King, he has said to the citizens, 'Put on the armor of light'—'Contend earnestly for the faith'—'convert the world'—'occupy until I come'—'let your light shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven'—'that the Gentiles may, by your good works, which they will see, glorify God in the day of visitation.' He has thus entrusted to the citizens the great work for which he died—the salvation of humanity. Let us, then, brothers and sisters, be found faithful to the Lord and to others, so that he may address us at his coming with the most acceptable praise, 'Well done, good and faithful servants; enter into the joy of your Lord!'

Great as the opposition is to truth and salvation, we have no reason to despair. Greater are our friends and allies, and infinitely more powerful than all our enemies. God is on our side—Jesus Christ is our King—the Holy Spirit is at his disposal—angels are his ministering servants—the prayers of all the prophets, apostles, saints, and martyrs are for our success—our brethren are numerous and strong—they have the Sword of the Spirit, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, the breastplate of righteousness, the artillery of truth, the arguments of God, the preparation of the gospel of peace—our Commander and Captain is the most successful General that ever entered the field of battle—he never lost a fight—he is wonderful in counsel, excellent in action, valiant in battle—the Lord of *hosts* is his name. He can thwart the plans of our enemies, control all the powers of nature, and subdue all our foes, both earthly and infernal. Under his leadership, we are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved. Indeed, under him we have come to Mount Zion, the stronghold and fortress of the kingdom, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless angels, the general assembly and congregation of the firstborn, enrolled in heaven—to God the Judge of all—to the spirits of just people made perfect—to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant—and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks such peace, joy, and courage to the heart. Should we not, then, brothers and sisters, 'be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might?' If in faith, courage, and prayer, we put on the heavenly armor, and march under the King, sounding the gospel trumpet, the walls of Jericho will fall to the ground, and the banners of the Cross will wave over the ruins of Paganism, Atheism, Skepticism, and sectarianism—*Nil desperandum, te duce, Christe.* If a Roman could say, 'Nothing is to be feared under the auspices of Caesar,' may not the Christian say, There is no despair under the guardianship of Messiah the King?

But, fellow citizens, even though we are clothed with the whole armor of heaven, and led by the Captain of Salvation, we cannot expect success in this war without constant and persistent prayer. When the Apostles began to build up this kingdom, despite all the gifts they enjoyed, they found it necessary to devote themselves to prayer as well as to the ministry of the word. And when Paul describes all the armor of God, piece by piece, in putting it on he says, 'Take the Sword of the Spirit—with all supplication and prayer, pray at all times in the Spirit, watching with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints.'

This was most impressively and beautifully illustrated in the wars of ancient Israel against their enemies. While Moses lifted up his holy hands to heaven, Israel prevailed; and when he did not, Amalek prevailed. So it is now. When the disciples of Christ, the heaven-born citizens of the kingdom, remain steadfast in prayer and watchfulness, the truth triumphs in their hearts and in the world. When they do not, they become cold, timid, and powerless like Samson shorn, and the enemy gains strength over them. Then the good cause of the Lord suffers.

It is not necessary for us to understand how prayer increases our zeal, our wisdom, our strength, our joy, or how it brings success to the cause, any more than we need to understand how our food is converted into flesh, blood, and bones. It is only necessary that we eat; and it is only necessary that we pray as we are taught and commanded. Experience shows that the outward person is renewed day by day by our daily bread, and experience shows that the inward person is renewed day by day through prayer and thanksgiving. The Lord has promised his Holy Spirit to those who ask him in truth; and is it not essential to our success? If it is not necessary to give new revelations, it is necessary to keep in mind those already given, and to bring the written word to our remembrance at the right time. Besides, if the Spirit of the Lord was necessary for the success of Gideon and Barak, and Samson and David, and all the great warriors of Israel according to the flesh, who fought the battles of the Lord with the sword, the sling, and the bow; who can say that it is not necessary for those who draw the Sword of the Spirit and fight the good fight of faith? In my view, it is as necessary now as it was then—necessary, I mean, for equal success—necessary for the success of those who labor in the word and teaching, and necessary for those who would conduct themselves like men in every role in the ranks of the great army of the Lord of hosts.

Though the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but spiritual, they are mighty (only, however, *through God,* to the tearing down of strongholds,) to the tearing down of all arguments against the truth, and every high thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and in leading every thought captive to the obedience of Christ. Let us then, fellow citizens, whether as leaders or as private soldiers, abound in prayer and supplications to God night and day. If sincere, ardent, and persistent prayers to God for everything that he has promised; for all things for which the Apostles prayed were offered by all the congregations, and by every disciple in his family and in his private prayer, for the triumphs of the truth, then we would see the army of the Lord successful in battle against atheism, infidelity, and sectarianism—then we would see disciples growing in knowledge and in favor with God and man. And is not the conversion of the world and our own eternal salvation infinitely worthy of all the effort and enterprise of humanity, seeing God himself has done so much in the gift of his Son and Holy Spirit, and left for us so little to do—nothing, indeed, but what is within our power? And shall we withhold that little, especially as he has given us so many and such exceedingly great and precious promises to motivate us to action? Has not Jesus said, 'The conqueror shall inherit all things'—that he 'will not blot out his name from the book of life'—that he will confess it before his Father and his holy angels—that he will place him 'upon his throne, and give him the crown of life that will never fade away'?

Rise up, then, in the strength of Judah's Lion! Be courageous for the truth! Adorn yourselves with all the graces of the Spirit of God! Put on the armor of light: and, with all the gentleness, meekness, and mildness found in Christ—with all the courage, patience, zeal, and effort worthy of a cause so beneficial, so pure, so holy, and so divine, determine never to faint nor falter until you enter the pearly gates—never to lay down your arms, until, with the triumphant millions, you stand before the throne, and joyfully sing, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and glory, and blessing!"—"To him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb be blessing, and honor, and glory and strength forever and ever!" Amen.

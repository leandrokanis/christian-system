# A WORD TO FRIENDLY ALIENS

Whether to see you as *Proselytes of the Gate*, who refused circumcision but wanted to live in the land of Israel, to be in the suburbs of the cities of Judah, and to keep some of the institutions of the ancient kingdom of God without becoming full citizens of that kingdom; or to view you as the Samaritans of old, who built a temple of God on Mount Gerizim, held onto part of the ancient revelation of God, and rejected only those parts that did not align with their biases — worshipping the God of Israel alongside the idols of the nations from which they came — I say, whether to regard you as one or the other of those ancient practitioners of religion might require more skill in moral reasoning than we possess — more time than we have available — and more effort than either of us has the patience to endure. One thing, however, is clear: if, under the Reign of Heaven, it was necessary for a good man like Cornelius ('a devout man, who feared God with all his household, gave generously to those in need, and prayed to God continually') to '*hear words by which he might be saved,*' and to put on Christ through immersion into his death so that he might enter the kingdom of heaven and enjoy the forgiveness of sins and the hope of an inheritance among all the sanctified — then it is certainly both wise and necessary for you to go and do likewise.

Every sectarian in the land, no matter how honest and pious, should bury their sectarianism and all their other sins of omission and commission in 'the bath of regeneration.' It is a serious offense for anyone claiming to have received the Messiah in his true person, character, and role to refuse allegiance to him in any way; and to replace divine ordinances and statutes with human inventions and traditions. In fact, maintaining any doctrine, practice, or custom that directly or indirectly undermines the constitution, laws, and practices of the kingdom over which Jesus presides is directly opposed to his governance; and would ultimately result in dethroning him in favor of a rival, placing upon his throne the author of that doctrine, practice, or custom that undermines the institution of the Savior of the world.

It is to you, then, who, in the name of the King, are changing his ordinances and substituting your own solutions for the wisdom and authority of the Judge of all, that we now propose the following considerations: —

Every kingdom has one uniform law or institution for naturalizing aliens; and that institution, whatever it may be, is obligatory, by the authority of the government, on everyone who wishes to become a citizen. We assert that it is obligatory for anyone who desires to be a citizen to submit to that institution. But does not your practice and your doctrine explicitly state that it is not the duty of an alien to be born again, but rather the duty of their father or guardian to have them naturalized? Now, while many responsibilities are shared among brothers, fathers, and children, those duties that specifically belong to a father cannot be transferred to his child, whether in religion, morality, or society. If it is the father's duty to 'offer his child to the Lord,' to use your own terminology, it is not the child's duty to offer themselves. It was not Isaac's responsibility to be circumcised, but Abraham's responsibility to circumcise him. If, then, it was your father's duty to have made you citizens of the kingdom of heaven, it is not your duty to become citizens unless you can provide a law stating that in *all cases* where the father fails to fulfill his duty, it shall then be the duty of the child to do what their father neglected.

Furthermore — if all fathers, like yours, had, on their own authority, baptized their children without any command from the Lord, there would not be a single person in a nation to whom it could be said, 'Repent and be baptized;' much less could it be said to every penitent, 'Be baptized, every one of you, by the authority of the Lord, for the forgiveness of sins.' These remarks are intended to demonstrate that your institutions do, in fact, undermine the government of Christ and aim for the complete abolition of the institutions of his kingdom. For this reason alone, if for no other, you ought to be constitutionally naturalized and legally and honorably inducted into the kingdom of heaven. It is a solemn duty you owe to the King and his government; and if your conscience is shaped by the oracles of God, you cannot have confidence in God, nor true peace of mind, as long as you support, endorse, and influence the breakdown of the institutions of Jesus Christ, opening his kingdom to all that is born of the flesh, and preventing, as much as you can, every person from the opportunity to choose whom they will obey — to confess him before others — to take his yoke — to die, be buried, and raised with Christ in his gracious institution. If Jesus himself, in order to fulfill all righteousness or honor every divine institution, though he did not need the reformation for the forgiveness of sins that John preached, was immersed by John — what justification do you have — you who would claim the honors and privileges of the kingdom of heaven, refusing to follow the example of Jesus, and who effectively undermine his authority by supporting a system that would, if fully implemented, not allow a voluntary agent in the human race to do what all the first converts of Christ did, by the authority of the commission that Jesus gave to his Apostles?

Moreover — whatever confidence you may currently have that you are good citizens of the kingdom of the Messiah, that confidence is not based on a "**thus saith the lord**," but on your own reasoning, which all people must acknowledge can be, in this and many other matters, misleading. Jesus has said, 'He who believes and is immersed shall be saved;' and Peter commanded every penitent to be immersed for the forgiveness of their sins. Now, he who hears the word, believes it, and is immersed based on their own confession has an assurance, a confidence, that is impossible for you to possess.

Let me add just one more consideration, for we are not currently debating the merits of your theory or that of any group: it is your duty, as you seek the unity of (what you call) the church and the conversion of the world, to be immersed and to be born constitutionally into the kingdom; because all Protestants, of every denomination, if they are sincere believers in Jesus *as the Christ,* regardless of any opinions found in human creeds, could, if they chose, honor and obey his institutions, come into one fold, and sit together under the reign of the Messiah. If all would follow your example, this would necessarily happen; if they do not, you have fulfilled your duty. In being thus immersed, the entire world, Catholic and Protestant, acknowledges that you are truly and scripturally baptized; for all agree that an *immersed* penitent is constitutionally baptized into Christ; but only a portion of the professing world can accept the rite of infant affusion on which you rely as introducing you, without prior knowledge, faith, or repentance, into the family of God. Therefore, clear your conscience; follow the example of Jesus; honor and support his authority; promote the unity and peace of the family of God; do what you can for the conversion of the world; enter into the full enjoyment of the blessings of the kingdom of heaven by confessing the ancient faith, and by being immersed in the name of Jesus into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, for the forgiveness of sins. Then you may say, as Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, although the Samaritans have a temple on Mount Gerizim, a priesthood, and the five books of Moses, 'Salvation is from the Jews.' Although the sects have the Oracles of God, human creeds, many altars, priests, and religious practices, *the enjoyment of salvation* is among those who simply believe what the Apostles wrote about Jesus, and who from the heart obey that form of doctrine which the Apostles delivered to us.

In doing so, you will also wisely ensure your own safety and security from the significant calamities that are accumulating every day and are soon to fall with overwhelming force on a distracted, divided, alienated, and corrupt generation. If you are '*the people of God,*' as you claim, and as we would like to believe, then you are commanded by a voice from heaven, 'Come out of her, *my people,* so that you do not share in her sins, and so that you do not receive any of her plagues.' If affliction, shame, poverty, and reproach were to be the inescapable fate of the most faithful servants of God, it is infinitely better for you to suffer with them than to enjoy for a time all that a corrupted and fallen society can offer you. Remember who has said, 'Blessed are those who keep his commandments, for they shall have the right to the tree of life, and they shall enter through the gates into the city!'

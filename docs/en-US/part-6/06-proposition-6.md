# Proposition 6

***The breaking of the bread and the drinking of the cup commemorate the Lord's death.***

On the bread and on the cup of the Lord, in letters that speak not to the eye, but to the heart of every disciple, is inscribed, "*When you see this, remember me.*" Indeed, the Lord says to each disciple, when he receives the symbols into his hand, 'This is my body broken for *you*. This is my blood shed for *you*. The bread is thus a representation of his body — first whole, then wounded for our sins. The cup is thus a representation of his blood — once his life, but now poured out to cleanse us from our sins. To every disciple he says, For *you* my body was wounded; for *you* my life was taken. In receiving it, the disciple says, "Lord, I believe it. My life springs from your suffering; my joy from your sorrows; and my hope of everlasting glory from your humiliation and abasement even to death." Each disciple, in handing the symbols to his fellow disciple, says, in effect, "You, my brother, once an outsider, are now a citizen of heaven; once a stranger, are now brought home to the family of God. You have accepted my Lord as your Lord, my people as your people. Under Jesus the Messiah, we are one. Embraced in the everlasting arms, I embrace you in mine: your sorrows shall be my sorrows, and your joys my joys. Joint debtors to the grace of God and the love of Jesus, we shall jointly suffer with him, so that we may jointly reign with him. Let us, then, renew our strength, remember our King, and hold fast our confident hope unshaken to the end."

- Blessed be the tie that binds

  Our hearts in Christian love;

  The fellowship of kindred minds
  Is like that above.


Here he knows no one after the flesh. Ties that spring from eternal love, revealed in blood, and addressed to his senses, draw forth all that is within him of affectionate feeling for those joint heirs with him of the grace of eternal life. While it represents to him '*the bread of life*' — all the salvation of the Lord — it is the strength of his faith, the joy of his hope, and the life of his love.

This institution commemorates the love that reconciled us to God, and always provides us with a new reason to live for him who died for us. For those who do not feel the eloquence and power of this reason, all other arguments are in vain. God's goodness, revealed in creation and in his providence, is well designed to lead people to change. But the heart, on which these fail, and to which Calvary appeals in vain, is past feeling, hardened, and irreclaimable, beyond the reach of any moral power known to humanity.

Every time the disciples gather around the Lord's table, they are given a new argument against sin, as well as a new proof of the love of God. It is intended to crucify the world in our hearts, as well as to awaken us to God, and to spread his love within us. Therefore, it must reasonably be a regular part of Christian worship in all Christian gatherings; which leads us to state, illustrate, and support the following main proposition, to which the preceding six are all preliminary.

# Proposition 6

***The breaking of the loaf and the drinking of the cup commemorate the Lord's death.***

On the loaf and on the cup of the Lord, in letters that speak not to the eye but to the heart of every disciple, is inscribed, "*When you see this, remember me.*" Indeed, the Lord says to each disciple, when he receives the symbols in his hand, 'This is my body broken for *you*. This is my blood shed for *you*.' The loaf is thus made a representation of his body — first whole, then wounded for our sins. The cup is thus established as a representation of his blood — once his life, but now poured out to cleanse us from our sins. To every disciple he says, For *you* my body was wounded; for *you* my life was given. In receiving it the disciple says, "Lord, I believe it. My life springs from your suffering; my joy from your sorrows; and my hope of eternal glory from your humiliation and abasement even to death." Each disciple, in handing the symbols to a fellow disciple, says, in effect, "You, my brother, once a stranger, are now a citizen of heaven; once an outsider, are now brought home to the family of God. You have accepted my Lord as your Lord, my people as your people. Under Jesus the Messiah we are one. Mutually embraced in the everlasting arms, I embrace you in mine: your sorrows shall be my sorrows, and your joys my joys. Joint debtors to the favor of God and the love of Jesus, we shall suffer together with him, that we may reign together with him. Let us, then, renew our strength, remember our King, and hold fast our confident hope unshaken to the end."

- Blest be the tie that binds

  Our hearts in Christian love;

  The fellowship of kindred minds
  Is like to that above.


Here he knows no one according to the flesh. Ties that spring from eternal love, revealed in blood, and addressed to his senses, draw forth all that is within him of affectionate feeling, to those joint heirs with him of the grace of eternal life. While it represents to him '*the bread of life*' — all the salvation of the Lord — it is the strength of his faith, the joy of his hope, and the life of his love.13

This institution commemorates the love that reconciled us to God, and always provides us with a new reason to live for him who died for us. Anyone who does not feel the eloquence and power of this reason will find all other arguments ineffective. God's goodness, revealed in creation and providence, is well designed to lead people to change. But the heart on which these fail, and to which Calvary appeals in vain, is unfeeling, stubborn, and beyond the reach of any moral power known to mortal man.

Every time the disciples gather around the Lord's table, they are given a new argument against sin, as well as a new proof of God's love. It is intended as much to crucify the world in our hearts as to bring us to God and spread his love within us. Therefore, it must reasonably be a regular part of Christian worship in all Christian gatherings; which leads us to state, illustrate, and support the following key proposition, to which the preceding six are all preliminary.

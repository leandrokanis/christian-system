# Proposition 4

***All Christians are members of the family of God, are called and established as a holy and royal priesthood, and may, therefore, bless God for the Lord's table, its bread, and cup — approach it without fear and partake of it with joy as often as they wish, in remembrance of the death of their Lord and Savior.***

We will support the different clauses of this proposition in order — '*all Christians are members of the family of God:*'10

'But Christ is trusted as a Son over *his own family;* whose family we are, provided we maintain our profession and our confident hope unshaken to the end;' — '*are called and established as a holy and royal priesthood.*'11 You, too, as living stones, are built up into a spiritual temple, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices that are most acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.' In the 9th verse of the same chapter, he says, 'But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood;' and this is addressed to all the brothers scattered in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.

Can *holy* and *royal* priests not thank God for the Lord's table, its bread, and cup of wine? Can they not, without a *human* priest to consecrate the way for them, approach the Lord's table and handle the bread and cup? If the common priests did not fear to approach a golden table and place upon it the loaves of the presence; if they did not fear to take and eat the consecrated bread, because they were priests according to the flesh — shall royal priests fear, without the intervention of human hands, to approach the Lord's table and partake of one loaf? If they do, they do not understand the significance of Jesus' consecration, nor do they value their high calling and exalted role as kings and priests to God. And can we not say that one who is given a little clerical authority, derived only from 'the Man of Sin and Son of Perdition,' if borrowed from the Romanists, says to them, 'stand by, I am holier than you' — can we not say that such a person is worse than Diotrephes, who sought preeminence, because he desecrates the royal priesthood of Jesus Christ and calls common and unclean those who have been consecrated by the blood of the Son of God? Such impiety can only be found among those who worship the beast and who have agreed that none shall buy or sell, except those who receive a mark on their foreheads and letters patent in their hands. But let common sense whisper a word into the ears of priests' "laymen," but Christ's '*royal priests.*' Do you not thank God for the cup while the priest stands by the table; and do you not handle the bread and cup when they come to you? And would not your thanksgiving have been just as acceptable if the human mediator had not been there, and your participation just as pleasing to God, and as comforting to yourself, if you had been the first to handle the bread or the cup, as when you are the second, or the fifty-second, in order of location? Let reason answer these two questions and see what comes of the haughty assumptions of your Protestant clergy!! But this is just a side note.

I trust it is clear that the royal priesthood may approach the Lord's table *without fear,* since they are consecrated to officiate by a blood that is far superior to that which consecrated the fleshly priesthood, just as the Lord's table, covered with the sacred symbols of the sacrifice of the Lord himself, is superior to the table that held only the twelve loaves of the presence; and as they are, at the very least, called by as holy and divine an election, and are as *chosen a race* of priests, as were those descended from the line of Levi.

# Proposition 7

***The breaking of the one loaf and the shared participation in the cup of the Lord, in remembrance of the Lord's death, commonly referred to as "the Lord's Supper," is an established part of the worship and edification of all Christian congregations in all their regular meetings.***

**Argument 1**. The first Christian congregation that met in Jerusalem, established by the twelve Apostles, attended the breaking of the loaf in their public meetings just as they did any other part of Christian worship. Luke records this in Acts 2:42: "They devoted themselves to the Apostles' teaching, to fellowship, to *the breaking of the loaf,* and to prayer." Should we not, therefore, remain just as devoted to the breaking of the loaf as we are to the teaching of the Apostles, to fellowship, and to the prayers commanded by the Apostles?

**Argument 2**. The Apostles instructed the churches to do everything the Lord commanded. Therefore, whatever the churches did by the appointment or agreement of the Apostles, they did by the command of Jesus Christ. Any acts of religious worship the Apostles taught and approved in one Christian congregation, they taught and approved in all Christian congregations, since all are under the same governance of one King. The church in Troas met on the first day of the week, which means all the churches met on the first day of the week for religious purposes.

Among the acts of worship, or the institutions of the Lord, to which the disciples attended in these meetings, the breaking of the loaf was so prominent and significant that the churches are said to meet on the first day of the week for this purpose. We are explicitly told that the disciples in Troas met for this reason; and what one church did by the authority of the Lord, as part of his instituted worship, all did. That the disciples in Troas met for this purpose is not a matter of inference; Luke states clearly in Acts 20:7: "And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together for the breaking of the loaf, Paul, ready to depart the next day, spoke to them and continued his message until midnight." From the way this meeting of the disciples at Troas is described by the historian, two things are very clear: 1. It was an established custom or rule for the disciples to meet on the first day of the week. 2. The primary purpose of their meeting was to break the loaf. Those who object to breaking the loaf every first day when the disciples are gathered often start their objections by saying that Luke does not say they broke the loaf *every* first day; yet they argue against the Sabbatarians that they should observe *every* first day to the Lord in remembrance of his resurrection. The Sabbatarians raise the same objection to this passage when it is cited by all Christians to justify the weekly observance of the first day. They claim that Luke does not tell us that they met for any religious purpose on *every* first day. How inconsistent, then, are those who use this sentence as a clear precedent for observing *every* first day when arguing against the Sabbatarians, and then turn around and say that it does not prove they broke the loaf *every* first day! If it does not prove one, it is clear it will not prove the other; for the weekly observance of this day, as a day for the disciples to meet, and the weekly breaking of the loaf in those meetings, stand or fall together. Listen again: "And on the first day of the week, when the disciples gathered to break the loaf." Now everyone must agree, who understands the meaning of words, that the gathering of the disciples and the breaking of the loaf, as far as these words are concerned, are expressed in the same terms regarding frequency. If one happened *fifty-two* times a year, or only *once,* so did the other. If they met every first day, they broke the loaf every first day; and if they did not break the loaf every first day, they did not meet every first day. But we argue from Luke's style, or from his manner of

The definite article is, in both Greek and English, used for stated fixed times, and its presence here is not merely definitive of one day, but indicates a stated or fixed day. This is true in all languages that have a definite article. Let us illustrate this with a very similar and clear case. Suppose that 500 or 1000 years from now, the annual observance of the 4th of July had ceased for several centuries, and that some individuals devoted to the original institutions of this great Republic wanted to see the 4th of every July observed as it was by the founders of the Republic during the early days of republican simplicity. Suppose that none of the records from the first century of this Republic explicitly stated that it was a regular and fixed custom for a certain group of citizens to pay particular attention to the 4th day of every July; but that a few incidental remarks in the biographies of the leading figures in the Republic referred to it as Luke has done regarding the meeting at Troas. How would this be interpreted? For example, in the biography of John Quincy Adams, it is written, A.D. 1823, "And on the 4th of July, when the republicans of the city of Washington gathered to dine, John Q. Adams delivered a speech to them." Would not an American, a thousand years from now, in such circumstances, find in these words *one* piece of evidence that it was an established practice during the first century of this Republic to regard the 4th of July as mentioned? He would tell his opponents to note that it was not said that on *a* fourth of July, as if it were a specific occurrence; but it was, in the fixed meaning of the English language, indicative of a fixed and stated day of special observance. In any case, he could not fail to convince even the most obtuse that the primary purpose of that gathering was *to dine.* Whatever the frequency or intention of that dinner, it must be acknowledged, from the words

cited above, that they *met to dine.*

Another point that may confuse the Sabbatarians and those who disregard the proper observance of the breaking of the loaf can be easily gathered from Luke's account. Paul and his companions arrived in Troas either on the evening of the first day or on Monday morning at an early hour; for he departed on Monday morning, as we would say, at an early hour; and we are clearly told that he stayed just seven days in Troas. Now, had the disciples been Sabbatarians, or observed the seventh day as a Sabbath, and broken the loaf on it as the Sabbatarians do, they would not have delayed their meeting until the first day and kept Paul and his companions waiting, as he was clearly in a hurry at this time. But his staying *seven* days and his early departure on Monday morning support the evidence presented that the first day of the week was the *fixed* and *established* day for the disciples to meet for this purpose.

From Acts 2, we learn that *the breaking of the loaf* was a regular part of the worship of the disciples in their meetings; and from Acts 20, we learn that the first day of the week was the established time for those meetings; and above all, we should note that the most prominent purpose of their meeting was to break the loaf. Other supporting evidence of the regular meeting of the disciples on the first day for religious purposes is found in the fact that Paul stated he had given instructions to all the congregations in Galatia, as well as the one in Corinth, to attend to fellowship, or the collection of contributions for the poor saints on the first day of every week. "On the first day of *every week,* let each of you set aside something in keeping with your income, so that when I come, no collections will have to be made" for the saints. *Kata mian Sabbaton* Macknight correctly translates as '*the first day of every week;*' for every linguist will agree that *kata polin* means every city; *kata menan,* every month; *kata ecclesian,* every church; and, therefore, in the same usage, *kata mian Sabbaton* means the first day of every week.

Now this sets the stage for asserting not only that the disciples in Troas gathered on the first day of every week for 'the breaking of the loaf,' but also for presenting a third argument: —

**Argument 3**. The congregation in Corinth met every first day, or the first day of every week, to proclaim the Lord's death. Let the reader remember that he has just heard that Paul commanded the church in Corinth, or every saint in Corinth, to contribute according to his ability, by putting into the treasury every first day his contributions to avoid collections when Paul came. This is widely accepted as proof of the weekly meeting of the saints. Now, with this agreement in mind, we need only to notice what is said in chapter 11:20. "When you come together in one place, that is, at least every week, *this is not to eat the Lord's supper.*" To act this way is unworthy of the purpose of your meeting. To act this way is not to eat the Lord's supper. It is not to proclaim the Lord's death. This indicates that this is the primary purpose of meeting. When a teacher reprimands his students for wasting time, he cannot remind them more effectively of the purpose of coming to school, nor criticize them more pointedly, than to say, "When you act this way, this is not to gather to learn." This is the exact meaning of the Apostle's statement, "When you gather this way, it is *not* to eat the Lord's supper." We have seen, then, that the saints met every first day in Corinth; and when they gathered in one place, it was to eat the Lord's supper, a declaration of the practice of the early congregations as clear as could be given incidentally, differing only from a direct command in the way it is expressed. But it is agreed by all that whatever the congregations did with the approval of the Apostles, they did by their authority. For the Apostles provided them with all the Christian institutions. Now, since the Apostle Paul approved their meeting every week and their coming together in one place to proclaim the Lord's death; — and only criticized their deviation from the meaning of the institution, it is as strong an authority as we could require for the practice of the weekly meeting of the disciples.
But when Acts 2:42; Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 11:20; and chap. 16:1 & 2 are compared and combined, it becomes clear that we act under the influence of apostolic teaching and example when we meet every Sunday for the breaking of bread. This is further demonstrated by a fourth argument drawn from the following fact: —

**Argument 4**. *No example can be found in the New Testament of any Christian congregation gathering on the first day of the week, except for the breaking of bread.* Let those who teach that Christians should meet on the first day of the week for reasons other than breaking bread provide an example, and only then can they challenge this fact. Until this is done, denying it must seem utterly pointless. The argument, then, is that Christians have no authority or obligation to meet on the Lord's Day for any reason other than to proclaim the Lord's death and to engage in those means of edification and comfort associated with it.

**Argument 5**. If it is not the duty and privilege of every Christian congregation to gather on the first day of every week to proclaim the Lord's death, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to demonstrate from either scripture or reason that it is their duty or privilege to meet monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually, or indeed, at all, for this purpose. From what premises can anyone argue that it is a duty or privilege to gather monthly that would not also prove it is obligatory to meet weekly? We invite scrutiny here and assert that no one can provide a single reason why it should or could be a duty or privilege for a congregation to meet monthly, quarterly, or annually that would not also prove it is their duty and privilege to gather every first day for this purpose.

**Argument 6**. Spiritual health, just like physical health, depends on nourishment. For physical health, it is essential that food not only be healthy in nature and sufficient in quantity, but also that it be consumed at proper intervals, which should be regular and fixed. Is it any different for moral health? Is there no analogy between perishable bread and the bread of life? Is there no analogy between natural and moral life — between natural and moral health? And if there is, does it not follow that if the early disciples only enjoyed good moral health when they gathered weekly to proclaim the Lord's death, then those who only meet quarterly or semi-annually for this purpose cannot enjoy good moral health?

**Argument 7**. Finally, what *commemorative* institution, in any age or under any religious system, was established by divine authority that did not have a fixed time for its observance? Was it the commemoration of the completion of creation signified in the weekly Sabbath? Was it the Passover, Pentecost, or the Feast of Tabernacles? Was it the Feast of Purim? What other significant practice had its times or occasions of observance not fixed? How often was circumcision to be performed on the same individual? How often Christian baptism? Is there a single institution commemorative of anything, the meaning or frequency of which is not clearly laid out in the Holy Scriptures, either by command or example? Not one of a *social* nature, and hardly one of an individual nature. The commemoration of the Lord's death must, therefore, be a weekly institution — an institution present in all the gatherings of the disciples for Christian worship; or it must be an anomaly — a *sui generis* thing — an institution like no other of divine origin. And can anyone explain why Christians should celebrate the Lord's resurrection *fifty-two* times a year, but his death only *once, twice,* or *twelve* times? Whoever can do this will not lack a vivid imagination, even if they may be deficient in judgment or in their familiarity with the New Testament.

# Proposition 2

***In the house of God, there is always the table of the Lord.***

Just as there is a parallel between the Jewish holy place and the Christian house of God, there is also a parallel between the furnishings of the first tabernacle or holy place and those who served in it, as well as the furnishings of the Christian house of God and those who serve in it. "In the first tabernacle," Paul said, "which is called *holy*, there were the candlestick, the table, and the showbread," or the loaves of the presence. Every Sabbath day, *twelve* loaves were placed on the golden table, displayed there for one week, and the following Sabbath, they were replaced with twelve fresh loaves sprinkled with frankincense. The loaves that were removed from the table were eaten by the priests. In Hebrew, these were called "the loaves of the faces," or the loaves of the presence. This symbol of the abundance of spiritual food in the presence of God for all who dwell in the holy place was always on the golden table provided by the twelve tribes, even in the wilderness. The light in the first tabernacle did not come from *outside*, but from the seven lamps placed on the golden candlestick; this symbolizes the perfect light not derived from this world, which is experienced in the house of God.

If, then, in the symbolic house of God, which corresponds to the Christian house of God, there was not only a table overlaid with gold, always set, with *twelve large loaves* or cakes, sacred memorials and symbols of God's bounty and grace; can we say that in that house, over which Jesus is a Son, there is not always a table more precious than gold, covered with a richer feast for the holy and royal priesthood that the Lord has established, who may always enter into the holy place consecrated by Himself?

However, we do not rely solely on analogies or far-fetched inferences to prove this point. Paul, who fully understood both the Jewish and Christian institutions, tells us that there is in the Christian temple a table, appropriately called the Lord's Table, as part of its furnishings. He warns those who were at risk of being tainted by idolatry that "they could not be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of demons." In all his references to this table in this context, he depicts it as continually approached by those in the Lord's house. "The cup of the Lord" and "the loaf," for which thanks were continually given, are the furnishings of this table, to which the Christian community has free access.

The Apostle Paul reminds the saints in Corinth of their familiarity with the Lord's table, referring to it as common as the gatherings of the community. "The cup of blessing for which we thank God, is it not the joint participation of the blood of Christ? The loaf which we break, is it not the joint participation of the body of Christ?" In this way, we speak of things that are common and usual, never of things that are uncommon or unusual. It is not the cup that we *have* received with thanks; nor is it the loaf that we *have* broken; but that which we *do* break. But all that we aim to demonstrate here is now accomplished; for it has been shown that *in the Lord's house, there is always the table of the Lord*. It is hardly necessary to add that if it is shown that in the Lord's house there is the Lord's table as part of the furnishings, it must always be there, unless it can be shown that only certain occasions require its presence, and others its absence; or that the Lord is poorer or more stingy at one time than another; that He is not always able to keep a table, or too frugal to provide it for His friends. But this is anticipating our subject, and we proceed to the third proposition.

# Objections Considered

Having written extensively on this subject before, I will now introduce a few notable figures who, since the Reformation, have advocated for this cause. We will not only introduce them to our readers but also allow them to speak for themselves. —

*John Brown,* of Haddington, author of the Dictionary of the Bible and a theology teacher for that branch of the Presbyterian church known as the "*Secession,*" has written a treatise on this subject. We will assign him the task of stating and addressing the objections to this apostolic institution. The reader will notice that there are some flaws in his style; and although his speech reveals that he has been influenced by Ashdod, his arguments are substantial and compelling.

He presents various arguments for the weekly observance of this institution and identifies and counters nine objections to the practice. Here are a few of the strongest ones: —

## Objection 1

The frequent administration of this ordinance in the apostolic and early ages of Christianity was commendable and necessary because the ongoing persecutions at that time led them to fear that every Sabbath might be their last; whereas now we are not in such danger, and therefore do not need to observe this ordinance as frequently.

### Answer

Should we not still live as if every Sabbath could be our last? Do we have a greater guarantee of life than they did? Did not many Christians in those times live to as great an age as we do now? Indeed, is it not clear from the best historians that the church was generally under no persecution for more than one-third of the time that weekly communion was practiced? But, even if they had been constantly exposed to the harshest persecution, the objection becomes even more absurd. If they attended this ordinance weekly at the risk of their lives, does it follow that now, when God provides us with greater and better opportunities for it, we should neglect it? Does God require the greatest effort from His people when He gives the least opportunity? Or does He require less effort when He provides the greatest opportunity for it? What kind of master would God be if this were the case? Furthermore, do not people need this ordinance to protect them from the influence of the world's approval as much as from its disapproval? — "Let us reverse this objection and see if it holds more weight. It would then read: The early Christians received the Lord's Supper weekly because their souls were in greater danger from the allurements and approval of the world, which are often more harmful to spiritual well-being than its disapproval; and as they had greater opportunity to do so due to their peace and freedom; yet this frequency of administration and participation is not necessary now, as we, being under the world's disapproval, are in less danger regarding our spiritual well-being; especially since we can only partake at the risk of our lives, God having explicitly stated that He values mercy more than sacrifice.

## Objection 2

The early and reforming times were periods of great spiritual vitality and significant divine influence on the souls of believers; whereas it is quite different now. Therefore, while frequent administration was commendable then, in our weakened and declining state, it is unnecessary.

### Answer

Should we visit the wells of salvation infrequently because we can only draw a little water at a time? Should we seldom try to fill our pitchers at the fountain of living waters because they are small? Is not this ordinance a remedy for restoring the weary, strengthening the weak, healing the sick, and reviving the dying believer? How reasonable is it to argue that weary, weak, sick, and dying believers should not have it administered to them often, simply because they are not in perfect health? — "Wouldn't the objection read better if reversed? The early Christians had this ordinance frequently administered to them because, being weak and sickly, and receiving only limited divine influence at once, it was necessary for them to take new meals often; whereas we, being strong and vibrant Christians, and receiving such ample supplies of grace on these occasions that enable us to walk many days under this powerful influence, have no need for such frequent attendance at an ordinance that is especially designed to strengthen weary, weak, and sickly believers.

## Objection 3

If the Lord's Supper were administered frequently, it would become less solemn and, over time, quite contemptible, as we see is the case with baptism due to the frequency of that ordinance's administration.

### Answer

Is this method of maintaining the significance of the Lord's Supper devised by God or not? If it is, where is the part of His word that supports it? I have already proven the opposite from Scripture. Since it is merely a human invention, what basis is there to believe it will genuinely uphold the significance and solemnity of the ordinance? Did not the Papists of old claim to maintain and enhance its solemnity by reducing the frequency of its administration? Did they not take the cup away from the people, which Calvin says was a natural consequence of the former? Did they not tie the administration of this ordinance to those occasions that superstition had elevated, such as Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas? Did they not attach a multitude of ceremonies to it? Did they not claim that it was a real sacrifice and that the elements were transformed by consecration into the actual body and blood of Christ? And did all this contribute to the proper significance of this ordinance? On the contrary, did it not undermine it? Although the doctrine of transubstantiation created a kind of reverence for it, was this reverence divine? Or was it not rather devilish, in worshipping the elements? Now, how can we be sure that our infrequent administration of this ordinance will more effectively uphold its solemnity? Is it not strange that we should find so much encouragement from the practice of the Apostles, the early Christians, and all the reformed churches to profane this solemn ordinance, while the most ignorant and depraved Papists serve as our original model for the course that tends to uphold its true honor and significance? What a peculiar situation this must be if, to uphold the significance of God's ordinance, we must abandon the paths of the faithful and follow the routes originally laid out by the most ignorant and wicked antichristians? "Furthermore, if our infrequent administration of this ordinance makes it solemn, would it not become even more so if administered only once every seven, ten, twenty, thirty, sixty, or a hundred years?" — "Shall we not find that those who pray once a month or hear a sermon once a year have their minds far more religiously impressed with solemn views of God than those who pray seven times a day and hear a hundred sermons in a year?

> Let us reverse this objection and see how it stands. All human attempts to make God's ordinances more solemn are criticisms of His wisdom and have always tended to bring the ordinances into contempt. But infrequent administration of the Supper is a human invention, first introduced by the worst Papists, and therefore it tends to bring contempt upon this ordinance, as we sadly see in the practice of those who choose to partake infrequently.

The means by which the weekly observance of the Supper was set aside, Mr. Brown states in the following words: —

> "The means by which the infrequent administration of this ordinance appears to have been introduced into the church do not reflect the God of truth. The causes that led to its introduction seem to have been pride, superstition, greed, and carnal complacency. The eastern hermits, withdrawing from society, took up residence in deserts and mountains, and, being far removed from the places of its administration, seldom attended. This, although truly the result of their laziness and distance, they pretended arose from their respect and reverence for this most solemn ordinance. It was easy for others to imitate them in this imagined holiness, which lay in neglecting God's ordinance, leading many of the eastern Christians to stop partaking except at times deemed solemn by superstition, such as during Passover; and they settled for being mere spectators on other occasions. Because of this practice, we find the great and eloquent Chrysostom repeatedly condemning them as guilty of the highest contempt for God and Christ, calling their practice a most wicked custom."

An objection not formally stated by Mr. Brown, which I have frequently heard, is drawn from the words, '*as often as you do this,* do it in remembrance of me.' From these words, it is argued that we are without law regarding how often we should partake; and consequently cannot be condemned for partial or total neglect: for 'where there is no law, there is no transgression.' 'As *often*' is used not to permit frequency, but to indicate the manner. 'Always do it in remembrance of me.' The context in which these words are given relates to the manner or purpose of the observance, not how often it may or may not be celebrated. It is a violation of every rule of interpretation to infer a different matter from them that was not in the Apostle's mind. Furthermore, if the words 'as often' leave it up to any group to decide how often, they are blameless if they never once, or more than once in their lives, proclaim the Savior's death. This interpretation results in an observance without reason, without law, without precedent, and consequently without obligation.

Next to Mr. Brown, we will present a few excerpts from *William King,* Archbishop of Dublin. The Editors of the *Christian Examiner* provided a very valuable excerpt from Mr. King in their May 7th issue of the first volume, from which I quote the following, pp. 163, 165, 166, 167: —
> "The following remarks on this institution of our Savior are excerpts from a '*Discourse concerning the Inventions of Men in the Worship of God,*' by William King of Ireland. He was born in Antrim in 1650, educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and held the positions of Dean of St. Patrick's, Bishop of Derry, and Archbishop of Dublin. He died in 1729. His approach in this discourse is to examine and compare the worship of God as taught in the Scriptures with the practices of the different religious groups of his time: —
> 
> 'Christ's positive command to do this in remembrance of him, etc., must obligate us at certain times and in certain places; and there can be no better way to determine when we are obliged to do it than by observing when God, in His goodness, gives us the opportunity; for either we are then obliged to do it, or we may choose whether we will ever do it or not; there being no better means of determining the frequency than this of God's giving us the opportunity. And the same rule applies to all other general positive commands, such as those that require us to show charity; we can be sure it applies here as well. Therefore, whoever disregards or neglects any opportunity of receiving what God offers him sins, just as surely as he who, being enabled by God to perform an act of charity and invited by a suitable object, neglects to help him or closes his heart of compassion against him, concerning whom the Scriptures assure us that the love of God does not dwell in him. The argument is even stronger against someone who neglects this holy ordinance; for how can it be supposed that a person has a true love for his Savior or a proper sense of His sufferings who refuses or neglects to remember the greatest of all benefits in the easiest manner, even though commanded to do so by his Redeemer and invited by a clear opportunity offered by God?
> 
> It is clear that if it is not our own fault, we may have an opportunity every Lord's Day when we meet together; therefore, that church is guilty of neglecting the command whose order and worship do not require and provide for this practice. Christ's command seems to lead us directly to it: for 'Do this in remembrance of me' implies that Christ was to leave them, that they were to meet together after He was gone, and that He required them to remember Him at their meetings while He was absent. The very purpose of our public meetings on the Lord's Day, and not on the Jewish Sabbath, is to remember and keep in our minds a sense of what Christ did and suffered for us until He comes again; and this we are obliged to do, not in a manner suggested by our own inventions, but by the means that Christ Himself has prescribed to us, that is, by celebrating this holy ordinance.
> 
> It seems likely, from the very institution of this ordinance, that our Savior intended it to be a part of God's service in all the solemn assemblies of Christians, just as the Passover was in the assemblies of the Jews. To know, therefore, how often Christ requires us to celebrate this feast, we need only inquire how often Christ requires us to meet together; that is, at least every Lord's Day.'"
> 
> Next, we will introduce a highly regarded American Rabbi, Dr. John Mason of New York. The passages I quote are found in a note attached to page 188 of the New York Edition of Fuller's Strictures on Sandemanianism.
> 
> "Mr. Fuller does not deny that the Lord's Supper was observed by the first Christians every Lord's Day (nor will this be denied by anyone who has candidly investigated the subject), but he seems to think that Acts 20:7 does not prove that it was so; others, known for their piety and depth of research, have considered this passage as providing complete proof of the weekly observance of the Lord's Supper. Dr. Scott, in his valuable Commentary, observes on this passage, '*Breaking of bread,* or commemorating the death of Christ in the Eucharist, was one chief purpose of their gathering; this ordinance seems to have been *constantly administered every Lord's Day,* and probably no professed Christians absented themselves from it after they had been admitted into the church, unless they were under some censure or had some real hindrance.'
> 
> "Dr. Mason, of this city, in his Letters on Frequent Communion, speaks on this subject with even greater certainty. 'It is well-known that during the first three centuries of the Christian era, communions were held with a frequency of which, among us, we have neither example nor resemblance. It is also well-known that the original frequency of communions declined as carnality and corruption gained ground. And it is no less well-known that it has been urged as a weighty duty by the best of men and the best churches in the best of times.'
> 
> "Weekly communion did not die with the Apostles and their contemporaries. There is a multitude of witnesses to testify that they were maintained by succeeding Christians with great care and tenderness for over two centuries. It is unnecessary to fill these pages with quotations. The fact is indisputable.
> 
> "Communion every Lord's Day was universal and was preserved in the Greek church until the seventh century; and those who neglected *three weeks* in a row were excommunicated.
> 
> "In this way, the spirit of ancient piety cherished the memory of the Savior's love. There was no need for reproof, remonstrance, or entreaty. No trivial excuses for neglect were ever heard from the lips of a Christian; for *such* neglect had not yet degraded the Christian's name. He carried within himself sufficient motivation to obey, without reluctance, the commands of his Lord. It was his choice, his comfort, his joy. These were days of life and glory; but days of dishonor and death were soon to follow; nor was there a more ominous sign of their approach than the decline of frequent communion. For as the power of religion appears in a desire to magnify the Lord Jesus continually, so its decay is first detected by the encroachment of indifference. It was in the *fourth* century that the church began very noticeably to forsake her first love.
> 
> "The excellent Calvin complains that in this day, believers, thinking they had fully discharged their duty by a single communion, resigned themselves for the rest of the year to laziness and sloth. 'It ought to have been,' he says, 'far otherwise. *Every week,* at least, the table of the Lord should have been spread for Christian assemblies; and the promises declared, by which, partaking of it, we might be spiritually fed.'"
> 
> We will now hear from the celebrated John Wesley. After *fifty-five* years of reflection on the subject, he concludes that Christians should proclaim the Lord's death every Lord's Day. He prefaces his 106th Sermon, Luke 22:19, with this remark: —
> 
> "This discourse was written over fifty-five years ago for the use of my students at Oxford. I have added very little but have cut down much; as I then used more words than I now do. But I thank God, I have not yet found cause to change my views on any point made in it."
> 
> The Sermon is titled "The Duty of Constant Communion," concerning which the Reformer says —
> 
> "It is no wonder that people who have no fear of God should never think of doing this. But it is strange that it should be neglected by anyone who does fear God and desires to save their souls; and yet nothing is more common. One reason why many neglect it is that they are so afraid of *eating and drinking unworthily* that they never consider how much greater the danger is when they do not eat or drink at all."
> 
> In speaking of *constantly* receiving the Supper, Mr. Wesley says —
> 
> "I say *constantly* receiving. For as to the phrase *frequent* communion, it is absurd to the last degree. If it means anything other than constant, it means more than can be proven to be the duty of any person. For if we are not obliged to communicate *constantly,* by what argument can it be proven that we are obliged to communicate *frequently?* Yes, more than once a year? Or once in seven years? Or once before we die? Every argument made for this either proves that we ought to do it *constantly,* or proves nothing at all. Therefore, that vague and meaningless way of speaking should be set aside by all men of understanding. Our ability is the only rule of our duty. Whatever we can do, that we ought to do. With respect to this or any other command, he who, when he may obey if he will, does not, will have no place in the kingdom of heaven."
> 
> Though we may have some objections to the way John Wesley speaks of the meaning of this institution, as we do indeed to that of all the others from whom we have quoted, we would recommend to the entire Methodistic community the careful reading of the above Sermon. It can be found in vol. 3, pp. 171-179.
> 
> The Elders among the Methodists, with whom John Wesley is such a high authority, should be reminded of his *advice* found in his Letters to America, 1784, recently quoted in the Gospel Herald, Lexington, Kentucky.
> 
> "**I also advise the elders to administer the Lord's Supper on every Lord's Day**."
> 
> So much for John Brown, John Mason, and John Wesley, and the authorities they quoted. While quoting the sayings of the Johns, I am reminded of something said by the great John Milton, the "immortal bard" of England. In his posthumous works, he says: "The Lord's Supper (which the doctrine of transubstantiation, or rather anthropophagy, has nearly turned into a banquet of cannibals) is essential to be observed, and may be administered by anyone with propriety, as well as by an appointed minister. There is no order of men that can claim either the right of distribution or the power of withholding the sacred elements, seeing that in the church we are all alike priests." "The head of a household, or anyone appointed by him, is free to celebrate the Lord's Supper from house to house, as was done in the observance of the Passover" — "all Christians are a royal priesthood; therefore, any believer is competent to act as an ordinary minister as convenience may require, provided only he is endowed with the necessary gifts, these gifts constituting his commission." Thus did the famous John Milton pave the way for the weekly observance of the Supper by removing the priestly restrictions and penances of the dark ages.
A cloud of witnesses to the clarity and evidence of the New Testament regarding the weekly celebration of the Lord's Supper could be presented. However, we believe this is unnecessary; and to avoid being lengthy and tedious, we will only add a few excerpts from the third volume of the *Christian Baptist,* 2nd ed. p. 254, to support the assertion — *all of history supports the practice of disciples meeting every first day to break bread.* —

> All of history shows that, for the *first three centuries,* all the churches broke bread once a week. Pliny, in his Epistles, Book 10; Justin Martyr, in his Second Apology for the Christians; and Tertullian, De Ora. page 135, testify that it was the universal practice in all the weekly gatherings of the brethren, after they had prayed and sung praises—

> 'Then bread and wine being brought to the *chief brother,* he takes it and offers praise and thanksgiving to the Father, in the name of the Son and Holy Spirit. After prayer and thanksgiving, the whole assembly says, *Amen!* When thanksgiving is concluded by the *chief guide,* and with the consent of the whole congregation, the *deacons* (as we call them) give to everyone present a portion of the bread and wine, over which thanks are given.'

> "The weekly communion was maintained in the Greek church until the *seventh century;* and, by one of their canons, 'those who neglected *three weeks in a row* were excommunicated.'

> "In the *fourth century,* when everything began to change due to baptized Pagans, the practice started to decline. Some councils in the western part of the Roman Empire, through their canons, tried to maintain it. The council held at Illiberis in Spain, A.D. 324, decreed that 'no offerings should be accepted from those who did not receive the Lord's Supper.'

> "The council at Antioch, A.D. 341, decreed that 'all who came to church, and heard the Scriptures read, but did not join in prayer and receiving the sacrament, should be cast out of the church until they publicly demonstrated their repentance.'

> "All these canons were unable to keep the carnal crowd of professors in a practice for which they had no spiritual appetite; and, indeed, it was likely to fall out of use altogether. To prevent this, the Council of Agatha, in Languedoc, A.D. 506, decreed that 'none should be considered good Christians who did not *communicate* at least *three times* a year — at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsunday.' This soon became the standard for a good Christian, and it was deemed presumptuous to commune more often.

> "Things continued this way for over 600 years, until they grew tired of even *three* communions in one year; and the infamous Council of Lateran, which decreed auricular confession and transubstantiation, declared that 'an annual communion at Easter was sufficient.' This association of the 'sacrament' with Easter, and the mechanical devotion of the uninformed at this time, greatly contributed to the worship of the Host. Thus, the breaking of bread in simplicity and godly sincerity once a week degenerated into a pompous sacrament once a year at Easter.

> "At the Reformation, this subject was only slightly examined by the reformers. Some of them, however, paid attention to it. Even Calvin, in his Institutes, lib. 4. chap. 17: sect. 46, says, 'And truly this custom, which requires communion once a year, *is a most evident contrivance of the Devil,* by whose instrumentality it may have been determined.'

> "And again (Inst. lib. 6, chap. 18: sect. 56,) he says, 'It ought to have been far otherwise. *Every week,* at least, the table of the Lord should have been set for Christian assemblies, and the promises declared by which, in partaking of it, we might be spiritually nourished.'

> "Martin Chemnitz, Witsius, Calderwood, and others among the reformers and debaters agree with Calvin; and, indeed, almost every commentator on the New Testament agrees with the Presbyterian Henry in his remarks on Acts 20:7. 'In the early days, it was the custom of many churches to receive the Lord's Supper every Lord's Day.'

> "The Belgic Reformed Church, in 1851, appointed the Supper to be received every other month. The Reformed Churches of France, after acknowledging that they had been too lax in observing the Supper only four times a year, recommend a *greater frequency.* The Church of Scotland began with *four* sacraments a year; but some of its ministers increased it to *twelve* times. Thus, things stood until the end of the last century.

> "Since the beginning of the current century, many congregations in England, Scotland, Ireland, and some in the United States and Canada, both Independents and Baptists, have participated in the Supper every Lord's Day, and this practice is gaining popularity every day.

> "These historical notes may be useful to those who are constantly crying out *Innovation! Innovation!* But we advocate the principle and the practice based solely on apostolic grounds. Blessed is the servant who, knowing his Master's will, does it with eagerness and joy!

> "Those who wish to see a strong refutation of the Presbyterian method of observing the sacrament, and a defense of weekly communion, would do well to read Dr. John Mason's Letters on Frequent Communion, who is himself a high-minded Presbyterian, and therefore his remarks will be more respected by his peers than mine."

Thus our seventh proposition is supported by the explicit declarations of the New Testament, by the reasonableness of the practice as suggested by the Apostles, by analogy, by the conclusions of the most prominent reformers, and by the unified voice of all Christian history. But on the clear teachings of the Lord and his Apostles, we rely for authority and instruction regarding *this* and *every other* Christian institution.

It does seem somewhat incongruous that arguments should need to be presented to encourage Christians to gather weekly around the Lord's table. It would be much more in line with the spirit of our religion to see them eagerly desiring to be honored with a seat at the King's table, asking with great interest if they might be allowed to eat in his presence so often, in recognition of his love. To have to resist their daily requests for this purpose would not be as unnatural or unreasonable as having to reason and persuade them to come together for weekly communion.

But just as a lack of appetite for physical food is a sign of poor health or impending illness, a lack of desire for spiritual nourishment indicates a lack of spiritual health or the presence of a moral disease, which, if not healed, could lead to a departure from the Living Head. Thus, among the most telling signs of spiritual decline, the most decisive is a lack of appetite for the nourishment that the Good Physician has prepared and prescribed for his family. A healthy and vigorous Christian, excluded from the use and enjoyment of all the provisions of the Lord's house, cannot be found.

However, much depends on the *manner* of celebrating the Supper, as well as the *frequency.* The simplicity of the Christian institution is evident in every part of it. While there is a form for doing everything, there is also attention to the thing signified. But there is both form and substance, and everything done must be done in some manner. The well-mannered Christian is like the well-mannered gentleman — his demeanor is graceful, easy, natural, and simple. All stiffness and forced formality are as ungraceful in the Christian as in the gentleman. A courteous and polite family is very different from a soldier's mess mates or a ship's crew in all the table's ceremonies. There is a Christian decency and order, as well as political courtesy and politeness.

Nothing is more off-putting than mimicry. It is hypocrisy in manners, which, like hypocrisy in religion, is more detestable than apathy or vulgarity. There is a saintliness in demeanor and appearance, which differs as much from true sanctity as foppery differs from politeness. The appearance of sanctimoniousness is as much to be avoided as actual moral laxity. An austere and rigid pharisaism sits as awkwardly on a Christian as a mourning outfit on a bride. Cheerfulness is not mirth — solemnity is not pharisaism — joy is not noise — nor is eating, festivity.

But to act rightly in anything, we must feel rightly. If we would show love, we must first possess it. If a person would walk humbly, they must be humble: and if one would act as a Christian on any occasion, they must always live as a Christian. People who daily converse with God and who constantly meditate on his salvation will not need to be told how they should conduct themselves at the Lord's table.

The following excerpt from my Memorandum Book provides the closest approach to the model we have in mind for good order and Christian decency in celebrating this institution. Indeed, the entire order of that congregation was commendable: —
> "The church in — — — — had about fifty members. Not having anyone they considered to fit Paul's description of a Bishop, they appointed two senior members, who had a serious demeanor, to lead their meetings. These individuals were not equipped to preach or teach; however, they were qualified to lead well and to preside with Christian dignity. One of them led each meeting. After they gathered in the morning, which was at eleven o'clock (for they had agreed to meet at eleven and to adjourn at two o'clock during the winter season), and after they greeted one another in a very friendly and warm manner, as brothers do when they meet for social purposes, the president for the day stood up and said: 'Brothers, being gathered in the name and by the authority of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, on this day of his resurrection, let us come together to celebrate his praise.' He then recited the following stanza: —

> - Christ the Lord is risen today!
>
>   Sons of men and angels say;
>
>   Raise your joys and triumphs high,
>   Sing, O heavens! and, earth, reply!"

> "The congregation stood and sang this hymn with enthusiasm. He then called on a brother, who was a very clear and expressive reader, to read a section of the gospel. He stood and read, in a very audible voice, the account of the crucifixion of the Messiah. After a brief pause, the president called on a brother to pray on behalf of the congregation. His prayer was filled with gratitude to the Father of Mercies and with requests for blessings on themselves and for all people as promised to those who ask, or for which people were instructed to pray. The language was very fitting; no meaningless repetitions, no unnecessary words, no effort to say everything that came to his mind; but to express slowly, clearly, and emphatically the desires of the heart. The prayer was relatively short; and the entire congregation, brothers and sisters, pronounced aloud the final *Amen.*

> "After the prayer, a passage from one of the Epistles was read by the president himself, and a song was requested. A brother stood up, and after naming the page, recited —

> "'Twas on that night when doomed to know
>   That eager rage of every foe;
>
>   That night in which he was betrayed
>   The Savior of the world took bread."

> "He then sat down, and the congregation sang with great feeling.

> I noticed that the table was set before the disciples gathered in the morning, and that the disciples occupied a few benches on each side of it, while the visitors sat on more distant seats. The president stood and said that our Lord had a table for his friends, and that he invited his disciples to share a meal with him. 'In memory of his death, this memorial table,' he said, 'was established; and as the Lord lives forever in heaven, so he lives forever in the hearts of his people. Just as the first disciples, taught by the Apostles in person, came together in one place to partake of the Lord's supper, and as they chose the first day of the week in honor of his resurrection for this purpose; so we, having the same Lord, the same faith, and the same hope as they, have vowed to do as they did. We owe as much to the Lord as they did; and we ought to love, honor, and obey him as they did.' Having said this, he took a small loaf from the table, and in one or two sentences gave thanks for it. After giving thanks, he raised it in his hand, broke it significantly, and handed it to the disciples on each side of him, who passed the broken loaf from one to another until they all partook of it. There was no stiffness, no formality, no pageantry; everything was easy, familiar, solemn, and cheerful. He then took the cup in a similar manner, gave thanks for it, and handed it to the disciples sitting next to him, who passed it around; each one serving his brother until all were served. The thanksgiving before breaking the loaf and before passing the cup was as brief and relevant to the occasion as the thanks usually offered at a common table for the ordinary blessing of God's bounty. They then stood and, in unison, sang —

> - To him that loved the sons of men,
>   And washed us in his blood;
>
>   To royal honors raised our heads,
>   And made us priests to God!"

> "The president of the meeting called on a brother to remember the poor and those unaware of the way of life before the Lord. He knelt down, and all the brothers united with him in praying to the Father of Mercies on behalf of all the sons and daughters of affliction; the poor and the destitute, and for the conversion of the world. After this prayer, the fellowship, or contribution, was addressed; and the entire church demonstrated the sincerity of their desires through the cheerfulness and generosity they showed in giving to the treasury as the Lord had prospered them.

> "A general invitation was extended to all the members if they had anything to propose or inquire about that would edify the body. Several brothers stood in succession and read various passages from the Old and New Testaments related to some matters that had been subjects of previous investigation and inquiry. Various remarks were made; and after singing several spiritual songs chosen by the brothers, the president, on the motion of a brother who indicated that the time to adjourn had come, concluded the meeting by pronouncing the apostolic blessing.

> "I understand that all these elements were present in all their meetings; yet the order of attendance was not always the same. On all occasions when I was present with them, no one spoke without invitation or without asking permission from the president, and no one left the meeting before the hour of adjournment without special permission. Nothing seemed to be done in a formal or ceremonious manner. Everything displayed the power of godliness as well as its form; and no one could attend to all that took place without being edified and convinced that the Spirit of God was present. The joy, affection, and reverence that were evident in this small assembly were the strongest arguments in favor of their order and the best commentary on the excellence of the Christian institution."

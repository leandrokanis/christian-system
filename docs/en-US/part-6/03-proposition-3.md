# Proposition 3

***On the Lord's Table There Is Necessarily Only One Loaf***

The necessity is not that of a positive law requiring one loaf and only one, as the ritual of Moses required twelve loaves. Rather, it is a necessity that arises from the meaning of the Institution as explained by the Apostles. Just as there is only one literal body, and only one mystical or figurative body with many members, there must also be only one loaf. The Apostle emphasizes this, saying, "Because there is one loaf, we, the many, are one body; for we are all partakers of that one loaf."<sup>8</sup> The Greek word *artos*, especially when combined with numbers, as Dr. Macknight notes, always means *a loaf*, and is translated that way in our Bibles: "Do you not remember the *five loaves?*"<sup>9</sup> There are many similar examples. Dr. Campbell states that in the plural, it should always be translated as loaves; but when there is a numeral before it, it must be translated as a loaf or loaves. Thus we say one loaf, seven loaves; not one bread, seven breads. "Because there is one loaf," Paul says, we must consider the entire congregation as one body. Here the Apostle reasons from what is clearer to what is less clear; from what was established to what was not as fully established in the minds of the Corinthians. There was no dispute about the one loaf; therefore, there should be none about the one body. This method of reasoning makes it as certain as a positive law: because what an Apostle reasons from must be an established fact or principle. To argue from an assumption or a contingency to establish the unity of the body of Christ would be absurd for a logician, and how unworthy of an Apostle! It was, then, an established institution that there is only one loaf, since the Apostle supports his argument by referencing an established fact. Our third proposition is, therefore, upheld that *on the Lord's table there is necessarily only one loaf*.

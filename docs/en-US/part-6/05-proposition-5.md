# Proposition 5

***The one loaf must be broken before the saints feast upon it, which has given this institution the name of "breaking the loaf."***

But some will surely ask, "Is it not called *the Lord's Supper?*" Some, including Dr. Bell, have thought that 1 Cor. 11:20 applies to love feasts or charity gatherings, rather than to the remembrance of the Lord's death. They might interpret the passage this way: — "But your coming together in one place is not to eat a Lord's supper; for in eating it, each one takes his own supper first," suggesting that this refers to a love feast eaten before *the breaking of the loaf.* However, this Lord's supper is clearly distinguished from their *own* supper. Might it not be just as reasonable to say that you cannot call *your* remembrance of the Lord's death a Lord's supper, since before eating it, you have already had your own supper, which prevents you from making it a *supper*? You do not make it a Lord's supper if you first eat your own supper. Nor could the Corinthians call any meal a "Lord's supper," given how they conducted their own meals; one person ate and drank to excess, while another, who was poor or had no supper to bring, went hungry and was put to shame. Could this be called a supper in honor of the Lord?

Since the Lord had eaten a religious supper, having partaken of the paschal lamb with his disciples before he instituted the breaking of the loaf and drinking of the cup as a remembrance of his death, it seems inappropriate to call it a supper; for it was instituted and eaten *after a supper.* It cannot be called either dinner or supper in the sense of one of the meals of the day, as it does not replace any meal. *Deipnos,* rendered here as *supper,* in the days of Homer referred to breakfast. It also signified food in general or a feast.

In the times of Demosthenes, it referred to a feast or an evening meal. However, it is more important to note that in the New Testament, it is used both literally and figuratively. Thus, we have gospel blessings compared to a supper. We read of the 'marriage supper of the Lamb' and 'the supper of the Great God.' Jesus says, "If anyone opens the door to me, I will (*deipneso*) eat supper with him and he with me." When used this way, it does not refer to the time of day or the quantity eaten. If applied to this institution, it is figuratively, as it is also called "*the feast.*" For not only did the Lord appoint it, but in eating it, we have communion with the Lord. The same phrasing with the addition of the article occurs in Rev. 1:10, '*he kuriake hemera,*' the Lord's day. Overall, it seems more likely that the Apostle uses the words *kuriakos deipnos,* or Lord's supper, as applicable to the breaking of the loaf for which they gave thanks in honor of the Lord, rather than to their own supper or the love feasts common among the brethren. If we say, in accordance with the Apostle's style, the Lord's day, the Lord's table, the Lord's cup, we may also say the Lord's supper. For in the Lord's house, these are all sacred to him.

Since calling biblical things by biblical names is an important aspect of the current reformation, we may take this opportunity to note that both "the Sacrament" and "the Eucharist" are of human origin. The former was a name adopted by the Latin church because the observance was thought to be an oath or vow to the Lord; and since the term *sacramentum* signified an oath taken by a Roman soldier to be loyal to his general and his country, they presumed to call this institution a sacrament or oath to the Lord. The Greek church calls it *the Eucharist,* which means *the giving of thanks,* because thanks were offered for the loaf and the cup before participating. It is also called communion, or "*the communion of the saints*;" but this might suggest that it is exclusively *the* communion of saints; therefore, it is more consistent to literally call it 'the breaking of the loaf.' But this is just the preliminary to illustrating and proving our fifth proposition.

We have stated that the loaf must be broken before the saints partake of it. Jesus took a loaf from the paschal table and broke it before giving it to his disciples. They received a broken loaf, symbolizing his body once whole, but by his own choice, broken for his disciples. In eating it, we remember that the Lord's body was broken or wounded for us by his own consent. Therefore, the one who gives thanks for the loaf should break it, not as the representative of the Lord, but following his example; and after the disciples have partaken of this loaf, handing it to one another, or while they are partaking of it, the disciple who breaks it shares in the broken loaf with them — thus they all have communion with the Lord and with one another in eating the broken loaf. In this way, they, as priests, feast upon his sacrifice. For the priests ate of the sacrifices and were thus partakers of the altar. The proof of all this is found in the institution given in Matt. 26:1-75, Mark 14:1-72, Luke 22:1-71, and 1 Cor. 11:1-34. In each of these, his breaking of the loaf, *after* giving thanks, and *before* his disciples partook of it, is clearly stated.

It is not surprising, therefore, that the literal designation of this institution should be what Luke has called it in his Acts of the Apostles thirty years after its institution. The first time he mentions it is in Acts 2:42, when he emphatically calls it *te klasei tou artou,* the breaking of the loaf, a name that was universally understood at the time of his writing, A.D. 64. For, he says, in recording the piety and devotion of the first converts, "they continued steadfast in the teaching of the Apostles, in fellowship, in *the breaking of the loaf,* in prayers — praising God." It is true, there is more than just breaking a loaf in this institution. However, according to general, if not universal usage, the first or most prominent aspect of laws, institutions, and practices often gives them their name. Thus we have our *Habeas Corpus,* our *Fieri Facias,* our *Nisi Prius,* our *Capias,* our *Venditioni Exponas,* names derived from the first words of the law.

To break a loaf, or *to break bread,* was a common phrase among the Jews to denote ordinary eating for refreshment. For example, Acts 2:46 states, "Daily, with one accord, they continued in the temple and in breaking bread from house to house. They ate their *food* with gladness and simplicity of heart." Also, after Paul had restored Eutychus at Troas, we are told he broke a loaf and ate. Here it must refer to himself, not only because it is used *indefinitely,* but because he who eats is the same person who breaks the loaf. However, when an established usage is referenced, the article or some definite term clarifies what is being referred to. Thus, in Acts 2:42, it is '*the* breaking of *the* loaf.' And in Acts 20:7, it is 'They assembled for *the* breaking of the loaf.' This loaf is explained by Paul in 1 Cor. 10:16, '*The* loaf which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?' This proposition being now, as we believe, sufficiently evident, we shall proceed to state our sixth.

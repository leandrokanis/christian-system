# 11. The Attributes of a True Sin-Offering

A single action or event often involves, for better or worse, a family, a nation, or an empire. Who can count the effects or implications of the rise or fall of a Caesar, a Hannibal, or a Napoleon? A single victory, like that of Zama or Waterloo; a single revolution, like those in England or America, can sometimes determine the fate of the world. Actions and events can only be understood through their implications and effects on every person and thing they touch. The relationships, connections, and critical dependencies among people and actions are often so numerous and varied that it is rarely, if ever, within human power to calculate the consequences or the significance of even one of the many prominent actions in a person's life.

Who could have predicted, or who can predict, the moral or political implications of Joseph being sold to a group of Ishmaelites — of Moses being placed in a basket among the reeds on the Nile — of David being anointed king of Israel — of the division of the twelve tribes under Rehoboam — of Judas's betrayal, Stephen's martyrdom, Paul's conversion, Constantine the Great's rise, Julian's apostasy, the crusades against the Turks, Luther's reformation, the revival of learning, or any of the significant movements of our time? How difficult, then, is it to assess the rebellion of Satan, the fall of Adam, and the death of Christ, in all their implications for the fate of the universe!

Before a remedy for sin can be devised or appreciated, understanding its implications for God and humanity, for time and eternity, for heaven and earth, is an essential prerequisite. But who possesses this knowledge, or what uninspired person can attain it? At best, we know only in part; therefore, we can only partially explain anything. How challenging, then, is it to form a satisfactory understanding of sin and its remedy — of Adam's fall and Christ's death!

However, it would greatly enhance our understanding of Christ's death and illustrate the nature and purpose of *sin-offerings* if we could obtain accurate and scriptural views of sin in its necessary consequences or in its significant implications for the universe. Indeed, some understanding of these aspects of sin is essential for our perception and appreciation of the wisdom, justice, and grace of the Christian system. It is not enough to hold a few vague and unclear notions of its tendencies or of its relationship to God, ourselves, and others: we must have clear and definite views of the relationships in which God stands to us, and we to Him and to one another, and how sin affects us all in these relationships. That it has a unique impact on each of us in all these relationships will, we believe, be acknowledged without dispute.

God has various relationships with the intellectual and moral creation. He is our Father, our Lawgiver, and our King. His feelings as a father, and his character as a lawgiver and sovereign, are equally involved in the implications and aspects of sin. The influence of sin on ourselves is also diverse and multifaceted. It affects the heart, the conscience, the entire soul and body of a person. It alienates our affections and even breeds hatred in our minds toward both God and humanity. As an ancient saying goes, "We hate those we have wronged;" and having offended God our Father, we are, for that very reason, filled with enmity against Him. It also oppresses and pollutes the conscience with guilt and fear, enslaves our passions, and leads to the destruction of the body. It alienates people from one another, weakens the authority of the law, and undermines its usefulness; and if not subdued, it would ultimately overthrow the throne and government of God. If not restrained and eliminated, it would fill the universe with chaos and disorder — with universal misery and ruin.

To avoid going into further details, we can observe, based on the premises already presented: 
1. Every sin wounds the affection of our heavenly Father. 
2. It insults and dishonors His law and authority in the eyes of His other subjects. 
3. It alienates our hearts from Him. 
4. It oppresses our conscience with guilt and fear. 
5. It severs us from society through its morbid selfishness and disregard for others. 
6. It leads to new violations and habitual disregard for what is right. 
7. It subjects us to shame and contempt — our bodies to the dust, and our souls to eternal separation from the presence of the Lord.

These seven points serve as a sample of the loss incurred and the harm caused by our transgressions. They illustrate how many aspects of sin must be considered before we can form a proper estimate of a suitable and sufficient sin offering or remedy.

Now, as far as we have been able to trace the tendencies and implications of transgression in the above enumeration, we must find in the *sin offering* a remedy and an antidote that fully addresses all these aspects; otherwise, it will be utterly worthless and ineffective in the eyes of enlightened reason, as well as in the righteous judgment of God, to atone for sins, to remove them, and to prevent their recurrence.

Do we need to demonstrate that humanity itself cannot provide such a sin offering? Do we need to raise Micah's question again — "With what shall I come before the Lord and bow down before the Most High God? Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?" Will repentance for the past and future improvement restore things to how they were; raise the murdered dead; repair lost fortunes, and restore broken lives? Will tears, groans, and anguish honor a violated law, uphold a righteous government, vindicate the Divine character, and prevent future wrongs? Have they ever done so? Can they ever do so? Surely, we can be excused for not attempting to prove that we have neither a tear, nor a sigh, nor an agony, nor a lamb, nor a kid of our own making, to offer to the Lord, even if such a sacrifice could meet all the implications of the case!

Every transgression, even the smallest, like eating a forbidden apple, subjects the transgressor to destruction. One sin, committed by one man, has brought the entire human race into death. The life of the transgressor is demanded in the mildest terms of insulted justice. Hence, in the law of the typical sin offerings, we find it written: "The *life* of the flesh is in the *blood:* and I have given it to you upon the altar, to make an atonement for your souls: **for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.**" [1] But such blood, such lives as the law required could not, Paul and Common Sense being the judges, take away sin. They could only foreshadow a *life* and a *blood* that could truly, justly, and honorably atone for it. Thus, *the death of Christ* is brought to our attention by the law, by the prophets, and by the necessity of the situation, with enlightened Reason in the chair, as the only real, true, and proper sin-atoning offering. It meets not only the above seven points but all others that have occurred to the human mind; and thus secures the union and harmony of things on earth and in heaven, in the unbreakable bonds of an everlasting brotherhood.

1. "In bringing many sons to glory," it comforts and delights the wounded love of our kind and benevolent heavenly Father—
2. "It magnifies and honors" His violated law and insulted government—
3. It reconciles our hearts thoroughly and forever to God, as an undeniable proof and pledge of His wonderful and incomprehensible love for us—
4. It effectively relieves our conscience by "cleansing us from all sin," and produces within us a divine serenity, a peace and joy "unspeakable and full of glory"—
5. It also reconciles us to our fellow humans, filling us with brotherly affection and universal goodwill, because it unites us all in faith, hope, and joy, as joint heirs of immortality and eternal life—
6. It serves as the most effective guard against new violations of the divine law, and powerfully deters us from sin by revealing its diabolical nature and terrible consequences; showing us in the person of God's only begotten and beloved Son, when a sin offering, the impossibility of escape from the just and retributive punishment of insulted and indignant Heaven — and
7. It is a ransom from death, a redemption from the grave, such a deliverance from the guilt, pollution, power, and punishment of sin, that greatly elevates the children of God above all they could have attained or enjoyed under the original constitution. It presents a new creation to our view; — new heavens, new earth, new bodies, new life, new joys, new glories. He who conquered death by dying, who now sits upon the throne says, "Behold, I make all things new." "He has become the Author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him."

Let no one think that in this examination of the aspects in which sin and sin offerings must be considered before we can rationally judge the necessity, suitability, and sufficiency of Christ's death, we have attempted to present a complete view of these aspects. We are not capable of such a task. Life is too short, and our opportunities too limited, to learn all the implications of transgression for ourselves, the throne and government of God, and His other subjects. We only intend to provide a sample of the points that must be addressed in a proper sin offering. These points place it beyond the reach of all human, angelic, or created mediators, victims, or sacrifices to atone for sin. As far as we can comprehend this remarkable subject, we are increasingly convinced that nothing less than the voluntary sacrifice of the Son of God could remove sin; and make it both just, merciful, honorable, and safe, on the part of His God and Father, to forgive and save one of His rebellious creation. Nor would it have been just, in our understanding, to have compelled Him to bear our iniquities, or to suffer the just for the unjust; to inflict on an innocent person the punishment for our offenses; but it was both just and kind on the part of our heavenly Father to accept for us the voluntary surrender of His Son as a willing sacrifice for our sins. "Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!"

# 1. The Universe

**One** God, one system of nature, one universe. That universe is made up of countless systems, which, in perfect harmony, move forward in subordination to one supreme purpose. That one purpose of all things is the sovereign and infinite pleasure of Him who inhabits eternity and fills the universe with His presence. So worship and adore the heavenly hierarchies, saying: — "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you created all things, and for your pleasure they exist and were created."

The universe is a system of systems, not only with respect to the seventy-five million suns and their attendant planets, which fill the already discovered fields of ethereal space; but also in reference to the various systems, separate yet united; distinct yet blended; diverse yet uniform; which are but component parts of every solar system — of every planet in that system, and of every organic and inorganic mass on each planet. Thus, in the person of a single individual man, we have an animal system, an intellectual system, a moral system, running into each other, and connecting themselves with everything of a kindred nature in the whole universe of God: just as we have in the human body itself a system of solids and a system of fluids; and these again forming themselves into a system of bones, a system of nerves, a system of arteries, a system of veins, etc.

Now, since no one system is isolated and independent, no system can be understood abstractly. Every particular system must be viewed in relation to the system that is closest to it in nature and function. Thus we view the bones in the human body as connected with the muscles, the muscles as connected with the nerves, the nerves as connected with the arteries, the arteries as connected with the veins — and all these as connected with the entire human frame, and with the fluids produced by them or circulated through them, etc.

As the systems of the universe and the sciences that study them run into each other and mutually lend and borrow light, illustration, and development; it is a sign of weakness of mind, rather than strength; of folly, rather than wisdom; for anyone to speak dogmatically with an air of infallibility, or to assume the attitude of perfect understanding on any one subject of human thought, without an intimate knowledge of the whole universe. But since such knowledge is beyond the grasp of frail mortal man, whose horizon is a point of creation, and whose days are but a moment of time, it is highly inappropriate for any son of science or religion to claim that this or that outcome is absolutely irrational, unjust, or incompatible with the plans of eternal Providence, or the purposes of supreme wisdom and benevolence, unless he is guided by the oracles of infallible wisdom or the inspirations of the Almighty. Who could judge the wisdom and usefulness of a single joint without knowing the limb to which it belongs; of that limb without understanding the body it serves; of that body without a clear perception of the world in which it moves and the relationships it sustains; of that world without some knowledge of the solar system of which it is but a small part; of that particular solar system without a general and even intimate knowledge of all the related systems; of all these related systems without a thorough understanding of the ultimate design of the whole creation; of that ultimate design without perfect knowledge of that incomprehensible Being by whom, and for whom, all things were created and made? How gracefully, then, does unassuming modesty fit all human reasoning. The true philosopher and the true Christian, therefore, always delight to appear in the unaffected attire of humility, openness, and teachability —

> What varied beings people every star,

> May tell why God has made us as we are."

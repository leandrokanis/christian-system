# 1. The Universe

**One** God, one system of nature, one universe. That universe is made up of countless systems, which, in perfect harmony, move forward in subordination to one supreme purpose. That one purpose of all things is the sovereign and infinite pleasure of Him who inhabits eternity and animates the universe with His presence. So worship and adore the heavenly hierarchies, saying: — "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for You have created all things, and for Your pleasure they are and were created."

The universe is a system of systems, not only regarding the seventy-five million suns and their accompanying planets that fill the already discovered fields of ethereal space; but also in reference to the various systems, separate yet united; distinct yet combined; heterogeneous yet homogeneous; which are merely component parts of every solar system — of every planet in that system, and of every organic and inorganic mass on each planet. Thus, in the person of a single individual, we have an animal system, an intellectual system, a moral system, intertwining and connecting with everything of a similar nature in the whole universe of God: just as we have in the human body itself a system of solids and a system of fluids; and these again forming themselves into a system of bones, a system of nerves, a system of arteries, a system of veins, etc.

Now, since no one system is isolated and independent, no system can be understood in isolation. Every particular system must be viewed in relation to the system that is closest to it in nature and function. Thus, we view the bones in the human body as connected with the muscles, the muscles as connected with the nerves, the nerves as connected with the arteries, the arteries as connected with the veins — and all of these as connected with the entire human frame, and with the fluids produced by them or circulated through them, etc.

As the systems of the universe and the sciences that study them intersect and mutually lend and borrow light, illustration, and development; it is a sign of weakness of mind, rather than strength; of folly, rather than wisdom; for anyone to dogmatize with an air of infallibility, or to assume the position of perfect understanding on any one subject of human thought, without an intimate knowledge of the whole universe. But since such knowledge is not within the reach of frail mortal man, whose horizon is a point of creation, and whose days are but a moment in time, it is extremely inappropriate for any person of science or religion to claim that this or that outcome is absolutely irrational, unjust, or unfitting the plans of eternal Providence, or the purposes of supreme wisdom and benevolence, unless guided by the oracles of infallible wisdom or the inspirations of the Almighty. Who could judge the wisdom and utility of a single joint without knowledge of the limb to which it belongs; of that limb, without understanding the body to which it serves; of that body, without a clear perception of the world in which it operates, and of the relationships it maintains; of that world, without some familiarity with the solar system of which it is just a small part; of that particular solar system, without a general and even intimate knowledge of all the related systems; of all these related systems, without a thorough understanding of the ultimate purpose of the entire creation; of that ultimate purpose, without a perfect understanding of that incomprehensible Being by whom, and for whom all things were created and made? How gracefully, then, does unassuming modesty adorn all the reasoning of man. The true philosopher and the true Christian, therefore, always delight in appearing in the genuine attire of humility, openness, and teachability —

> What varied beings people every star,

> May tell why God has made us as we are."

# 26. The Christian Discipline

Members should be publicly received into all societies. They are so in the state. It is a matter of record. When a person is regenerated and desires to be enrolled among the disciples meeting in any one place, if their confession of salvation or baptism has not been publicly known to the brethren, it makes sense that those who are aware of the fact and can attest to their confession should introduce them to the congregation, and they should be welcomed or received as such by the brethren with whom they unite. This is clearly demonstrated by even a slight consideration of propriety, reason, and the nature of things. Letters of recommendation were the method used in apostolic times as a substitute for this formal introduction when a citizen of the kingdom visited any community where they were personally unknown to the brethren.

A person cannot be under the oversight or discipline of a congregation unless they voluntarily associate with the brethren meeting in that place, and unless it is widely known or recorded among the brethren that they are one of them. There can be no formal exclusion if there is no formal reception. If there is no visible and formal union, there can be no visible and formal separation. In truth, there can be no discipline in any congregation unless it is an organized body; and no body can be organized unless it is known who its members are. On such a matter of plain common sense, we have seldom felt it necessary to say a word, and would not have mentioned it at all had we not found some societies that cannot identify their own members, and that even hesitated about the necessity of formally receiving any person into them or having a record of who belonged to them. They demanded a positive commandment or precedent for such a reception. They might as well have demanded a positive commandment for people to be formally married before they could be recognized as husband and wife, as to ask for a positive commandment for one of the most common dictates of reason. Indeed, every commandment addressed to Christian congregations regarding relative duties and privileges assumes the principle that those who belong to any society are known to each other to belong to it; otherwise, they could not even perform the first duty to one another—they could not know when they were assembled—they could not "wait for one another."

Whether there should be a record in print, in writing, or in the memory of all the congregation is a question that must depend on circumstances. If all the members have perfect memories and never forget who the members are, when they became members, when someone was received, when someone was excluded—if every brother and sister can remember these matters so well that when the discipline of the congregation or any specific question regarding a case of discipline arises, they can remember all about it; then, in that case, it is unnecessary to have any record, church book, secretary, or anything written or printed. But if not, there must be a record; because questions involving the peace and good order of society may arise, and have arisen, which require infallible testimony or the most satisfactory evidence on questions of fact; such as, Was A B ever a member of your community? When did they become a member? When were they excluded? When were they restored? When did they forsake the assembly of the brethren? Were they a husband at the time of their removal? etc.

Two things are paramount in all cases of discipline brought before the congregation—*the Fact and the Law*. The fact is always to be established by good testimony or by the confession of the transgressor. Once the fact is established, the next question is, *What is the law in this case?* The president of the congregation states the proven fact and lays the law before the brethren. They are to be judges of both the fact and the law, and when both are clearly presented, the question is put. The congregation decides. — This is the oracle of reason—of civil law in all civilized countries; and it is the oracle of the Savior and his Apostles. Private offenses, public offenses, and those that are mixed are to be decided according to what is written in the Book. This must be known; therefore, after the formation of a congregation, the first lessons to be learned are those concerning the relative duties of the brethren; and discipline among these first lessons stands out prominently. It is too late to learn the law after a case occurs. When there are no cases of discipline in a congregation, then is the time for the brethren to be taught the will of the Lawgiver, so they may be prepared to act with promptness and prudence when required.

"Offenses must come;" and, if possible, they must be healed. To cut off an offender is good; to restore them is better; but to prevent them from falling is best of all. The Christian spirit and system both emphasize vigilance in prevention; all expediency in healing offenses; and all firmness in removing incorrigible offenders. Its disciplinary code is exceedingly simple, rational, and benevolent. It teaches us to regard all offenses as acts of impiety or acts of immorality; sins against our brethren or sins against God alone; the omission of right or the commission of wrong.

Trespasses against our brethren are all matters of aggression upon their persons, property, or character. They can be either private or public. We can only offend against the person, property, or character of a brother; and we can do this only privately or publicly. Christ's legislation on private or personal offenses, as recorded in the 18th chapter of Matthew, is commendable to both Jew and Gentile all over the world. It is as clear and excellent as his golden rule of moral feeling.

Without giving any rules to decide who is the aggressor or the aggrieved, allowing either party to view the matter as they please, he commands the one who believes they are aggrieved to go to the aggressor and tell them their fault privately. If restitution is made and reconciliation achieved, the matter ends. If not, they take a second or a third person with them, state the facts of the case, reason, and remonstrate. If this also fails, then they are commanded to inform the church of the matter; and if the aggressor will not listen to the church, then they are to be treated as a heathen or a tax collector.

Some, indeed, find a difficulty in this case; for after "*tell*" there is no *it* in the original; and they ask, '*What is to be told to the church—the original fault,* or *simply that the aggressor will not make restitution?*' The most natural interpretation of the sentence favors the simple statement of the fact—that an offense has been committed and restitution refused, without going into the details of the trespass. But a second difficulty has been suggested regarding how the congregation is to be informed. Is it to be told to the whole community in full assembly? or to those appointed by the congregation to hear and adjudicate such matters? Certainly, the congregation has ears as well as a tongue, and it is not all ears nor all tongue. Every well-organized church has its elders, who hear all such matters and who bring them before the whole assembly only when absolutely necessary, and even then at a convenient time.

The elders hear the matter; and if the case requires a special committee, which Paul calls "secular seats of judgment," 1 Cor. 6:4, they appoint it; then, and not until then, if their decision is refused, do they bring it before the whole congregation, and the person is excluded from among them, so they may be treated as a heathen or a tax collector—one entitled only to civil, and not to Christian respect—one whose company is to be avoided rather than sought.

The whole community can act, and ought to act, in receiving and excluding persons: but in the aggregate, it can never become judges of offenses or a tribunal for trial. Such an institution was never established by divine authority. No community is composed only of wise and discreet adults. The Christian church includes older men, younger men, and new believers. Should the voice of a new believer be heard or counted as a vote in a case of discipline? What is the use of bishops in a church if everyone is to rule—of judges, if all are judges of fact and law? No wonder that disputes, heartburnings, and scandals of all sorts disturb these communities ruled by a democracy of the whole—where everything is to be judged in public and full assembly. Such is not the Christian system. It ordains that certain individuals shall judge and rule, and that all things shall "be done decently and in order."

Besides matters of private trespass between brethren, there are matters of public wrong, or acts of injustice towards the whole Christian community, and also towards those outside. Drunkenness in a believer, for example, is a sin against God and against all the Christian brotherhood. It is, moreover, a public nuisance to all people, as far as it is witnessed or known. The transgressor in such a case, if they are not penitent and do not reform, must be convicted of the offense. An attempt to convict them of the offense should not be made until they fail to acknowledge it. A failure to acknowledge, or an attempt to deny, calls for conviction and precludes the idea of repentance.

In all cases of conviction, the church is to be addressed through its leaders. No private individual has the right to accuse anyone before the whole community. The charge, in no case, is to be brought before the whole congregation. Such a procedure has no precedent in the Law or in the Gospel—in any well-regulated society, church, or state. If, then, any brother falls into any public offense, those who are aware of it should notify the elders of the church, or those presiding over it at the time, of the fact and the evidence on which they rely. The matter is then in the hands of the appropriate persons. They investigate it; and upon the denial of the accused, seek to convict them of the allegation.
When a person is convicted of any offense, he is unworthy of the confidence of the community; for conviction implies concealment and denial; and these, of course, are evidence of unrepentance. We do not say that such a person can never be worthy of that confidence again; but until he has provided satisfactory proof of genuine repentance, he should be treated as someone not part of the body of Christ.

In all cases of hopeful repentance, the wrongdoer is to be restored with admonition. The acknowledgment of an offense and repentance for it should, in all cases, be as public as the sin itself. Peter's sin and repentance are as public as his name. So was David's. So should be the cases of all wrongdoers. Those who have caused the Savior and his faithful followers to feel shame should themselves be made to feel shame before the world; and if their sorrow and change are genuine, they will do so willingly and completely. "Those who sin should be rebuked publicly, so that others may also fear." 1 Tim. 5:20.

On the subject of *exclusion,* or what is commonly called *excommunication,* which places the subject in the position of a pagan or tax collector to the entire Christian community, all Protestant denominations seem to agree. The Baptist Discipline, appended to the Confession of Faith taken from the works of Dr. John Owen, Dr. Goodwin, and other Congregationalists and Independents, speaks in full harmony with our views — 9th edition, 1798, p. 20. — "The manner of proceeding with this great and serious instituted ordinance is that the church, having gathered together, gives the offender notice to come and make his answer and defense (if he does not come, he aggravates his offense by disregarding the authority of Christ in his church). The body of the church should be fully aware of the offender's crime and the full proof thereof as a matter of fact; and after careful consideration and consulting the guidelines provided in the word of God, whether the offender is present or absent, the minister or elder asks the whole church whether they believe the person guilty of the crime now proven against him is worthy of the church's censure for the same. The members generally give their judgment; if it is in the affirmative, then the judgment of the members, or the majority of them, is taken, and the pastor, minister, or elder summarizes the church's sentence, explains the nature of the crime, and the appropriateness of the censure according to gospel principles; and having done this, a proper time is set to carry out the sentence; at which time the pastor, minister, or elder of the church, as his role and duty require, is to lay out the seriousness of such a sin, with all the aggravating circumstances, and show what an abominable scandal such an offender has become to religion, what dishonor it brings to God, etc., applying the relevant scripture passages to charge the offense directly to the conscience of the offender, if present, so that others may also fear; also showing the serious nature of this great censure, and its main purpose, which is the salvation and not the destruction of the soul, and with much solemnity in the entire congregation, calling upon God for his gracious presence and blessing upon this sacred ordinance, so that the great purpose may be achieved. Still expressing the deep sense the church has of the fall of this brother, with the great humility of the church, and great sorrow for, and detestation of, the sin committed. The pastor, minister, or elder, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of the congregation, and with the consent and according to the judicial sentence of the church, cuts off and excludes such an offender by name, both from the union and communion of the church, because of his offenses; so that such a person is no longer to be regarded, considered, or counted as a brother or member of such a church, until God restores him again through repentance."

Whether it is always wise in the early stages of every case of discipline to have open doors, or whether some cases may require closed doors, are questions left to human judgment; but in the case of the final decision of the congregation, and in that of exclusion, there can be only one opinion on the necessity and usefulness of it being done in the presence of all who wish to attend.

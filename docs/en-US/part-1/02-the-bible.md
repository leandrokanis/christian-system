# 2. The Bible

One God, one moral system, one Bible. If nature is a system, religion is no less so. God is "a God of order," which means he is a God of system. Nature and religion, the products of the same supreme intelligence, reflect the image of one father; twin sisters of the same Divine parentage. There is an intellectual and a moral universe as clearly defined as the system of material nature. Man belongs to all three. He is an animal, intellectual, and moral being. *Sense* is his guide in nature, *faith* in religion, *reason* in both. The Bible considers man primarily in his spiritual and eternal relationships. It is the history of nature only to the extent necessary to show man his origin and destiny; for it views nature, the universe, only in relation to man's body, soul, and spirit.

The Bible is to the intellectual and moral world of man what the sun is to the planets in our system;—the fountain and source of light and life, spiritual and eternal. There is not a spiritual idea in the entire human race that is not drawn from the Bible. Just as soon as the philosopher finds an independent sunbeam in nature, the theologian will find a spiritual conception in man, independent of **The One Best Book**.

The Bible, or the Old and New Testaments, in Hebrew and Greek, contains a complete and perfect revelation of God and his will, suited to man as he currently is. It speaks of man as he was, and also as he will be; but it focuses on man *as he is,* and *as he ought to be,* as its unique and appropriate theme. It is not a treatise on man as he was, nor on man as he will be, but on man as he is, and as he ought to be; not as he is physically, astronomically, geologically, politically, or metaphysically; but as he is and ought to be *morally* and *religiously*.

The words of the Bible contain all the ideas within it;—these words, when rightly understood, make the ideas clear. The words and sentences of the Bible should be translated, interpreted, and understood according to the same principles and rules of interpretation used for other ancient writings; for when God spoke to man in his own language, he spoke as one person converses with another, using clear, agreed-upon meanings of the terms. This is essential to its character as a revelation from God; otherwise, it would not be a revelation, but would always require a class of inspired individuals to explain and reveal its true meaning to humanity.

We have written frequently and extensively on the principles and rules of interpretation, as they are essential and useful in this generation of ongoing mystification and allegorizing. From our previous writings, we will here only extract the basic rules of interpretation, derived from extensive and well-organized premises; fully supported, too, by the leading translators and most distinguished critics and commentators of the last and present century.

**Rule 1**. When opening any book in the sacred Scriptures, *first consider the historical circumstances of the book. These include the order, the title, the author, the date, the place, and the occasion of it*.

The *order* in historical writings is very important; for example,—whether it is the first, second, or third of the five books of Moses, or any other series of narratives, or even letters.

The *title* is also important, as it sometimes expresses the *purpose* of the book. For example, *Exodus*—the departure of Israel from Egypt; *Acts of Apostles*, etc.

The unique characteristics of the *author*—the time in which he lived—his style—mode of expression, illustrate his writings. The date, place, and occasion of it are obviously necessary for a correct application of anything in the book.

**Rule 2**. In examining the contents of any book, regarding precepts, promises, exhortations, etc. *observe who is speaking, and under what dispensation he is acting*. Is he a Patriarch, a Jew, or a Christian? *Also consider the people addressed; their prejudices, characters, and religious relationships*. Are they Jews or Christians—believers or non-believers—approved or disapproved? This rule is essential for the proper application of every command, promise, warning, admonition, or exhortation, in the Old Testament or New.

**Rule 3**. To understand the meaning of what is commanded, promised, taught, etc. *the same linguistic principles, derived from the nature of language; or the same laws of interpretation that are applied to the language of other books, should be applied to the language of the Bible*.

**Rule 4**. *Common usage, which can only be determined by evidence, must always decide the meaning of any word that has only one meaning*;—but when words have, according to evidence (i.e., the dictionary), more than one meaning, whether literal or figurative, *the context, the scope, or parallel passages must determine the meaning*: for if common usage, the writer's intent, the context, and parallel passages fail, there can be no certainty in the interpretation of language.

**Rule 5**. *In all figurative language, identify the point of resemblance, and judge the nature of the figure and its type from that point of resemblance*.

**Rule 6**. In interpreting symbols, types, allegories, and parables, this rule is paramount: *identify the point to be illustrated; for comparison should never extend beyond that point—to all the attributes, qualities, or circumstances of the symbol, type, allegory, or parable*.

**Rule 7**. For the beneficial and sanctifying understanding of the Oracles of God, the following rule is essential—

*We must come within the understanding distance*.

There is a distance that is properly called *the speaking distance*, or the *hearing distance*; beyond which the voice does not reach, and the ear does not hear. To hear another, we must come within that circle which the voice fills audibly.

Now we can properly say that, as it relates to God, there is an understanding distance. All beyond that distance cannot understand God; all within it can easily understand him in all matters of piety and morality. God himself is the center of that circle, and humility is its boundary.

The wisdom of God is as evident in adapting the light of the Sun of Righteousness to our spiritual or moral vision as in adjusting the light of day to our eyes. The light reaches us without any effort on our part; but we must open our eyes, and if our eyes are sound, we enjoy the natural light of heaven. There is a sound eye in relation to spiritual light, just as there is in relation to material light. Now, while the linguistic principles and rules of interpretation enable many people to be skilled in biblical criticism and in interpreting words and sentences; those who neither perceive nor appreciate the *things* represented by those words; the sound eye contemplates the things themselves and is captivated by the moral scenes that the Bible reveals.

The moral *soundness* of vision consists in having the eyes of understanding focused solely on God himself, his approval and loving affection for us. It is sometimes called a *single* eye because it looks for one thing above all else. Therefore, everyone who opens the Book of God with *one aim*, with one passionate desire—intent only on knowing the will of God; for such a person, the knowledge of God is easy: for the Bible is designed to illuminate such individuals, and only such, with the beneficial knowledge of celestial and divine matters.

Humility of mind, or what is essentially the same, contempt for all earthly superiority, prepares the mind for receiving this light; or, what is virtually the same, opens the ears to hear the voice of God. Amidst the noise of all the arguments from the flesh, the world, and Satan, a person can be so deaf that he cannot hear the still small voice of God's love. But by moving away from pride, greed, and false ambition; from the love of the world; and by coming within that circle, the boundary of which is genuine humility, and the center of which is God himself—the voice of God is distinctly heard and clearly understood. All within this circle are taught by God; all outside it are under the influence of the wicked one. 'God resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble.'

Therefore, anyone who wishes to interpret the Oracles of God for the salvation of his soul must approach this volume with the humility and teachability of a child, and meditate on it day and night. Like Mary, he must sit at the Master's feet and listen to the words that fall from his lips. For such a person, there is an assurance of understanding, a certainty of knowledge, that the learned man alone never attains, and which the mere critic never experiences.

The Bible is a book of facts, not of opinions, theories, abstract generalities, or verbal definitions. It is a book of profound facts, grand and sublime beyond description. These facts reveal God and man, and contain within them the reasons for all piety and righteousness; or what is commonly referred to as religion and morality. The meaning of the Bible's facts is the true biblical doctrine. History is therefore the framework pursued in both Testaments; for testimony primarily relates to faith, and reasoning relates to understanding. History has, we say, to do with facts—and religion springs from them. Hence, the history of the past and the anticipations of the future, or what are usually called history and prophecy, make up exactly four-fifths of all the volumes of inspiration.

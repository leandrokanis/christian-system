# 19. Christians are Persons Pardoned, Justified, Sanctified, Adopted, and Saved

While clarifying the most important terms and phrases in the Christian faith for a clearer and more comprehensive understanding, it is important that we also consider other characteristics of a genuine Christian. The five terms at the beginning of this chapter all indicate his *state*; and do not include any attributes of his *character*.

These characteristics are various aspects of a new state in relation to an old one; or they represent the gospel as affecting humanity's position in the universe in all the ways sin has impacted him. Was he guilty, condemned, unholy, alien, and lost in Adam the first? In Adam the second, he is in a completely opposite state;—he is pardoned where he was guilty—justified where he was condemned—sanctified where he was unholy—adopted where he was alien—and saved where he was lost. Sin, then, condemns, pollutes, alienates, and destroys its subjects. Grace justifies, sanctifies, adopts, and saves its subjects in relation to these points. Pardon relates to guilt; justification relates to condemnation; sanctification relates to pollution; adoption relates to alienation; and salvation relates to destruction. Those *out of Christ* are, then, in their sins, condemned, unholy, alien, and lost; while those *in Christ* are pardoned, justified, sanctified, adopted into the family of God, and saved.

In previous dispensations, and in the present, two things are unchanging regarding the preparation for a change of state, while the act by which that change is formally completed is not necessarily unchanging. Thus, regarding actual transgression, faith and repentance, in all religious dispensations, were necessary for forgiveness, justification, sanctification, adoption, and salvation. In short, God cannot forgive an unrepentant and unbelieving transgressor. But whether this or that act shall complete a change of state, concerning humanity's relations to the moral universe; whether that act shall be circumcision, animal sacrifice, baptism, confession, prayer, etc., is not from any necessity, either in the divine or human nature, unchanging. It has been changed; but faith in God's provisions, and repentance for past transgressions, are now, always have been, and always will be, necessary for forgiveness.

The reason for this is that faith and repentance change the state of a person's heart toward God; and if there were no universe beyond God and the sinner, all further acts regarding it would be unnecessary. However, concerning the condition of sinners in the universe, and their views, affections, relations, and manner of life, more than faith and repentance, or a change of views and feelings, is necessary for actual, tangible, and formal pardon, justification, sanctification, adoption, and the salvation of the soul from sin. Hence came the practices of baptism, confession, prayer, fasting, and intercession.

It is wise and kind on the part of Heaven to ordain such acts, or to establish such ordinances that will assure ourselves and others of our new relations; and to base our *enjoyment* of the favor and love of God, not merely on faith and repentance, or any other mental operation; but on certain clear, overt acts, such as baptism, confession, prayer, etc., which affect ourselves and others much more than they can possibly affect God himself; being the fruit of our faith, or perhaps, rather, only the fulfillment of our faith in the promises of God.

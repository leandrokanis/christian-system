# 10. Sacrifice for Sin

The history of sacrifice is the history of atonement, reconciliation, redemption, and forgiveness of sins. These are not, at least in the Jewish and Christian traditions, exactly synonymous terms. Sacrifice atones and reconciles. It appeases God and reconciles humanity. It is the cause, and these are its effects on heaven and earth, on God and humanity.

For clarity, four questions should be posed and answered at the very beginning of our inquiries. 1. What *is* sacrifice? 2. *To whom* is it to be offered? 3. *For whom* is it to be offered? 4. *By whom* is it to be offered? The answers are as straightforward and brief as the questions. 1. In its literal primary sense, it is "*the solemn and religious infliction of death upon an innocent and unoffending victim, usually by shedding its blood.*" Figuratively, it means the offering of anything, living or dead, person or animal, or property, to God. 2. Religious sacrifice is to be offered to God alone. 3. It is to be offered for humanity. 4. It is to be offered by a priest.

The majority of sacrifices were lambs. Hence Christ is called the **Lamb of God**, not because of his innocence or patience, but because "he takes away," or bears "the sin of the world." It is more in reference to his *death* than to his *life* that he is called the *Lamb* of God. Neither his *example* nor his *teaching* could atone for sin. This required the shedding of blood: for without the shedding of blood, there has never been forgiveness of sin.

Priests are mediators in their proper place and meaning. But initially, every person was their own priest. Just as it was once acceptable for a man to marry his sister because he could find no other wife, it was lawful and practical for every person to be their own priest. Thus, Adam, Abel, Noah, etc. were their own priests. In the next phase of history, the eldest sons — then the leaders of tribes — became priests for their respective tribes and people. Ultimately, God called and appointed individuals like Melchizedek and Aaron to those offices.

Sacrifice, without a doubt, is as old as the Fall. The institution of it is not recorded by Moses. But he informs us that God had regard for Abel's offering and accepted from him a *slain lamb.* Had it been a human institution, this could not have been the case, for a divine mandate has always been essential to any acceptable worship. The question, "Who has required this at your hands?" must always be answered with a "*Thus says the Lord,*" before an offering of humanity can be acknowledged by the Lawgiver of the universe. "In vain," said the Great Teacher, "do you worship God, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men." God accepted the sacrifices of Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, etc., and in the Jewish system provided many laws and regulations concerning it.

Now, as sacrifice may be viewed in different aspects, in relation to what it is in itself, to whom it is offered, for whom and by whom it is offered; so in each of these contexts, it may be represented under different names. Hence, it is a "*sin offering,*" a *thank offering*, a *propitiation,* [1] a *reconciliation*, a *redemption*. Viewed in relation to God, it is a propitiation; in relation to humanity, it is a reconciliation; and from another perspective, it may even be regarded as a redemption or ransom. It may be helpful to make a few remarks on each of these.

Sacrifice, as it relates to *God*, is a *propitiation*; as it relates to *sinners*, it is a *reconciliation*; as it relates to *sin*, it is an *expiation*; as it relates to the *saved*, it is a *redemption*. These are aspects of great importance in understanding the Scriptures. As a *propitiation* or atonement [2], it is offered to God; not, indeed, to move his benevolence or to stir his mercy, but to render him favorable *according to law and justice.* It arises from everlasting love and is the *effect* and not the *cause* of God's benevolence toward sinners. But without it, God could not be favorable to us. The indignity offered to his person, authority, and governance by humanity's rebellion, as well as the well-being of all his creatures, made it impossible for him, according to justice, eternal right, and his own benevolence, to show mercy without sacrifice. True, he always prefers mercy to sacrifice, as he prefers the end to the means. But divine mercy forever rests upon the propitiatory; upon law and justice. Thus, Paul affirms of Jesus, "Whom God has set forth as a *propitiation* through faith in his blood, for a declaration of his justice — that *he might be just,* and *the justifier of the ungodly,* or of anyone who believes in Jesus." In this sense only, God could not be gracious to humanity in forgiving them without a propitiation, or something that could justify him both to himself and all creatures. In this understanding of the term *atonement*, it is found often in the law, no less than twenty-five times in the single book of Leviticus.

As for the sinner, we have said it is a *reconciliation*. Indeed, the term reconciliation very appropriately applies to sacrifice, as it brings together the offended and the offender. Insofar as it honors law and justice, it reconciles God to forgive; and insofar as it reveals to the offender love and mercy, it reconciles him to his offended Sovereign. In this view, it is indeed a reconciliation. It appeases God and reconciles humanity. God's "anger is turned away;" (not a turbulent passion, not an unyielding wrath); but "*that moral sentiment and justice,*" which demands the punishment of the violated law, is pacified or well pleased; and humanity's hatred and animosity against God are subdued, overcome, and destroyed in and by the same sacrifice. Thus, in fact, it is, in reference to both parties, a reconciliation. Still, however, when we speak according to scriptural usage, and with proper distinction, sacrifice, as it relates to God, is atonement or propitiation, and as it relates to humanity, it is reconciliation. These are its reasons and its effects. "For this reason," says Paul, "Jesus is the mediator of a new covenant, that *by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions* under the first covenant, those who have been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance." [3] Again, the same writer makes the death of Christ the basis of reconciliation, saying, "Be reconciled to God: for he has made Christ a sin offering for us;" and now "God is in Christ, reconciling the world to himself." [4]

As for sin, it has been noted that sacrifice is an *expiation*. The terms purification or cleansing are preferred in common translations over *expiation*. Once, at least (Num 35:33), we need a better word to represent the original than the term *cleansing*. "There can be no expiation for the land" polluted with blood, "but by the blood of him that shed it." Still, if anyone prefers *purification* to expiation, or even *cleansing* to either, as long as we understand each other, it is indeed a matter of easy forbearance. The main point is that sacrifice cancels sin, atones for sin, and removes it. "*He put away sin,*" says Paul, "*by the sacrifice of himself.*" This is expiation.

"The redemption, then, which is in Christ Jesus," is a *moral*, and not a *commercial* consideration. If sin were only a *debt*, and not a *crime*, it might be forgiven without atonement. Indeed, if sin were a debt, and sacrifice a payment of that debt, then there could be no forgiveness at all with God! For if the Redeemer or Ransomer of humanity has paid the debt, justice, and not mercy or forgiveness, commands the *release*, not the *pardon* of the debtor. Some, however, due to a misunderstanding of sacred language and the meaning of biblical terms, have actually represented the death of Christ more as the payment of a huge debt than as an expiation of sin or a purification from guilt, and have thus made the pardon of sin entirely unintelligible, or rather, indeed, impossible. Everyone understands that when a third person assumes a debt and pays it, the principal must be discharged and cannot be forgiven. But when sin is viewed as a crime, and atonement is offered by a third person, then it becomes a question of grace whether the pardon or acquittal of the sinner shall be granted by the one against whom the crime has been committed; because, even after an atonement or propitiation is made, the transgressor is still as deserving of punishment as before. There is room, then, for both justice and mercy; for the display of indignation against sin, and the forgiveness of the sinner, in proper views of sin, and of the redemption there is in and through the Lord Jesus Christ.

Redemption, however, is the *deliverance from sin*, rather than the expiation or atonement for it. Thus, Christ is said "by his own blood, to have obtained an eternal redemption for us." [5] Thus pardon, sanctification, and even the resurrection of the bodies of the saints, are each considered as parts of our redemption, or deliverance from guilt to sin, from the power of sin, and from the punishment of sin. [6]

There are a number of inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the debate about the nature and extent of the atonement, which, as the morning mist retreats from the hills before the rising sun, disappear from our mental horizon when the light of scriptural definition breaks upon our souls. The atonement or propitiation has no "*extent,*" because God alone is its object. It considers sin as a unit in the divine governance, and therefore the "*Lamb of God* bears away the sin of the world," and his death is a "*sin offering.*" As for its value, it is beyond words. It is indeed commensurate with the sin of the world; for it makes it just on God's part to forgive and save everyone who believes in Jesus. Reconciliation and redemption, however, have a certain limited extent. Reconciliation is not universal, but partial. Not everyone believes in Jesus, and therefore not all are reconciled to God through him. Redemption, or deliverance from the guilt, pollution, power, and punishment of sin, is only commensurate with the elect of God, i.e., with those who believe in Jesus and obey him.
They who claim that one drop of Christ's blood could cover the sin of the whole world unknowingly teach that Christ died in vain. Surely, the Messiah could have shed many drops of blood and still have lived. Those who reason this way make his death meaningless and unnecessary. They also unintentionally align with those who see sin merely as a debt, not as a crime, and therefore argue that there is no need for sin offerings, sacrifice, or a divine Savior for forgiveness.

They seem to misunderstand the issue, and I regret to see names like Butler, Whitby, and Macknight among them. While they argue that Christ's death was a sacrifice or a propitiation for sin, they entirely attribute its effectiveness to God's mere appointment. According to them, God could have saved the entire world without sending His Son: the merits or effectiveness of Christ's death come not from His dignity but from God's will alone! We cannot believe that it was possible for God to save sinners in any other way than He has chosen: to have paid an excessive price for our redemption would suggest extravagance rather than divine wisdom and prudence. If mere appointment were sufficient, why not have continued the legal sacrifices and made the blood of bulls and goats effective for forgiveness?

In conclusion, sacrifice is essential for the remission of sins and has existed since the fall of man. However, the sacrifices of the patriarchal and Jewish eras could not and did not take away sin. They were merely types of the real sacrifice: as Paul says, "It was not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sin." And again, "If the blood of bulls and goats, along with the ashes of a heifer, could cleanse for the purification of the flesh, how much more shall *the blood of Christ,* who through the eternal Spirit offers Himself to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" Therefore, Christ's death is a real and sufficient sacrifice for sin, serving as *propitiation, reconciliation, expiation,* and *redemption*; from which flow justification, sanctification, adoption, and eternal life.

The sacrifice of Christ, as previously stated, is, in relation to God, a propitiation; in relation to man, a reconciliation; in relation to sin, an expiation; and in relation to the penitent, a redemption. However, the attributes that apply to it in any of these aspects do not apply to it in the others; and this oversight has, in our opinion, been the source of endless controversies regarding the "atonement," as it is most commonly called. It is indeed *infinite* in value concerning the expiation of sin or its propitiatory power; but regarding the actual reconciliation and redemption of sinners, it is limited to those who believe in and obey the Savior. While it is as universal as the sin of the world, only the specific sins of the obedient are expiated by it. Its *design*, then, is necessarily limited to all who come to God through it; while its value and effectiveness are equal to the salvation of the whole world, provided they place themselves under the covering of its propitiatory power.

The "doctrine of the cross" is the central doctrine of the Bible and the very essence of Christianity — it explains all the peculiarities of the Christian system and the relationship of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as far as humans can comprehend them. It has been, for skeptics and many believers, "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense." For the sake of some of the speculative and critical who ask *why are these things so,* I include an excerpt from Mr. Watson's writings on this point, which may offer them some useful reflections on this crucial and all-consuming subject: — "How sin may be forgiven,” says Mr. Watson, “without leading to misconceptions of the divine character that would encourage disobedience and weaken the influence of divine governance, must be considered a very difficult problem. A government that allowed no forgiveness would plunge the guilty into despair; a government that never punishes offenses is a contradiction and cannot exist. Not punishing the guilty dissolves authority; punishing without mercy destroys, and where all are guilty, leads to universal destruction. That we cannot sin without consequences is a settled matter. The Ruler of the world is not indifferent to the actions of His creatures; the fact that penal consequences are attached to offenses is not a matter of debate but is evident from daily observations of life. It is already established that God's authority must be preserved; however, it should be noted that in the kind of administration that restrains evil through penalties and encourages obedience through favor and hope, we and all moral beings are the interested parties, not the Divine Governor Himself, whom, due to His independent and all-sufficient nature, our transgressions cannot harm. The reasons compelling Him to maintain His authority do not end with Himself. If He treats offenders harshly, it is for our sake and for the sake of the moral order of the universe, which sin, if encouraged by negligence or frequent impunity, would lead to endless disorder and misery. If the granting of pardon for offenses is strongly and even severely guarded, so that no less satisfaction could be accepted than the death of God's own Son, we must refer to the moral necessity of the situation, arising from the general welfare of accountable beings susceptible to the deep evil of sin, and not to any reluctance on the part of our Creator to forgive, much less to anything vindictive in His nature — charges that have been most thoughtlessly and unfairly said to be implied in the doctrine of Christ's sacrificial sufferings. If it is true that the release of offending humans from future punishment and their restoration to divine favor should, for the interest of humanity and for the instruction and caution of other beings, be granted in such a way that no license is given to offenses; that God Himself, while showing compassion, should not appear less just or less holy than He truly is; that His authority should be felt as compelling, and that disobedience should truly, though not unconditionally, subject us to the deserved penalty, as if no hope of forgiveness had been offered — we ask, on what scheme, except that which is revealed in the New Testament, are those necessary conditions provided? They are necessary unless we advocate for a license and impunity that would nullify all good governance in the universe, a position no reasonable person would support. If so, we must acknowledge that there is strong internal evidence for the truth of Scripture's doctrine when it states that the offer of pardon is contingent only upon the securities we have mentioned. If it is said that sin may be pardoned through the exercise of divine prerogative, the response is that if this prerogative were exercised toward only part of humanity, the passing by of the rest would be difficult to reconcile with the Divine character; and if the benefit were extended to all, governance would cease to exist. This approach of bringing people under the exercise of a merciful prerogative does not address the obvious difficulty of the situation; nor is it improved by limiting the act of grace only to repentant offenders. For if repentance implies a "renewal in the spirit of the mind," no offender would naturally repent in that way. But if repentance merely means remorse and fear in the face of danger, what offender, surrounded by the wreckage of past pleasures, feeling the emptiness of guilty pleasures now lost forever, and seeing the approach of delayed punishment, would not repent? If the principle of granting pardon for repentance governed human systems, every criminal would escape, and judicial processes would become a joke. Nor is it recognized by the Divine Being in His dealings with humans in the present state, even though in this world punishments are not final and absolute. Repentance does not restore health damaged by excess; property wasted by extravagance; or character once tarnished by dishonorable actions. If repentance alone could secure pardon, then everyone must be pardoned, and governance would dissolve, as in the case of forgiveness through mere prerogative; but if an arbitrary selection is made, then different and conflicting principles of governance are introduced into divine administration, which is a derogatory assumption.

The question posed abstractly, How can mercy be extended to offending creatures, subjects of divine governance, without encouraging vice by undermining the righteous and holy character of God and the authority of His governance, in which the entire universe of beings has a stake? is, therefore, one of the most important and challenging that can engage the human mind. None of the theories opposed to Christianity provides a satisfactory solution to the problem. They assume principles that either destroy moral governance or cannot be applied in the circumstances of humanity. The only answer is found in the holy Scriptures. They alone show, and indeed, they alone claim to show, how God can be "just," and yet the "justifier" of the ungodly. Other schemes demonstrate how He may be merciful; but the difficulty does not lie there. The gospel addresses it by declaring "the righteousness of God," while also proclaiming His mercy. The voluntary sufferings of the divine Son of God, "for us," "the just for the unjust," magnify God's justice; display His hatred for sin; proclaim "the exceeding sinfulness" of transgression through the deep and painful manner in which they were inflicted upon the Substitute; warn the persistent offender of the severity and certainty of punishment; and open the gates of salvation to every penitent. It is also part of the same divine plan to engage the influence of the Holy Spirit to awaken repentance in humanity and lead the wayward back to Himself; to renew our fallen nature in righteousness at the moment we are justified through faith, and to place us in circumstances where we may henceforth "walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." All the goals of governance are fulfilled here — no license is given to offense — the moral law remains intact — a day of judgment is still appointed — future and eternal judgments still display their terrible consequences — a new and unique display of the divine character's purity is provided — yet pardon is offered to all who seek it; and the whole world may be saved.
With such evidence of its suitability for humanity, and such high views of its connection with the principles and purposes of moral governance, the doctrine of atonement presents itself. However, other important considerations highlight the combined wisdom and goodness of the method of extending mercy to the guilty that Christianity teaches us has been exclusively adopted. It is indeed made "worthy of all acceptance" by the fact that it addresses the difficulties we have just discussed—difficulties that would otherwise leave a gloomy impression on every offender who becomes aware of their spiritual danger. Yet, it must be considered very inattentively if it does not further commend itself to us by not only alleviating the fears we might have regarding the severity of the Divine Lawgiver but also by elevating Him in our esteem as "the righteous Lord, who loves righteousness." He surrendered His beloved Son to suffering and death so that the influence of moral goodness would not be weakened in the hearts of His creatures. As a God of love, this instance reveals the tenderness and kindness of His nature, infinitely more impressive and moving than any abstract description could convey or any act of creative or providential power and grace could exhibit. Therefore, it is most suitable to subdue the enmity that has unnaturally developed in the hearts of His creatures, which, when corrupted, they easily transfer from a law that restrains their inclinations to the Lawgiver Himself. If it is important for us to understand the extent and reality of our danger, the death of Christ displays it, not in description, but in the most powerful action. If it is important for us to have assurance of God's willingness to forgive us, it receives a demonstration that cannot be surpassed. If gratitude is the most powerful motivation for future obedience, making commands on one side and active service on the other "not burdensome, but joyful," the remembrance of the obligations that the "love of Christ" has placed upon us is a constant source of this energetic affection and will elevate it to higher and more joyful activity forever. All that can most powerfully illustrate the combined tenderness and awe-inspiring majesty of God, and the repulsiveness of sin; all that can win back the heart of humanity to its Creator and Lord, making future obedience a matter of love and joy, as well as duty; all that can extinguish the angry and harmful passions of one person toward another; all that can inspire mutual kindness and encourage selfless charity for the benefit of others; all that can awaken hope or bring peace through faith is found in the sacrificial death of Christ and the principles and purposes for which it was endured.

<sup>1: The Hebrew term translated in the Greek Old Testament as *ilasmos*, and in the common English version as *atonement* or propitiation, is *copher*, which means a *covering*. The verb **COPHER** "to *cover,*" or "to *make atonement*" denotes the object of sacrifice; hence, Jesus is called the *ilasmos*, the covering, propitiation, or atonement for our sins. 1 Jn 2:2; 1 Jn 4:10. It is a curious and remarkable fact that God covered Adam and Eve with the skins of the first victims of death, instead of their *fig leaf* garments. This may have foreshadowed the fact that while sin was atoned for or expiated concerning God by the life of the victim, the effect concerning humanity was a covering for their nakedness and shame, or their sin, which stripped them of their original innocence and beauty and covered them with disgrace and reproach.</sup>

<sup>2: *Kattallagee*, translated once as *atonement*; Rom. 5:11, occurs in the New Testament *four times*. In Rom. 5:11, it should have been *reconciliation*, as in Rom. 11:15, 2 Co 5:18-19. It is not *ilasmos, atonement*, in the Jewish sense, but *katallagee, reconciliation*. God receives the atonement, and humanity receives the reconciliation. It is unreasonable, then, to discuss the extent of the atonement, but not so regarding the reconciliation.</sup>

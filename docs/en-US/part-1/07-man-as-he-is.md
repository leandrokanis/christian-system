# 7. Man as He Is

"God made man upright, but they have sought out many inventions." Adam rebelled. The natural man became preternatural. The animal triumphed over the human elements of his nature. Sin was born on earth. The crown fell from his head. The glory of the Lord departed from him. He felt his guilt and trembled; he saw his nakedness and blushed. The bright candle of the Lord became a dimly smoking wick. He was led to judgment. He was tried, condemned to death, stripped of his inheritance, but spared from immediate execution. A prisoner of death, but allowed to roam freely until the King authorized his capture and destruction.

The stream of humanity, thus contaminated at its source, cannot in this world ever rise on its own to its original purity and excellence. We all inherit a fragile constitution, physically, intellectually, but especially morally weak and flawed. We have all inherited our father's constitution and fortune: for Adam, we are told, after he fell "*begat a son in his own image,*" and that son was just as flawed as any other son ever born into the world: for he murdered his own dear brother because he was a better man than himself. "Thus, by one man sin entered into the world, and death by that one sin, and so death, the wages of sin, has fallen upon all the offspring of Adam," because in him they have all sinned, or been made mortal — and consequently are born under condemnation to that death which fell upon our common ancestor because of his transgression.

In Adam, all have sinned; therefore "in Adam all die." Your nature, dear reader, not your person, was in Adam when he reached out to break the command of God. You did not personally sin in that act; but your nature, then in the person of your father, sinned against the Author of your existence. In the just judgment, therefore, of your heavenly Father, your nature sinned in Adam, and with him it is right that all human beings should be born *mortal,* and that death should reign over the whole race as it has done in countless instances even "over them that have not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression;" i.e., by violating a positive law. Now it must be acknowledged that what God can righteously and mercifully inflict upon a part of mankind, he may justly and mercifully inflict upon all; and therefore those who live twenty or eighty years on this earth, for the sin of their nature in Adam, might have been extinguished the first year as reasonably as those who have perished in perfect infancy. Death is explicitly called by an Apostle, "*the wages of sin.*" Now this reward of sin is currently inflicted upon at least *one fourth* of the human race who have never violated any law or sinned personally by any act of their lives. According to the most accurate mortality statistics, from one third to one fourth of the entire human progeny die in infancy, under two years, without the awareness of good or evil. They are thus, innocent though they be, regarding actual and personal transgression, considered as sinners by him who inflicts upon them the specific and appropriate wages of sin. This alarming and profoundly significant fact in human history proves that Adam was not only the common father but the actual representative of all his children.

There is, therefore, a sin of our nature as well as personal transgression. Some inappropriately call the sin of our nature our "original sin;" as if the sin of Adam was the personal offense of his children. True, indeed, our nature was corrupted by the fall of Adam before it was passed down to us; and hence that hereditary weakness to do good, and that tendency to do evil, so universally evident in all human beings. Let no one speak against the transmission of a moral defect until they satisfactorily explain the fact — that the specific vices of parents appear in their children as clearly as the color of their skin, their hair, or the shape of their faces. A disease in the moral constitution of a person is as clearly transmissible as any physical trait, if there is any truth in history, biography, or human observation.

Still, man, with all his hereditary weakness, is not under an unavoidable necessity to sin. Greatly prone to evil, easily tempted into transgression, he may or may not yield to passion and temptation. Hence the differences we often observe in the corruption and depravity of man. All inherit a *fallen,* consequently a *sinful* nature; though not all are equally depraved. Thus we find that the degrees of sinfulness and depravity vary significantly among different individuals. And although without the knowledge of God and his revealed will, without the intercession of a mediator, and without faith in him, "it is impossible to please God;" still, there are those who, while lacking knowledge and belief, are more noble and virtuous than others. Thus Luke acknowledges when he says, "The Jews in Berea were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily whether these things were so. Therefore, many of them believed." Acts 17:11. But until man in his current fallen state believes the gospel message of his sins and submits to Jesus Christ as the only Mediator and Savior of sinners, it is impossible for him to do anything that is truly pleasing or acceptable to God.

Condemned to natural death, and greatly fallen and depraved in our entire moral constitution though we certainly are, as a result of the sin of Adam; still, because of the intervention of the second Adam, none are punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, but those who actually and voluntarily sin against a dispensation of mercy under which they are placed: for this is "the condemnation of the world, that light has come into the world, and men *choose darkness* rather than light, because their deeds are evil."

# 27. Expediency

"All things lawful are not expedient, because all things lawful do not build up." So Paul essentially affirmed. This is a position that could lead to licentiousness if not properly qualified. As defined by its author, it is perfectly safe. He only assumed that there were many things he could lawfully do that were not *expedient* for him to do. He might, for example, have married a wife, eaten the flesh of either Jewish or pagan sacrifices, or drunk the wine of their libations, etc., according to Christian law; but given the circumstances of his unique vocation and locations, doing these things would have been inexpedient.

Law itself is, indeed, at best just an expedient — a means that was considered suitable for some rational end at the time it was established. However, due to the changing nature of things, laws often fail to be the best means to the proposed ends; and are therefore abolished or temporarily suspended. This is true of all laws and institutions that prescribe the *modes* and *forms* of action, whether in religion or morality. Moral laws, properly speaking, are indeed immutable; because the principle of every moral law is *love,* which can never cease to be not only a way and means, but the *only way and means,* to rational, human happiness. Positive precepts, however, that prescribe the *forms* of religious and moral action, coming from God himself, have been changed and may be changed again, while all the elements of piety and morality remain immutable. For example, it would now be immoral to marry a biological sister; yet it was done for a time by divine authority. It became inexpedient to continue the practice, and the law was changed.

There is, therefore, *a law of expediency,* as well as the expediency of law. This law of expediency, which is indeed the basis of the expediency of law in divine governance, has occasionally been elevated above the precepts that prescribe the forms of religious and moral action, as in the case of David eating the loaves of the presence and the priests profaning the Sabbath by their work in the Temple. It is true that such cases are exceedingly rare; and it is rare for those who can safely decide when any particular precept prescribing the *form* of action may be waived or suspended for the sake of the action itself. Moreover, it is highly questionable whether, under the more perfect institution of Christianity, the law of expediency can ever conflict with any moral or religious precept in the New Covenant.

Still, there are many things left to the law of expediency, concerning which no precepts are found in the apostolic writings. To determine these is the purpose of this chapter. They are, in one sentence, those things or forms of action that it was impossible or unnecessary to reduce to specific precepts; consequently, they are not faith, piety, or morality; because whatever pertains to the faith, worship, or morality of Christianity was both possible and necessary to be proclaimed; and is explicitly and fully stated in the sacred scriptures. The laws of expediency, therefore, have no place in determining the articles of faith, acts of worship, or principles of morality. All these require a "*thus saith the Lord*" in explicit statements, and the sacred writings have clearly defined and decided them. But in other matters that may be called the circumstantial aspects of the gospel and the church of Christ, the people of God are left to their own discretion and to the needs and circumstances of society.

Many things, indeed, that are vital to the well-being and prosperity of the kingdom of Christ are left to the law of expediency. A few examples will suffice: — Can anyone imagine a measure of greater importance than the preservation of the apostolic writings, the multiplication of copies, their translation into different languages, and the method of distributing them throughout the world? Now, who can show a positive or specific precept on any one of these four vital points? Scribes or copyists, paper-makers, printers, book-binders, and vendors of the oracles of God are as unknown to the apostolic writers as are mails, post offices, railroads, and steam engines. The kingdom of Christ has been so negligent on some of these points that it does not currently have a *received copy* of the Living Oracles. We American and English people have a *received version* by the authority of a king; but we do not have a **received original** by the authority of any king or civil or ecclesiastical government. A startling fact, indeed! But who dares to deny it?

Next to these are meeting houses, baptisteries, Lord's tables, the symbolic loaf and cup, times of gathering, arrangements for the day, etc. Acts of Parliament, decrees of synods and councils, but no apostolic enactments, statutes, or laws, are found for any of these important items. There is neither precept nor precedent in the New Testament for building, renting, buying, or owning a meeting house; for erecting a baptismal basin, font, or bath; for chancel, altar, table, leavened or unleavened bread, chalice, cup, or tankard, and many other things of equal value.

There is no law, rule, or precedent for the *manner* of eating the Lord's Supper, no indication of the quantity of bread and wine to be used by each participant; nothing is said about who shall partake first, or how it shall be passed from one to another. These are all discretionary matters, left to the prudence and good sense of Christian communities — in other words, to the law of expediency.

Regarding these and many other similar matters, nothing is enacted, prescribed, or decided by apostolic authority; but all the things to be done are enjoined in very clear and broad precepts, or in very striking and clear apostolic precedents. General laws and precepts, encompassing the entire range of religious and moral action, are often found in the sayings of the Lord and his ministers of the New Institution, from which our duties and obligations can also be clearly determined. That "marriage is honorable in all" is clearly taught; but who has ever read a verse on the *manner* in which the most important of all social institutions is to be performed? No age is fixed at which the covenant shall be made or ratified — no time of life prescribed for its consummation — nothing said about who shall perform the service, the formula, the witnesses, the record, etc. And, even more strangely, there is no table, law, or statute in all the New Covenant stating who may or may not enter into that relationship based on any principle of consanguinity or affinity. By the consent of the Christian church, the Jewish law applies in this matter.

The communion of saints, of all Christian churches — the cooperation of churches as one holy nation, a kingdom of priests, as a peculiar people in all common interests and benefits — an effective gospel ministry, justly and honorably supported by the whole community — are matters clearly and fully taught by both apostolic precept and authority; but the forms, ways, and means by which these ends shall be achieved are left to the law of expediency.

But here arises a practical and crucial question, namely — *Who shall ascertain and who shall interpret this law of expediency?* We all agree that expedients should be chosen with regard to times, seasons, and other circumstances. Changes in these must always change expedients. The mariner's compass, the art of printing, new modes of travel, banks and their commercial operations, new forms of government, etc., have changed the order of society and all human expedients. Now the law of expediency is the law of adopting the best present means of achieving any given end. But this is a matter that the wisdom and good sense of individuals and communities must decide. This is not, and cannot be, a matter of standing revelation. Now if the church were always unanimous in opinion as in faith — if all the accumulated wisdom gave one uniform decision on all such questions, then the whole church would, by one voice, ascertain the law of expediency on any given point. But this is not the case. No group of people — apostles, teachers, or laypersons — has ever agreed on questions of expediency. Paul and Barnabas disagreed and differed, *without any breach of communion,* on such a question. Hence arises the necessity of the spirit of concession, subordination, bearing with one another, and submitting to one another. When there are two views or opinions on any question of expediency held by two parties, one of them must yield, or there will be two distinct systems of operation, and ultimately two distinct parties. According to the law of expediency, then, those who are younger in age, experience, or numbers must give way to those who are older in age, experience, or numbers. But since numbers are assumed to represent the ratios of age, wisdom, and knowledge, it is expedient that a clearly determined majority of those whose responsibility it is to decide any matter shall interpret the law of expediency; or, in other words, the minority shall peacefully and cordially accept the decisions of the majority. Since the age of social compacts began until now, no other principle of cooperation, no other law of expediency, can secure the interests, unity, harmony, and strength of any people, except that of the few submitting to the many.

He who asks for unanimity asks for what is not often attainable in a small number of people. He asks for the liberty of one or two to govern or control an entire community — for the governance of a minority, however small, over a majority, however large. This is virtually, though not formally, and not often intentionally, the demand of all advocates of unanimity in ascertaining or interpreting the law of expediency in any given case. The law of expediency dictates that a majority of the seniors shall decide in all cases what is most expedient to be done in achieving any of the ends commanded in the Christian Institution, the means to which are not divinely ordained in the written laws of that institution; and that the minority shall cheerfully and conscientiously accept such decisions.
*The law of love is the highest law of religion, morality, and practicality. No set of laws, without it, could make or keep any group pure, peaceful, and happy; and with it, we mostly only need general laws.* — This is the spirit, soul, and essence of the Christian faith. We cannot love through law, but we can live in love with no other law than that of love. The Christian system views love as supreme and does not make arrangements or provisions for holding together a carnal, worldly, selfish, self-willed population. It would be better for such a confederacy to break apart into as many pieces as there are individuals, due to the repellent force of selfishness, than to be held together by all the laws of practicality from Noah to John Wesley.

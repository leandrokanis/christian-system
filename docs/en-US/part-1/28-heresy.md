# 28. Heresy

Schisms and heresies are matters strongly condemned in the Christian Scriptures. To guard against them with due care, we must contemplate and understand their true and proper scriptural attributes. Therefore, we will first attempt to define them.

The term *schism* appears only *eight* times in the apostolic writings. When applied to a garment, as in Matt. 9:16 and Mark 2:21, it is properly translated *rent*; when applied to a group of people, as in John 7:43, 9:16, and 10:19, it is translated *division*; when applied to the church by Paul, in 1 Cor. 1:10, 11:18, and 12:25, it denotes *division* or *alienation* — not due to faith, doctrines, or opinions — but because of individuals as leaders or heads among the brethren. The contexts in which it is found always indicate this. It is a division concerning *internal union,* or the union of heart and affection, which only tends to a breach of visible or outward union, and is therefore condemned by the Apostle. Such are its New Testament meanings.

Schisms can exist even when there is perfect agreement in faith, doctrine, and all religious beliefs. An undue attachment to certain individuals, to the detriment of others, and partial regard based on personal preferences are the true elements of schism or division as it appeared in Corinth, and as the term is used in the New Testament. Few people today can accurately appreciate the force of the word *schisms* in the apostolic age, because very few have experienced the intimacies and oneness of heart and soul that existed in the Christian profession when it was genuine and uncorrupted. A union formed on Christian principles — a union with Christ and his people, in views, sentiments, feelings, aims, and pursuits — a real partnership for eternity, almost erased individuality itself, and inseparably bonded all the genuine members of Christ's body into one spirit. Kindred souls mingle more readily into one mass than the souls of early Christians flowed together in all their aspirations, loves, delights, and interests. Hence arose the jealousy in the Apostle Paul when he first learned that certain individuals in Corinth began to attract attention and loyalty for mere personal, individual, and fleshly reasons, as leaders or heads in the Christian community. In these signs, he already saw the dissolution of the church. Although it was still one visible community, having one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one table, and one supreme and all-controlling interest, he saw not only a real division or breach in the hearts of the people but also foresaw that it would lead to actual, visible disunion or heresy. This brings us to examine the scriptural meaning of the word *heresy.*

*Hairesis,* strictly and literally meaning *choice* or *option,* is anglicized as *heresy,* and is properly rendered as *sect* or *faction,* and by implication, *discord* and *contention.* It appears only *nine* times in the New Testament. In Acts 5:17, it is rendered "the sect of the Sadducees;" in Acts 15:5, "the sect of the Pharisees;" in Acts 24:5, "the sect of the Nazarenes;" in Acts 24:14, Paul says, "after the way which they call *heresy* (sect), so worship I;" in Acts 26:5, "after the most strict *sect* of our religion I lived a Pharisee;" and in Acts 28:22, "as for this *sect* (of the Christians), we know that it is everywhere spoken against." Besides these six occurrences, we find it used twice by Paul in his letters, and once by Peter: 1 Cor. 11:19, "For there must be *heresies* (sects) among you;" Gal. 5:20, "Sedition, heresies;" and 2 Peter 2:1, "Shall bring in damnable heresies." In the common version, it is rendered *sect* five times and *heresy* four times.

The word *sect* or *heresy,* found only in the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles, does not always in the former simply mean a *party,* without regard to its beliefs; the term carries no reproach or honor — nothing virtuous or vicious. Hence, it is equally applied to Pharisees, Sadducees, Nazarenes, or Christians, without any implication about the character of the party. It is only rendered *heresy* once in the "Acts," and in that instance, it should have been *sect.* Paul had been accused by Tertullus (Acts 24:6) of being "a ringleader of the *sect* of the Nazarenes." In defending himself against this accusation, he should have addressed the charge under the same title. He did so in the original; for in verse 5, in the indictment, and in verse 14, in his defense, the same word *hairesis* is used. How unwise, then, was it for our translators and the Vulgate to have Tertullus accuse Paul of a *sect* and to have Paul defend himself against a *heresy,* when both Tertullus and Paul used the same word in their speeches as reported by Luke in the original!

In the new version, this word is, as it should be, consistently rendered *sect.* In the Epistles, and apparently once in Acts, it is used as though it carries an idea of censure or guilt. Paul defends himself from Tertullus's accusation. Here, then, a question arises — "Why should the term *hairesis* imply blame in its *Christian* context, but not in its *Jewish* context?" We answer, because among the Jews, sects or parties did not result in separate communities or communions as they did among Christians. They resembled the high and low church parties in the Episcopalian communion or the various sects among Roman Catholics, such as Benedictines, Franciscans, Dominicans, Jesuits, etc., which never resulted in a breach of communion or cooperation as one church. Thus, the Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodians, etc., frequented the same temple, altar, priesthood, and united in all the same acts of worship. Not so the Jews and Samaritans: they were real *sects* in the Christian sense. Again, among the Jews, the bond of union was national and physical; therefore, parties could not destroy it. For us, it is spiritual, social, and heartfelt — one faith, one hope, one spirit; and parties are destructive in the highest degree.

There is only one plausible objection to this view, and we address it in response to the question, "*Why did Paul defend himself against Tertullus's accusation as if it indicated censure, if sects among the Jews were such harmless and inoffensive things?*" We answer, there is no blame in the simple accusation of a sect, but in the ideas that Tertullus associated with it. The Romans had agreed to protect the Jews in the practice of their religion, and they wanted to make Paul appear as an apostate from that religion in the presence of Felix — "a pestilent fellow, a mover of *sedition,* a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes" — so that he might be stripped of the protection granted to the Jewish religion. Only from this perspective can we understand the wisdom of Paul's defense. He admits the charge of being a *sectary,* but in no criminal sense — worshipping the same God as them, believing every word in their law and Prophets, and sharing the same hope of a future life in the resurrection of the dead; thus demonstrating that nothing offensive or criminal could be attributed to him for being a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.

In the Christian epistles, however, it is used in a negative sense and is always associated with censure. This may have been the reason why King James' version changes the translation to *heresies,* or, as in the case of *baptism, bishop,* etc., anglicizes rather than translates the word. However, this is not a good or sufficient reason, because it necessarily leads the English reader to believe that *heresy* in the epistles and *sect* in the Acts of the Apostles are two distinct and different things; and this, of course, not only obscures those passages but also hinders a clear understanding of a matter essential to our duty and happiness. The meaning, however, is not materially different in the epistles, except in the relationship of things. When the word *sect* is connected with a proper name, such as the *sect* of the Pharisees, the *sect* of the Sadducees, or the *sect* of the Christians, it is used in a neutral sense, neither indicating truth or error, good or evil; but if it is applied to a party formed in a community that admits of no division or subdivision in its nature, because it necessarily leads to its corruption and destruction; then, in that context and sense, a sect is a destructive and condemnable thing. In the Epistles, it is always taken in this sense and is categorized with *factions,* as a work of the flesh, carnal and destructive, and destined for the judgments of Heaven.

Still, in its scriptural application, whether used by Luke, Paul, or Peter — and it is found in no other writer — it never relates to doctrine, tenet, opinion, or faith. There is no *tenet* or *doctrine* in sacred usage that is called *heresy* or *sect.* Hence, that ecclesiastical definition, viz. — "*Heresy denotes some erroneous opinion, tenet, or doctrine obstinately persisted in,*" is without any support from the New Testament. *Heresy* and *heretical,* in the words of Paul and Peter, and in the words of an ancient or modern scholar or churchman, are two very different things.

But some argue that any doctrine that causes division is heretical and therefore condemnable. It may be accepted, for the sake of argument, that any doctrine or action that causes division is heretical or divisive; but for that reason, it is not condemnable; because in that sense, Jesus Christ was a heretic and his gospel heresy: for he came to create divisions on earth and did establish a sect; and of course, his doctrine is divisive or heretical.

Now, if we say Jesus was a *heretic,* and his gospel *heresy,* and his followers *sectarians,* does this not strip the word of any negative or culpable significance, making both heretics, heresies, and sects innocent things? It does, as far as all outside of Christ's kingdom or institution are concerned. But this is the crucial difference here; Christians, distinguished from Jews, Muslims, Pagans, and Infidels, are lawfully, righteously, and innocently a sect, a heresy: but a sect among these is corrupt, treasonous, and highly reprehensible, according to every precept, doctrine, and saying of the New Institution. Thus, a person may be a Christian, or part of the sect of the Nazarenes, but not a Lutheran, a Calvinist, or an Arminian, without blame.
The words *schisms* and *heresy* explained so far, can we not see schism as the cause and heresy as the effect? In other words, should we not view sects as the results of schisms? The philosophy of the whole matter is that separation is the result of a divided heart, and this division is the outcome of competing attachments, which in the church usually start with personal likes or dislikes and end up detaching individuals from the body of Christ. In this perspective, Paul seems to reason in 1 Cor. 11:18-19: "There are *schisms* among you — for there must be *sects* among you, that the approved may be made manifest." The schisms in Corinth began with particular preferences for prominent teachers like Paul, Apollos, and Cephas. These preferences violated the *unity of spirit,* the oneness of heart essential to being one body in Christ, leading to factions in the church, as seen in how they celebrated the supper. The same spirit in other communities ultimately resulted in visible separations and distinct sects, as seen among the professed members of Christ's body today.

Paul, in commenting on this ancient schism, further notes that there *must* be sects in such a situation, so that "the *approved* may be made manifest." It is indeed true that all strife, contention, parties, and sects arise from corruption. Sects are the result of corruptions. The approved hold on to Christ, and thus become evident; the disapproved follow human leaders and are also made evident. There seems to be no other remedy for a corrupt and mixed community than heresies or sects. It is as wise and benevolent a provision in a remedial system that incurable corruption should manifest in this way, as the law in the animal kingdom that forces all harmful humors to the surface, forming swellings and boils from those harmful particles that would otherwise spoil the entire system and lead to the body's ruin.

People do not become enamored with Paul, Peter, and Cephas in a partisan sense until they have lost some of their love for Christ. Therefore, the first sign of personal favoritism or sectarian attachment is the first evidence of decline, backsliding, or apostasy. Partisan attachment is at the core of the first sin and carries within it the first element of hatred. Thus, we see that someone loves Wesley for any sectarian trait, hates Calvin in proportion to their attachment to their leader; just as someone who loves Calvin for his human qualities hates Wesley for opposing them. However, someone who loves only what is Christian in both does not hate either but grieves for the errors and shortcomings of both. For this reason alone, we should earnestly and devoutly avoid partisanship; for it should be rejected because our hatred of one party will always be proportional to our love for its opponent; and in all such cases, both our love and our hatred are subject to God's disapproval and indeed fall under the condemnation of His express judgment.

For this reason, we find the word *hairesis* in the next place, and the only other time it appears in Paul's letters, immediately following "*factions*" and before "*envyings*" and "*murders*" in Paul's listing and classification of the works of the flesh, Gal. 5:20-21. Paul strongly and repeatedly affirms that those who commit such acts shall not "enter the kingdom of God." He states, "The works of the flesh are evident, which are these — fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, sorcery, enmities, strife, emulations, wrath, brawling, *factions, sects,* envyings, murders, intoxication," etc. Every sectarian is, therefore, judged by Paul to be a fleshly person and outside the kingdom of God. A severe judgment, indeed! How should we understand it?

It is now even clearer that *heresies* are not merely opinions, beliefs, doctrines, or theories; for who would claim that opinions, beliefs, or theories, as such, are works of the flesh? Or who would say that fleshly principles are the roots or reasons for mere opinions, beliefs, or theories? Corrupt opinions may indeed be more easily spread or accepted by corrupt individuals; but to label opinions or beliefs, even those sectarian opinions on which some parties are founded, as works of the flesh is to confuse mental weakness or a poor education with a corrupt heart; for nothing can be called a work of the flesh that does not involve the corruptions of the heart. *Hairesis* in this context, then, means sects, as it always does in the New Testament.

Still, the question arises: Are all religious sects works of the flesh? Paul makes no exceptions. We dare not. He does not speak of philosophical, political, or foreign factions and sects; but of those related to the Christian faith. Among the Jews, Paul himself was a *Pharisee*; among the political groups, he was a *Roman*; but in religion, he was a Christian; not a Calvinist, Arminian, or Methodist; but a Christian. Indeed, Paul himself, in his account of sectarians, or of the founders and creators of religious parties, traces all their zeal and effort to self-interest rather than to conscience or love of truth. "Mark those," he says, "who cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine you have received, and avoid them; for such people do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own *belly*; and by flattery and fair speech deceive the hearts of the simple." Surely such sectarians and sects are "the works of the flesh."

But here we should define a *factionist* and a *sectary,* since nowadays we have some sectarians who are not factionists, and some factionists and factions that are more than mere sectarians. The factionist, or as Paul calls him, the "heretic," creates the faction. The faction consists of those who side with him. Meanwhile, the ordinary sectarians are those who are simply led by the heretic, deceived by his flatteries and fair speeches, without any ulterior motive driving their actions. Many sectarians, in the simplicity of their hearts, believe their party to be the true and only church of Christ, and therefore adhere to it conscientiously. Others think that no party is the church of Christ, but that He has a church in all parties — an invisible church — to which they believe they belong, and therefore associate with all of a similar nature in all parties as far as they know. These differ significantly from the schismatics, heretics, and factionists of Paul. Those either created or worked to maintain a party or a sect; and all such individuals are corrupt, fleshly people; because, out of pride in their own opinions, from rivalry, ambition, or the love of money, they are driven to create or maintain a faction or sect that aligns with their views and interests. These serve their own desires and focus on earthly matters. However, a large number of sectarians are following, as they believe, Jesus Christ and His Apostles, under the names and beliefs of Luther, Calvin, Wesley, etc. They are, unknowingly, merely followers of men: for they examine nothing for themselves with a constant and habitual reference to the Bible.

Now, what may be the extent of carnality and fleshly or worldly influence that keeps them there, and what may be the extent of patience and forgiveness exercised towards them from heaven, I do not presume to assert; but that the factionist — the person who creates a party, and he who works to sustain it, are certainly earthly, sensual, and demonic; and, as such, not part of the kingdom of God, we cannot help but assert as a deep and rational conviction, derived from the most impartial examination of the sacred scriptures — from the clearest and most ample testimony of the Holy Spirit, speaking to us through the words of Prophets and Apostles.

The Christian party is "built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, and on Jesus the Messiah, Himself the chief cornerstone," and therefore *on the Christian Scriptures alone*; not, indeed, as distinct from the Jewish, but as the development and full revelation of all that concerns Christ and His kingdom contained in those scriptures. Now, all other parties that differ in any way from the Christian party are built upon some mixture — some creed, formula, or human institution that supplements the apostolic laws and customs. This mixture is what forms the party. So many elements of the Apostles' doctrine combined with so many ideas of Calvin produce the compound known as Calvinism. So many elements of Luther's opinions, combined with the Apostles' teaching, create Lutheranism. And so many aspects of Wesley's speculations, combined with certain parts of the New Testament, result in the compound known as Methodism. The Christian elements in these compounds, as long as they are not neutralized by the human mixture, make the Christians among them; while the mixture creates the sectarian. Remove all that belongs to the founder of the sect in all these parties, and they would certainly merge into one community.

Now, we do not believe that there is the same guilt in forming a new Protestant party as there was in initially forming the Roman Catholic, the Greek, or any of the ancient sects. The modern sects have been established with the desire to return to primitive Christianity; the ancient sects arose directly from the lust for power — from fleshly, selfish, and worldly motives. Now, however, since we have so extensively experienced the bitterness and consequences of sects and parties; and have learned the cause, the cure, and the prevention of sectarianism, woe to all who are found maintaining the old boundaries of strife, or laying the groundwork for new rivalries, partialities, and antipathies to arise and corrupt many, to hinder the progress of the gospel abroad, and to foster the spirit of unbelief at home.
There remains another instance of *heresy* (sect) in the writings of Peter that has not yet been formally examined. We will now specifically consider it. This Apostle says, "There will be false teachers among you who will secretly introduce *destructive sects,* denying even the Lord who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves; and many will follow their immoral practices." Paul, in his farewell address to the Ephesians, also speaks of "grievous wolves devouring the flock, and of men rising from their own group to draw away disciples after them, speaking perverse things." From these indications, we learn that the Apostles Paul and Peter foresaw the rise of sectarians and sects; and both of them, it is worth noting, clearly connected the sects with sectarian teachers: for all sects have been started by false teachers or corrupt individuals. Sectarians, it seems, occupy the same position under Christ that false prophets held under Moses. Do we need to infer the danger of maintaining religious sects, or continue to prove that everyone who builds up a party shares in the wrongdoing of the one who established it?

It is essential for all people who wish to be approved by the Lord at His coming to actively work to purge and cleanse the Christian faith from every root and branch of sectarianism, and to strive to eliminate those destructive sects that have been a sort of Pandora's box for humanity; that have filled the faith with hypocrites, the world with infidels, and delayed for so many centuries the conversion of both Jews and Gentiles to the Christian faith.

Finally, while working to abolish the old sects, let us be careful not to create a new one. This can happen by either adding to or subtracting from the apostolic teachings even a single item. Our platform must be as long and as broad as the New Testament. Every person that the Apostles would accept, if present, we must accept; and therefore the one faith, one Lord, one baptism, one hope, one body, one Spirit, one God and Father of all, must be the basis for one, and only one table.

Factionists, or opinionists, or those who seek to attach people to themselves because of their opinions or talents, or personal circumstances, whatever they may be, should be seen as the very roots of bitterness in the Christian church — as seeking their own interests, honors, and profits, and not the things of Jesus Christ. It was such spirits that led to the ancient schisms and sects; and similar spirits, of which every generation can provide its share, keep them alive. All such individuals may not have the power to effect much; but now and then, one arises and succeeds in drawing away disciples after him. We can suggest no better remedies or preventives than those commanded by the Apostles. Let us hold fast to their traditions; contend only for the faith; allow differences of opinion; suffer no dogmatists; support none of the disciples of Diotrephes; and walk in love, guided by that wisdom which is "first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be persuaded, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy."

From the preceding conclusions, it will seem, we presume, very clear to all that we need neither telescopes nor microscopes to detect *heresies* in the New Testament sense of that word. They are neither more nor less than sects — plain, obvious sects and parties. Every party in Christendom, regardless of any of its beliefs, opinions, or practices, is a *heresy,* a schism — unless there exists a party that stands exactly on the Apostles' ground. In that case, it is a sect just in the sense of the old sect of the Nazarenes, later called *Christians,* and all others are guilty before the Lord and must be condemned for their opposition to Christ's own party; whose party we are, provided we hold fast to all, and only all apostolic traditions, and build upon the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible.

# 8. The Purposes of God Concerning Man

The universe came from the goodness of God. Not to showcase his power and wisdom, but to express his kindness, God created the heavens and the earth, filling them with all kinds of beings. Infinite wisdom and almighty power merely carry out the designs of eternal love. Goodness is the driving attribute that inspired everything the counsel and hand of the Lord have accomplished. The flow of the universe is entirely on the side of benevolence. "Abundant in goodness and truth," all of God's designs aim for the spread of happiness on the largest possible scale. Evil exists; but under the benevolent administration of the Father of mercies, there will be as much good, with as little evil, as almighty power, guided by infinite wisdom and goodness, can achieve.

We can speculate a lot, but we can know little about the origin of moral evil in God's domain. Its history on earth is thoroughly detailed in the Bible; and that, in divine wisdom, is all that is necessary for our successful struggle against its power and joyful escape from its consequences. It is not necessary for us to analyze and understand the origin and nature of darkness in order to enjoy the light of the sun. The effects of light and darkness on our system are quite enough, without any theory, to encourage us to avoid the former and delight in the latter. "By one man sin entered into the world," says Paul; and "by one tempter sin entered into man," says Moses; and "lust when it conceives brings forth sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death," says James the Apostle, and these are the landmarks of our understanding of the matter.

To limit the spread of sin, to prevent its recurrence in any part of the universe, and to save sinners from its destructive consequences, are the divine purposes of the common Father of all. The Gospel, or Christian system, is the only plan that infinite intelligence and almighty love could devise for that kind and gracious end. This purpose, like all of God's purposes, is eternal and unchanging. The plan was, therefore, not only arranged before the Jewish and patriarchal ages, but before the foundation of the world.

The promises made to Eve, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, David, etc. are clear evidence that the plan was laid and the purposes perfected before the world began. For why, we ask, could God promise the defeat of Satan by the son of Eve, the blessing of all nations through the son of Abraham, etc., if a plan of this significance had not been previously established? The moment that Adam, Eve, and the serpent were judged marks the first promise of a glorious victory over our adversary by a descendant of Eve. That promise, along with the subsequent institution of sacrifice — the altar, the victim, and the priest — are ample proof that the plan was completed and a remedial system adopted before the trial of our first parents.

But this is not merely to be inferred even from the premises, clear and compelling as they are. It is expressly and repeatedly stated. Two things are evident as demonstration itself: — The first, — that all the *purposes* and *promises* of God are in Christ — in reference to him, and fulfilled in and by him; and, secondly, they were all contemplated, covenanted, and organized in him and through him *before the foundation of the world.* These two propositions are so closely connected that they are generally asserted in the same portions of Scripture. For example: "He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us *in* Christ Jesus before the world began; but is *now* made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ." 2 Tim. 1:9-10. Again, "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, *promised before the world began;* but has in due time manifested his word through preaching." Titus 1:1-16; Titus 2:1-15; Titus 3:1 "He has chosen us *in him before the foundation of the world,* that we should be holy and without blame before him in love." Eph. 1:4. Indeed, Jesus himself suggests that the entire matter of man's redemption, even to the preparation of the eternal homes of the righteous, was arranged before time began: for, in his own parable of the final judgment, he says, "Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit a *kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.*" Matt. 25:34. And Peter settles the matter forever by assuring us that we "were redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, who truly was foreordained *before the foundation of the world.*" Christ, then, is the Lamb that was *foreordained,* and "slain from the foundation of the world." Therefore, says Jesus to his Father, speaking undoubtedly in contemplation of his work, "You loved me before the foundation of the world;" and thus, as Matthew quotes a Prophet speaking of him, "he spoke things which had been kept secret from the foundation of the world."

It is evident, then, that the entire remedial or gospel system was purposed, arranged, and established on the basis of the revealed distinctions of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; and by these, in reference to one another, before the foundation of the world; and that all the institutions and developments of religion in the different ages of the world were, in pursuit of that system, devised in eternity and fulfilled about two thousand years ago.

Jesus of Nazareth, the promised Messiah, was chosen, or rather was always the chosen one, the beloved of God, and appointed to be the foundation of the new creation. "Behold," said Jehovah, seven centuries before his birth, "I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation," called by Peter "an elect stone," though rejected by the Jewish builders. Again, by the same Prophet, he is called the elect of God: "Behold my servant whom I uphold, my *elect* in whom my soul delights! I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles," etc. "He shall be for salvation to the ends of the earth."

As a result of these gracious purposes of God, the **Word** was made flesh and dwelt among us — the Son of God was *sent* by his Father — became a Prophet, a High Priest, and a King over people, so that he might be the mediator and administrator of an Institution of Grace. He became the righteous servant of Jehovah, a voluntary sacrifice for us — died, was buried, and rose again — ascended where he had been before — then, in union with his Father, sent the Holy Spirit, who proceeded forth from the presence and by the authority of the Father and the Son, to complete the sanctification of his people. He is now placed upon the throne of God — head over all things to fulfill the triumphs of his cause — to lead many sons to glory — to raise the dead, judge the world, and take vengeance on Satan and all who joined him in his rebellion, whether angels or men — to create new heavens and a new earth, and to establish eternal peace, love, and joy throughout all the new dominions he shall have gained, and over which he shall have reigned: for he must reign until all his and our enemies shall have been subdued forever. Then he shall return to the hands that gave him his empire, all that type of authority which he exercised in this great work of human deliverance. Then God himself, in his original character and glory, as he reigned before sin was born and his administration began, shall preside over all things in all places forever and ever.

The current elect of God are, then, those who are *in Christ,* and not those outside of him: for it was *in him* that God has set his affection upon them, and chose them for eternal life before the world began. God is not, indeed, in this whole affair a respecter of persons. It is at character, and not at person, that God looks. He has predestined all who are in Christ "to be holy and without blame before him in love," and, at his coming, to be confirmed to him in all personal excellence and beauty, and to share with him the joy of a glorious immortality. So that "we shall be like him" — he is the *firstborn,* and we his younger siblings, bearing his image in our persons as exactly as we now bear the image of the earthly Adam, the father of us all.

In all these gracious purposes of God, two things are most remarkable: — First, that he has elected and called certain individuals to high and responsible positions as parts of a grand system of practical philanthropy — such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, David, Paul, etc. These were chosen and elevated not for their own sake, but as public benefactors and blessings to the human race. It is not for its own sake that the eye is so beautiful, or performs the functions of vision; nor that the ear is so intricately designed, and performs the function of hearing; but for the general comfort and safety of the whole body. So stand in the family of God — in the body of Christ, all apostles, prophets, preachers, reformers, and all specially called and chosen individuals. As the Lord said to Saul of Tarsus, so may it be said of all those sons of oil — those elect ones — "I have appeared to you to make you a minister and a witness for me — to send you to the Gentiles," etc. — *to make you a public benefactor.* Next to this remarkable fact is another even more remarkable; — that, according to the purposes of God in reference to the whole human race, things are so arranged and set in order that all enjoyments shall be, as respects human agency, *conditional;* and that every person, in reference to spiritual and eternal blessings, shall certainly and infallibly have his own choice. Therefore, life and death, good and evil, happiness and misery, are placed before man as he now is, and he is commanded to make his own choice and take his decision. Having chosen the good portion, he is then to "give all diligence to make his *calling* and *election* sure."
<sub>1: In the original, the phrase in these two passages is *pro chronoon aionoon,* sometimes translated as "*before the time of ages*" — before the Jewish jubilees or ages began; and it means that God's purpose to call the Gentiles was prior to the covenants with Abraham and the Jews. Understood this way, it only shows that the purposes and promises of God in Christ were formed and expressed before the days of Abraham. But it is equally true regarding the beginning of time: for the phrase *pro* and *apo katabole kosmou,* found *ten times* in the New Testament, literally indicates the foundation of the world. We quote Eph. 1:4. — Matt. 25:34. — 1 Pe 1:19-20. — as clearly declaring this.</sub>

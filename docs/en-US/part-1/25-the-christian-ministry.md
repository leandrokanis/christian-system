# 25. The Christian Ministry

"He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for *the work of the ministry,* for the edifying of the body of Christ; till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ," etc. For the establishment of the Christian institution, extraordinary officers were needed. This was true in the Jewish context, and it applies to every institution, both human and divine. However, once an institution is established, it only requires an ordinary ministry or administration of its affairs. All the extraordinary gifts given to Moses, and to the Apostles and Prophets of the gospel institution, ceased when these institutions were fully developed and established. Still, a regular and constant ministry was needed among the Jews, and is still needed among Christians; and both of these are by divine authority.

Natural gifts for a natural state of affairs, and supernatural gifts for a supernatural state of affairs, are, in the wisdom of both God and man, appropriate and necessary. Hence, even in the apostolic age, there were officers both with and without miraculous endowments. "Having, then, gifts differing according to the office, or grace that is given to us — if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the measure of our faith; or ministry, let us attend to our ministering; he who teaches, to teaching; he who exhorts, to exhortation; he who distributes, with simplicity; he who rules, with diligence." God has therefore conferred various gifts on the church for the effective administration of its affairs. He has placed in it "*helps* and *governments,*" as well as Apostles and Prophets.

The standing and unchanging ministry of the Christian community is composed of Bishops, Deacons, and Evangelists. Each of these has only one order, though they possess a wide variety of gifts. There have been bishops, deacons, and evangelists, with both ordinary and extraordinary gifts. Still, the office is now, and always has been, the same. In ancient times, both official and unofficial persons sometimes possessed miraculous gifts. Those in high office were generally among those most notably gifted with extraordinary powers. Superficial readers have sometimes concluded that since bishops, deacons, and especially evangelists, frequently possessed these manifestations of the Holy Spirit, the offices themselves also ceased when those gifts did. This is a significant misunderstanding. Officers must exist as long as there are offices or services to be performed. As long as the human body needs sight, hearing, and feeling, there will be eyes, ears, and hands. Likewise, as long as the Christian body is an organized entity with many services to perform, it must have organs or officers through which to function and engage with society.

Indeed, there must be as many offices in every body as there are services to be performed for it or by it. This is the root and reason for all the offices in the entire universe of God. Our planet requires diverse celestial services to be performed for it. Hence, the sun, moon, and stars are celestial officers ministering to it. The eye, the ear, the tongue, the hand, and the foot are, for the same reason, officers in the human body, essentially serving it in its vital interests and enjoyments; and through these organs, it performs important functions for other bodies.

Experience, as well as observation, has taught us that "practice makes perfect," and that "whatever is everyone's business is no one's business." Hence arose the custom among people of assigning certain offices to particular individuals. The philosophy behind such elections and appointments is found in the fact that special services are best performed by specific organs or agents, whose special role and duty is to attend to them.

As the Christian system is a perfect system, it wisely provides for its own continuity and prosperity by creating all necessary offices and filling them with suitable individuals. We have said these offices are three, and of perpetual nature, because of their necessary existence. *Bishops,* whose role is to preside over, instruct, and edify the community — to feed the church of the Lord with knowledge and understanding — and to watch over their souls as those who must give account to the Lord at his appearing and his kingdom, make up the first class. *Deacons,* or servants — whether called treasurers, almoners, stewards, door-keepers, or messengers, constitute the second. The term *deacon* originally included all public servants, though now it is most commonly confined to one or two classes; and improperly, no doubt, to those only who attend to the mere temporal interests of the community. They are distinguished individuals, called and commissioned by the church, (and consequently are always responsible to it,) to serve in any of these capacities. Evangelists, however, while a class of public functionaries created by the church, do not serve it directly; instead, they are sent out into the world by it, and make up the third class of functionaries belonging to the Christian system.

As there is more scrutiny among some regarding the third class of Evangelists than concerning either Bishops or Deacons, we will take the opportunity to speak more explicitly and fully about the nature and necessity, as well as the authority of this office. Evangelists, as the term indicates, are individuals dedicated to preaching the word, making converts, and planting churches. It is indeed mentioned only three times in the New Testament; however, the verb from which it comes — namely, to *evangelize,* is found in various forms almost sixty times in that text. "To evangelize" and "to do the work of an evangelist" are phrases of equal meaning, indicating the same duties, rights, and privileges.

Among the offices included in the apostleship, none required more varied endowments than that of the Evangelist. The gift of tongues was among the qualifications necessary for those who, after the ascension, first undertook this work. However, the qualifications for this office, as far as the gift of tongues or knowledge of language is concerned, are not fixed. It depends on the field of labor the Evangelist is to occupy, whether he must speak one language or more. His work is to proclaim the word clearly and persuasively — to immerse all the believers or converts of his ministry — and to plant and organize churches wherever he has the opportunity; and then teach them to keep the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.

Take, for example, the account given by Luke of the labors of Philip the Evangelist, one of the first to hold that title. One of the seven ministers of the Jerusalem church, after his diaconate was vacated by the dispersion of that community, he began his evangelical work. He turned his attention toward Samaria and preached and baptized among the Samaritans: for we are told that when the Samaritans believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the Lord Jesus, they were baptized, both men and women. He also converted the Ethiopian Eunuch; and then, passing from Azotus, he "preached *in all the cities* until he came to Caesarea," where he later resided. The next mention we have of him is found in Acts 21:8. "We," says Luke, who were with Paul, departed and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the Evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him. He had four virgin daughters who prophesied." It is evident, then, that he obtained the title *Evangelist* from his itinerant work in the gospel and in converting people. His possession of the gift of the Holy Spirit was no more unique to him as an evangelist than as a deacon of the church in Jerusalem; for while in the diaconate of that church, he seems to have been as filled with the Holy Spirit as when visiting all the cities from Azotus to Caesarea.

Gathering converts into communities and organizing them into worshipping assemblies are inseparably connected with the right of converting them. Casually, in his letters to Timothy, Paul seems to define the work of an Evangelist. He says, "Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all patience and teaching; endure hardship; *do the work of an Evangelist;* fulfill your ministry." "Let no one despise your youth. Until I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching. Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy — by the laying on of hands of the presbytery or eldership." "Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all: take heed to yourself and to your teaching; continue in them: for in doing this, you will both save yourself and those who hear you." This seems to be the office of an Evangelist that the Lord gave to the church after his ascension.

Setting things in order in the churches — committing the same office to faithful individuals who will be able to instruct others — ordaining elders, and general oversight of the affairs of churches, seem to have also been entrusted to Timothy and Titus as agents of the Apostles. How far these tasks are still necessary, and how far the oversight of them may be safely entrusted to select Evangelists concerning *infant communities,* may be a question open to various interpretations. However, that Evangelists are to gather their own converts into communities, teach and oversee them until they are able to care for themselves, is undoubtedly a part of the office of an Evangelist, just as much as praying, preaching, or baptizing.

But we may be asked, 'Isn't preaching and baptizing, and even teaching, the common privilege of all disciples, as they have the opportunity?' And we also respond, 'Isn't it the privilege of all parents to teach their own children and to lead their own families?' But whoever infers that all parents are teachers and leaders does not shock common sense more than the one who infers that all disciples, as such, are evangelists, pastors, and teachers, simply because we concede that in certain cases it is the privilege of all citizens of Christ's kingdom to preach, baptize, and teach. Every citizen of Christ's kingdom has, by virtue of their citizenship, equal rights, privileges, and immunities. So does every citizen of the United States. Yet not all citizens are legislators, magistrates, judges, governors, etc. Before any community, civil or religious, is organized, every person has equal rights to do what seems good in their own eyes. But once organized, and individuals appointed to office, whatever rights, duties, and privileges are conferred on specific individuals cannot rightfully belong to those who have transferred them; any more than a person can both give and keep the same thing.
But there are some responsibilities and privileges we cannot completely pass on to others. Parents cannot fully delegate the education of their children to others; neither can a master transfer all his responsibilities to a steward or overseer. Similarly, the citizens of Christ's kingdom cannot entirely transfer their duties to preach and teach Christ. To enlighten the ignorant, to persuade the unbelieving, and to encourage the disobedient when they come our way and we have the ability or opportunity, is a duty that cannot be transferred. Even the Roman Catholic Church, with all its clerical pride, permits and authorizes *lay baptism* when a priest is not available. A Christian is, by profession, a preacher of truth and righteousness, both by teaching and example. *He has the right to preach, baptize, and serve communion, as well as pray for all people, when circumstances require it.* However, this allowance does not eliminate the need for evangelists, bishops, and deacons; nor does it give any individual the authority to take on responsibilities that have been entrusted to them. True freedom without chaos, and governance without oppression, is the essence of the Christian institution.

While the Christian system allows every person "to minister as a good steward of the manifold grace of God, according to the gifts they have received," it also provides for the selection and appointment of qualified individuals for all its specific services, which are essential for its own growth and comfort, as well as its effectiveness in the world. It ensures its own continuity and growth in the most wise and practical way. Its entire wisdom can be summarized in four points: — 1st. It establishes the necessary offices for its continuity and growth. 2nd. It selects the best-qualified individuals for those offices. 3rd. It consecrates or sets those individuals apart for those offices. 4th. It commands them to dedicate themselves fully to the work, so that their development keeps pace with the growth of the body and is evident to all. Can anyone identify a flaw in this plan? — !

All its officers, whether for services at home or abroad, when fully qualified, are to be formally and solemnly set apart by the laying on of hands by the presbytery or eldership of the church. The entire community chooses — the elders ordain. *This is the apostolic tradition.* Let those unfamiliar with the scriptures examine the apostolic law and practice; Acts 6:2-6. Thus, the Christian system in its elections and ordinations began. *It is unchanging.* Therefore, this system applies in all cases. The qualifications for any office are always based on the nature of the office. They are generally outlined, but not always, because the *work to be done* is the best guide in determining the qualifications of the person doing it.

We say that the elders always ordain. The Roman Catholic Church claims, 'Only those on whom the apostolic hands have been laid can rightfully ordain.' *Such an idea is not part of the Christian system.* The elders always lay on hands, whether hands have been laid on them or not. This is true Protestantism. Better yet, it is true biblical practice. *In fact, it is the Christian System.* The Apostles laid on hands because they were *elders,* not because they were *apostles.* This is the crux of a controversy that has lasted fifteen hundred years. It has been widely, almost universally, misrepresented and overlooked. Protestants are as much Papists in this regard as Papists are Protestants in rejecting Protestantism. It is assumed by Romanists, and conceded by Protestants, that "*holy hands*" are official hands by a *divine right.* They are sometimes, but not always. However, *Christian elders,* (for I do not mean merely older men,) who have long walked in the ways of the Lord, have holy hands and much more power with and from the Lord than has ever resided in any pope or self-proclaimed vicar of Christ in twelve hundred and sixty years.

To prove that elders lay on hands, we refer to Acts 6:1-15, for the Apostles were the oldest converts in Jerusalem. We also refer to the fact that the presbytery or eldership laid hands on Timothy and gave him the gift or office of an evangelist. And are there two rules of ordination in one system? Paul and Barnabas, though *Apostles,* were themselves ordained by the church of Antioch through its presbytery. Consequently, *elders in Christ, as such,* can, with divine authority, lay hands on any individuals for any office to which the church has elected them. This must also be done with prayer and fasting. See Acts 6:6; Acts 13:3; Acts 14:23.

Individuals may be younger in age and older in Christ. Timothy, Paul says, "*do not lay hands on anyone hastily.*" This implies that those being ordained were younger in the faith; and until they had developed some character and standing as elders, (even Timothy himself,) he was not to agree to their ordination. It may be necessary to clarify that classic presbytery and the presbytery of a single church are very different institutions. The Apostles ordained *elders* (a presbytery) in every church. They did not make young men old, but set apart those who were elders in the Lord to the office of overseers. They did not make juniors *elders,* but they made elders *bishops.*

The community, the church, the multitude of the faithful, are the source of official power. This power comes from the body itself — not from its servants. Servants made by servants are servants of servants; and such are all the clergy of the Man of Sin. But the body of Christ, under him as its head, animated and led by his spirit, is the source and spring of all official power and privilege. How much more certain and pure is ecclesiastical authority derived directly from Christ the head, through his body, than when it is derived through a long, questionable, corrupt line of bishops or popes! The church is the mother of all the sons and priests of God; and to seek authority from her servants or creations, as do all kinds of Papists, whether Catholic or Protestant, is to worship and serve the creature more than the Creator — a form of idolatry worthy only of the darkest night of the darkest day of the dark ages.

However, the church needs messengers for special occasions — not only her regular deacons and ministers, but extraordinary ministers as well. These too are selected by the church or churches in a given area and *commissioned by their letters.* They are not consecrated by the laying on of hands, but *approved by letters* from the community. If we are asked for authority, we present it gladly. 1 Cor. 16:3 is directly relevant: "And," says Paul to the saints in Corinth, "when I come, *whomever you approve by letters,* I will send to bring your generosity to Jerusalem." This is the apostolic practice in such cases. In the second letter, Paul says, "We have sent Titus the brother (we believe it is Luke) whose praise is in the gospel (written by him) throughout all the churches — who was also *chosen by the churches* to travel with us this gift," etc.

The Christian system requires bishops, deacons, and evangelists for its continuity and prosperity at home and abroad. Its bishops teach, preside, and enforce the laws of Christ in all its gatherings. The deacons, a large and diverse group of functionaries, including stewards, treasurers, almoners, door-keepers, etc., as needed, continually attend to its various services. Its evangelists, who possess the necessary qualifications, are ordained and consecrated to the work of the Lord in converting sinners and establishing churches, by a presbytery or a board of elders competent to responsibly carry out the duty, are constantly engaged in increasing its membership. These ministers of the word are commanded to be fully dedicated to this work and, therefore, to be fully supported by their fellow believers in it. They are held accountable to all the holy brethren, and to the Lord at his appearing and his kingdom, for the faithful execution of that sacred trust placed in them.

What an effective institution is that over which Christ presides, when well understood and fully implemented in all its details! With its bishops and deacons at home, and its evangelists abroad, fully committed to the faithful execution of their respective responsibilities; men of experience, faith, piety, morality, full of zeal, energy, and benevolence, working together with all similar institutions, supported by the prayers and voluntary contributions of all the united people, having the love of God in their hearts, and heaven in their sights, what might they not achieve for the glory of God, the good of humanity, and their own honor! Of such an army of faith, in full operation and coordination, it might indeed be asked, "Who is this that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners!"

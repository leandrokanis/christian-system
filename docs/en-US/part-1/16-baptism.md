# 16. Baptism

There are three things to consider in baptism: — 1. The action commanded to be done; — 2. The subject specified; — 3. The meaning or purpose of that action. Jesus commanded a certain *character* to be the subject of a certain *action,* for a specific purpose or *design.* The questions, then, are: What is that action? What is that subject? What is that design?

## Of The Action of Baptism

The action is indicated by a word as definite, clear, and unequivocal as any word in any language ever spoken by the many-tongued descendants of Adam. Furthermore, in all laws and institutions, especially those that are of a *positive,* rather than a *moral* nature, all words that have both a literal and a figurative meaning, a common and a special significance, are to be understood in their literal and common sense, and not in their figurative and uncommon meaning. This has been affirmed by all judges of law and language throughout history.

That definite and unambiguous word, as almost universally recognized in these days of controversy, is *baptisma,* or *baptismos,* anglicized, not translated, as *baptism.* The primary means by which the meaning of this word is determined are the following: 1. The ancient lexicons and dictionaries; — 2. The ancient and modern translations of the New Testament; — 3. The ancient customs of the church; — 4. The place and circumstances of baptizing, as mentioned in the New Testament; — and 5. The references to this ordinance and the explanations of it in the apostolic letters. To each of these, we will briefly refer on this occasion.

1. **The ancient lexicons unanimously give *immersion* as the natural, common, and primary sense of this word.** We are not aware of a single exception. Nor is there a recognized lexicon, ancient or modern, that translates this word as *sprinkling* or *pouring.* Since there are only three *actions* allowed for Christian baptism, and since the original words, both verbs and nouns, are translated as *immerse* and *immersion* in all lexicons, and never as *sprinkle* or *pour,* does it not follow that neither sprinkling nor pouring is Christian baptism? The question is not whether these words are ever, like other words, used figuratively: whether they may not *metonymically* mean *wetting* or *washing;* for these may be the effects of either sprinkling, pouring, or dipping. The question is not whether these words may be used in that way, but whether the action commanded in *baptizo* is sprinkling, pouring, or immersing a person. All authorized Greek dictionaries, ancient and modern, unanimously affirm that action to be immersion, and not sprinkling or pouring.
2. **All Latin, English, German, and French versions that we have seen, and we believe based on the testimony of others, all that we have not seen, sometimes translate these words, their derivatives, or compounds, with words equivalent to *immersion:* but on *no occasion* do they ever translate them as sprinkling, pouring, or any other word equivalent to these terms.** This is significant evidence: for if these versions have been made nineteen times out of twenty by those who practice sprinkling or pouring in the name of the Lord; and if these words occur about one hundred and twenty times in the New Testament, is it not very unusual that never once have such translators rendered the words as sprinkling or pouring? This is, in our judgment, a decisive proof that it could not be translated that way. Indeed, a mere English scholar, who has only heard that *baptism* is a Greek word, can undoubtedly ascertain that it means neither sprinkling nor pouring by substituting the definition of the term and testing its meaning in all places where the ordinance is mentioned. This is an infallible rule of interpretation. *The proper definition of a term substituted for it will always make as much sense as the term itself.* Now, if an English reader tries *sprinkling* or *pouring* in those places where he finds the word *baptism,* he will soon discover that neither of these words can possibly represent it, if the above rule is true. For instance, we are told that all Judea and Jerusalem went out to John and were *baptized* by him in the Jordan. Sprinkled them *in* the Jordan! Poured them *in* the Jordan! Immersed them in the Jordan. Can there be any doubt which of these truly represents the original in such passages? I may sprinkle or pour water upon a person; but to sprinkle or pour them into water is impossible. It is not said he baptized water upon them, but he baptized them in water, in the river.
3. **The ancient church, it is universally acknowledged, practiced immersion.** This is supported by Roman, Greek, and English historians who are considered credible.
4. **The places where baptism was historically administered, being rivers, pools, baths, and places with much water, indicate that it was not sprinkling or pouring.** They went down *into* the water and came up *out* of it, etc. And John baptized where there were many waters or much water. Even Paul and Silas went out of the Philippian jail to baptize the jailer at night, rather than send for a cup of water!
5. **It is also alluded to and explained under the figure of a burial and resurrection, as relating to the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus, etc.** Romans 6 and Colossians 2.

From these topics, many clear and conclusive arguments can be drawn, on which it is not our purpose to elaborate now. If, indeed, any one of these five topics is correct, the action that Christ commands is forever decided. How much more so when they all agree in asserting the same interpretation! There is, then, only one baptism, and not two under the Christian administration.

## The Subject of Baptism

*Characters,* not *persons,* as such, are the subjects of baptism. *Penitent believers* — not infants nor adults, not males nor females, not Jews nor Greeks; but those who profess repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ are the proper subjects of this ordinance. "To as many as received him, to them he granted the privilege of becoming the sons of God, to those who believed in his name, who were born not of flesh, nor of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God." "He who believes and is baptized — not he who is baptized and believes — shall be saved." "Many of the Corinthians hearing, believed and were baptized," not many of the Corinthians were baptized and then believed, and finally heard the Gospel! "For without faith it is impossible to please God," etc.

## The Meaning of Baptism

"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins." "And Jesus said that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." Therefore, Peter said to the penitent Pentecostians, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus, for the remission of sins." Again, "As many of you as have been baptized or immersed into Christ have put on Christ, have been immersed into his death;" "have risen with him."

Baptism is, then, designed to introduce its subjects into the participation of the blessings of the death and resurrection of Christ; who "died for our sins," and "rose again for our justification." But it has no inherent efficacy. Without prior faith in the blood of Christ and deep and sincere repentance before God, neither immersion in water nor any other action can secure for us the blessings of peace and pardon. It can merit nothing. Still, for the believing penitent, it is the *means* of receiving a formal, distinct, and specific absolution, or release from guilt. Therefore, only those who have first believed the testimony of God and have repented of their sins, and who have been intelligently immersed into his death, have the full and explicit testimony of God assuring them of pardon. To such only as are truly penitent, can we say, 'Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord;' and to such only can we confidently say, "You are washed, you are justified, you are sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of God." But let the reader carefully examine our special essay on the Remission of Sins, in which this much-debated subject is discussed at considerable length.

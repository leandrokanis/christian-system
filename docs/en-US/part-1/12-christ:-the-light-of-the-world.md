# 12. Christ: the Light of the World

As Abraham said to Isaac on their way to Mount Moriah, "God," my son, "will provide a lamb for the burnt offering," so it has come to pass. In order to redeem humanity from sin and all its consequences, God has provided a lamb as a sin offering. He sent his Son, who upon entering the world, said, "You did not desire sacrifice and offering, but a body you prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you had no pleasure; then I said, 'Here I am, I have come to do your will, as it is written about me in the scroll.'" But he did more than offer himself as a sin offering; he was more than the Lamb of God; he was the "prophet of the Lord," revealing to humanity the character and will of God. He disclosed secrets hidden since the foundation of the world. In short, he is **the oracle**, as well as the **sacrifice** that God provided for us.

As the **Incarnate Word**, he is the interpreter of his will. The New Testament is, therefore, the gift of Christ â€” written under his guidance and inspiration. Everything the Spirit of God has done has been through his instrumentality. The Spirit is Christ's gift. Jesus is now as much "Lord of the Spirit" as he is the Lord of life and glory. The New Testament is a collection written by his servants. Six of his Apostles and two of his Evangelists wrote it all. That book now serves as a substitute for the personal presence of the Lord and his Apostles. He gave gifts to people after he left their presence. "He gave Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers." As a means of our salvation; as one of the things God has done for us, we place the New Testament, the living oracles, or gospel of Christ, next in importance to his sacrifice.

To the sacrifice of Christ, we always look for the basis of our forgiveness; to his blood that cleanses from all sin, for justification and personal acceptance; and to his Word we look for guidance and instruction in Christian faith and righteousness. We are as dependent on his *Word* for light as we are on his *blood* for forgiveness. "I am," he said, "**the light of the world**; whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the *light of life.*" "In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind." "That was the true light," said John, "that gives light to everyone coming into the world." "As long as I am in the world," says Jesus, "I am the light of the world." Thus Isaiah spoke of him: "I will also give you as a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the ends of the earth." "I will give you as a covenant for the people, a light for the Gentiles, to open blind eyes, to bring out prisoners from the prison, and those who sit in darkness from the prison house." "His going forth is prepared like the morning." "The sun of righteousness will rise with healing in his wings." "I testify," said Paul, "both to small and great, that the Messiah would bring light to the people and to the Gentiles." The Word of Christ is the light of Christ; therefore, the Christian Scriptures are the light of the world; and whoever follows them will have the light of life. "If you continue in my teaching," says the Messiah, "you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." "If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."

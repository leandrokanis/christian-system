# 18. Conversion and Regeneration

The change that is completed by immersion is sometimes referred to in sacred language as "*being quickened,*" or "*made alive,*" "*passing from death to life,*" "*being born again,*" "*having risen with Christ,*" "*turning to the Lord,*" "*being enlightened,*" "*conversion,*" "*reconciliation,*" and "*repentance unto life.*" These terms, like the words propitiation, atonement, reconciliation, expiation, and redemption, express the various aspects of the death of Christ and reflect the different ways this significant change, sometimes called a "new creation," can be understood. The complete transformation brought about in a person by the Christian faith consists of four elements: â€” a change of views; a change of affections; a change of state; and a change of life. Now, regarding each of these individually or in combination, they are referred to by different names. As a change of *views,* it is called "being enlightened;" "Once you were darkness, now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of the light;" "After you were enlightened," etc. As a change of *affections,* it is called "being reconciled;" thus, "for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved through his life." As a change of *state,* it is called "being quickened;" "passing from death to life," "being born again," "having risen with Christ," "And you *he has quickened* who were dead in trespasses and sins," "By this we know we have *passed from death to life,* because we love the brethren," "Being *born again,* not of corruptible, but of incorruptible seed, the word of God, which lives and abides forever." "If you be," or "since you *are risen with Christ,* set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth." As a change of *life,* it is called "repentance unto life," "turning to the Lord," "conversion;" "Then God has granted to the Gentiles repentance to life." "And all who lived in Lydda and Saron saw Eneas and *turned to the Lord.*" "Unless you be converted and become like children, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven." "When you are converted, strengthen your brethren." "He who converts a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins."

Great confusion has been introduced into the Christian community by mixing up these terms, making only one of them mean all the others. Witness the debate about *regeneration;* as if that word were used in sacred Scripture to refer to the entire change brought about by the Christian faith; whereas, in strict accuracy, it is never used by itself in the Bible to represent any part of this change, much less the whole of it. We have the phrase "*washing of regeneration*" once, in contrast to the "renewal of the Holy Spirit," (Titus 3:5) but never by itself as indicative of this four-fold change. But suppose it were conceded that the term *regeneration* might be equivalent to "*being born again,*" it could still only represent so much of this change as pertains to mere *state:* for the metaphor of a new birth applies only to admission into a family or nation, and not to the process of quickening or making alive of the person so admitted. It can, therefore, in strict accuracy, only apply to the fourth part of that change which the gospel of salvation proposes and effects. Being *born again* is, or may be the *effect* of a change of views, of a change of affections; or it may be the *cause* of a change of life; but it is certain that it is not identical with any of them and can never represent them all.

But could it not include them all? It is impossible: for however we might extend the metaphor and suppose it to include its causes, it cannot also include its effects. If it were to include a change of views, a change of affections, and a change of state, it cannot include a change of life or character. We should then use this word in its strict and scriptural sense if we wish to avoid the great confusion now surrounding this topic. The fallacy or delusion of this confusion is that making *regeneration* equivalent to the entire change instead of being one-fourth of it, the community will always be misled by trying to find the attributes of conversion in the new birth, or of the new birth in conversion; and so on with all the others. Being born again is not *conversion,* nor a *change of views,* nor a *change of affections,* but a *change of state.* It is true that for the person who is born again we may assume a change of views, a change of heart, and we may infer a change of character, and may therefore say he is enlightened, renewed in heart, converted as well as born again; but this flexibility regarding the *person,* the subject of the change, is not permitted when discussing the *change* itself. A Christian is, indeed, one whose views are enlightened, whose heart is renewed, whose relationships to God and the moral universe are changed, and whose way of life aligns with righteousness and true holiness.

# 17. The Christian Confession of Faith

The only apostolic and divine confession of faith that God, the Father of all, has established for the church—and the one on which Jesus himself said he would build it—is the sublime and supreme statement: **That Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, the Son of the living God**. This is the distinctive feature of the Christian system: its specific characteristic. The pre-flood Abel, Enoch, and others believed that a Son of Eve would crush Satan's head. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob believed that a special son of theirs would be the child of blessings, the Son of promise to humanity. Indeed, Jesse, David, and all the Prophets looked for one from the royal tribe who would be king of all the earth and a benefactor to humanity. John the Baptist, in his day, preached and believed that the Messenger of the covenant of eternal peace was about to appear. But the disciples of Jesus, son of Mary, believed and confessed that he was that very person. "We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and all the Prophets wrote; Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of David, the King of Israel." "Rabbi," said Nathaniel, "you are the Son of God, you are the King of Israel." Yet it was Peter who fully and explicitly stated the very proposition that contains the whole matter. "We believe and are sure that you are the Messiah, the Son of the living God." "On this rock," Jesus replied, blessing Peter's name and head, "On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it." About this foundation Paul said, "No one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ." God himself laid this cornerstone, this tested and precious stone, as the foundation of the temple of grace; and therefore with his own voice declared him his beloved Son; and confirmed him by the visible descent and impression of his Spirit, as his Messiah, the Messenger of Life and Peace to a condemned and rebellious world.

This confession of faith contains two distinct ideas—one concerning the *person*, the other concerning the *office* of the Son of Man. One asserts his divine nature, the other, his official rank and glory. No one can truly believe this statement without turning to God with all their heart: for it contains countless thoughts and motives to bind the soul to God and melt it into the most affectionate devotion. It also provides the strongest bond to secure the affections of all Christians toward one another. There is no other confession of faith on which the church can be built, on which it can possibly stand united and undivided, but this one. With the heart, a person believes this statement for justification; and with the mouth, they confess it for salvation. This is how Paul explains it in Romans 10; and thus we have one Lord, one faith, and one baptism, among the unchanging reasons why Christians should maintain unity of spirit in the bonds of peace.[^2]

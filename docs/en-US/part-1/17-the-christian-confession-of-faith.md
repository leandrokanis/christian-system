# 17. The Christian Confession of Faith

The only apostolic and divine confession of faith that God, the Father of all, has established for the church—and on which Jesus himself said he would build it—is the profound and ultimate statement: **That Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, the Son of the living God**. This is the unique aspect of the Christian system: its defining characteristic. The pre-flood Abel, Enoch, and others believed that a Son of Eve would crush Satan's head. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob believed that a special son of theirs would be the child of blessings, the Son of promise to humanity. Indeed, Jesse, David, and all the Prophets looked for one from the royal tribe who would be king of all the earth and a benefactor to humanity. John the Baptist, in his time, preached and believed that the Messenger of the covenant of eternal peace was about to appear. But the disciples of Jesus, son of Mary, believed and confessed that he was the very person. "We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and all the Prophets wrote; Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of David, the King of Israel." "Rabbi," said Nathaniel, "you are the Son of God, you are the King of Israel." Yet it was Peter who fully and explicitly spoke the very statement that encompasses the whole matter: "We believe and are sure that you are the Messiah, the Son of the living God." "On this rock," he replied, blessing Peter's name and head: "On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it." Of this foundation, Paul has said, "no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ." God himself laid this cornerstone, this tested and precious stone, as the foundation of the temple of grace; and therefore with his own lips declared him his beloved Son; and confirmed him by the visible descent and impression of his Spirit, as his Messiah, the Messenger of Life and Peace to a condemned and rebellious world.

This confession of faith contains two distinct ideas—the one concerning the *person*, the other concerning the *office* of the Son of Man. The first asserts his divine relationships, while the second addresses his official rank and glory. No one can genuinely believe this statement and not turn to God with all their heart; for within it are countless thoughts and motivations to bind the soul to God and inspire the deepest devotion. It also provides the strongest bond to secure the affections of all Christians to one another. There is no other confession of faith on which the church can be built, on which it can possibly stand united and undivided, except this one. With the heart, a person believes this statement for justification; and with their mouth, they make this confession for salvation. As Paul explains it in Romans 10, we have one Lord, one faith, and one baptism, among the unchanging reasons why Christians should maintain unity of spirit in the bonds of peace.[^2]

# 4. Physical Regeneration

Our mortal bodies have yet to experience the regenerating power of the Son of God. This is emphatically referred to as '*the glory of his power.*' 'The redemption of the body' from the bondage of corruption is the culmination of the new creative energy of Him who possesses immortality. Life and incorruptibility were revealed in and through His resurrection from the dead. It was significant to create man in the image of God — even greater to redeem his soul from universal corruption; but the greatest of all is to grant his mortal frame incorruptible and immortal strength. The power demonstrated in giving the dead body of the Son of God incorruptible glory and eternal life is described by the Apostle Paul as incomparably surpassing every other divine work within human understanding. He prays that the minds of Christians may be expanded to grasp this mighty power — that the Father of glory would enlighten their minds, 'so that they may know the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us who believe — according to the working of His mighty power, which He accomplished in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places.' Faith in this extraordinary work of God — hope for the riches of the glory of the inheritance of the saints in light — are among the most powerful motivators that God has ever instilled in the human heart. This is the transcendent hope of the Christian calling, which has inspired such heroic courage in all the saints of eternal renown. This better resurrection in view has produced heroes that make cowards of all the celebrated leaders of worldly glory. Just as the magnetic needle always points to the pole, so the mind, influenced by this hope, continually rises to the skies, culminating in the fullness of joy and eternal pleasures in the presence and at the right hand of God.

To raise a dead body to life again is not presented as more glorious than, with a touch, giving new strength to a paralyzed arm, restoring sight to the blind, or hearing to the deaf; but to grant that raised body the deathless strength of incorruptibility, to renew and transform it in all its parts, and to make every spirit aware that it reanimates its own body, that it is as impervious to decay as immortal as the Father of eternity, is a thought overwhelming to every mind, a revelation that will glorify the power of God, just as the sacrifice of His Son now displays His righteousness, faithfulness, and love to heaven and earth.

This new birth from the dark prison of the grave is aptly called 'the redemption of the body' from bondage, '*the glorious liberty of the children of God.*' Just as in our watery grave the old self is symbolically buried to rise no more, so in the literal grave, the prison of the body, we leave behind all that is corrupt; for He who makes all things new will raise us up in His own likeness and present us before His Father's face in all the glory of immortality. Then regeneration will be complete. Then will come the full revelation of the children of God.

Immortality, in the sacred writings, is never applied to the spirit of man. It is not the doctrine of Plato that the resurrection of Jesus proposes. It is the *immortality of the body* of which His resurrection is a proof and promise. This was never revealed until He became the firstborn from the dead and entered heaven in a human body. Jesus was not a spirit when He returned to God. He is not made the Head of the New Creation as a Spirit, but as the Son of Man. Our nature in His person is glorified; and when He appears for our salvation, we shall be made like Him: we shall see Him as He is. This is the Christian hope.

- A hope so great and so divine

  May trials well endure,

  And purge the soul from sense and sin,  As Christ himself is pure."

Thus matters stand in the economy of redemption. Thus the divine scheme of regeneration is fulfilled: the moral aspect, through the operation of moral means; the physical aspect, through the mighty power of God working through physical means. By the word of His power, He created the heavens and the earth; by the word of His grace, He reanimates the soul of man; and by the word of His power, He will again form our bodies anew and reunite the spirit and the body in the bonds of an incorruptible and everlasting union. Then shall death "be swallowed up forever" "*Where now is your victory, boasting grave?*" But for this, we must wait. 'We do not know what we shall be.' We only know that when He appears, we shall be like Him; that we shall see Him as He is.

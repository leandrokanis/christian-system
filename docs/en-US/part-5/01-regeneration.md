# 1. Regeneration

- "I create new heavens and a new earth." Isa 65:18.
- "Behold, I make all things new." Rev. 21:5.

We intend to write an essay on "the seeds of things." The topic is common, familiar, and yet interesting. Much has been said and written about it; and still, it is not better understood than it should be. Few take the time to think deeply about the things they believe they understand, and many would rather follow the thoughts of others than think for themselves. Suspense is painful, and much study can be exhausting; therefore, most people are content with the views and opinions handed down to them from those who have come before.

We want to approach this subject as if it were new and examine it now as if we had never looked at it before. It deserves that attention. Generation is full of wonders, showcasing God's physical grandeur; yet regeneration is even more remarkable, as it reveals the moral attributes of God. However, our goal is not to explore its wonders but to provide a straightforward, sensible, scriptural explanation of its significance.

We have not learned our theology from Athanasius, nor our morality from Seneca; therefore, we will not call upon them for illustration, argument, or proof. We look to the Sacred Records, where Christianity remains fresh, for insight; and we direct our readers' attention there. We will not write about the regeneration of the schools, where Christianity has been diminished, misunderstood, obscured, and corrupted, but about the regeneration that Jesus spoke of and the Apostles wrote about.

A few things must be established — a few general views expressed — before we or our readers are ready for the more detailed aspects. To approach the subject without unnecessary delay, we note that —

Unregenerate man is ruined in body, soul, and spirit; a fragile and mortal being. From Adam, his father, he inherits a broken constitution. He is the child of a fallen ancestor; a descendant from a degenerate lineage.

No descendant can surpass Adam, the exile from Eden, in physical, intellectual, and moral nature. It is not in human nature to improve itself; for the stream cannot rise above its source. Cain, the firstborn of Eve, was in nature the image and likeness of his father. Education failed to improve him, while Abel, his younger brother, received the excellence that faith in God's promise alone provides. It will be conceded that the firstborn was at least equal to his younger brother; and who can argue that he excels Eve's eldest son in nature?

However, man in his ruined state is a suitable subject for a remedial system. He is capable of renewal. Therefore, God has placed him under a regenerating economy. This economy aims at the regeneration of the entire human constitution and proposes as its goal the transformation of spirit, soul, and body. The destiny of the regenerate is described by Paul in one sentence: "As we now bear the image of the earthly Adam, we shall then bear the image of the heavenly Adam."

God's own Son is presented as a model. Conformity to Him in glory, honor, and immortality, as the perfection of the regenerate, is the predestination of the one who speaks of things that are not as though they were.

Regeneration is, therefore, both moral and physical: in other words, there is currently a renewal of the mind — of understanding, will, and affections; — and there will be a future renewal of the body: "For this corruptible body shall put on incorruption, and this mortal body shall put on immortality."

The renewal of the mind and character is, therefore, that moral regeneration which is to be accomplished in this life; for which the remedial system, or kingdom of heaven, was established on earth; and this, therefore, demands our attention first and foremost.

Before we attempt to answer the question, _How is this moral regeneration accomplished?_ we will consider the principle on which the entire remedial system operates. The grand principle, or means that God has adopted for achieving this moral regeneration, is the full demonstration and proof of a single proposition addressed to the reason of man. This profound proposition is, **that God is love**.

The reason and wisdom of this approach will be clear to anyone who can understand the views and feelings of all unregenerate people. A person in a state of alienation and rebellion naturally suspects that if he is a sinner, and if God hates sin, then God must hate him. As love begets love, so hatred begets hatred; and if a sinner suspects that God hates him, he cannot love God. He must know that God loves him before he can begin to love God. "We," says an Apostle, "love God because he first loved us." While alienated in heart, through the native darkness of his understanding, the sinner misinterprets every restraint that God has placed in his way to prevent his total ruin as indications of divine wrath. His transgression of these restraints, and his awareness of having defied the truth and power of God, only increase his enmity and push him further into his apostasy and distance from his Creator. The goodness of God, being misunderstood, provides him no incentive for repentance and reformation. Guilt, fear, and shame, the fruits of his apostasy, cloud his understanding and obscure from his eyes all the demonstrations of benevolence and goodness that creation abounds with. Adam hiding under a tree, trembling with fear, suspicious of the movements of every leaf, and covered with shame as a garment, is both an illustration and proof of the state of mind that exists in the unregenerate.

Neither the volume of creation nor that of God's providence is sufficient to remove from the natural man these misconceptions and the resulting alienation of heart. The best proof that these two volumes cannot do this is that they have never, in any instance, succeeded in doing so. From the nature of things, it is evident that they cannot do it. The elements often conflict with human happiness. The ever-changing state of the natural world concerning health, life, and comfort makes it doubtful whether the laws of nature, which ultimately lead man to the grave, are the result of benevolence or malevolence toward humanity. A third volume that explains both, and is also filled with supernatural revelations, is needed to provide the most diligent student of nature and providence with the means to learn the true and complete character of the one against whom we have rebelled.

That volume is the Bible. Holy prophets and apostles spoke as they were moved by the Spirit of Knowledge and Revelation. Its records, history, prophecy, precepts, laws, ordinances, and examples all reveal God to man and man to himself.

But it is in the person and mission of the **Incarnate Word** that we learn that _God is love_. That God gave his Son for us, and yet gives his Spirit to us — and this gives us himself — are the mysterious and transcendent proofs of the most profound proposition in the universe. The gospel, Heaven's wisdom and power combined, God's own means for the renewal of human nature, is nothing more or less than the illustration and proof of this regenerating proposition.

Thus we move on to our subject. Having glanced at the great landmarks of the plantations of nature and grace, we will now, in the light of truth, ascertain the true and divinely taught doctrine of regeneration, and we will carefully survey the entire process as developed by the commissioned teachers of the deep counsels of the only true God.

The certain aspects of this great process may be well understood, and certain terms that we commonly use to represent them must be well defined and accurately understood. These terms are **Fact, Testimony, Faith, Repentance, Reformation, Bath of Regeneration, New Birth, Renewing of the Holy Spirit, Newness of Life.**^1

"All things are of God" in the regeneration of man is our motto; because our Apostle affirmed this as a fundamental truth. He is the author of the *facts* and of the *testimony* that declares them; and being the author of these, he is the author of all the effects produced by these facts. The Christian is a new *creation,* of which God is the *Creator*. The change of heart and character that constitutes moral regeneration is the legitimate result of the facts, or things that God has accomplished. The facts constitute the moral seal that stamps the image of God upon man. In the natural order, we must place them first, and therefore, we must first define the term.

## Repentance

Repentance is usually defined as *sorrow for anything that is past;* and in religious terms, it is simply *sorrow for sin*. This is one definition, but it is only one of the natural effects of believing the testimony of God. The gospel facts, testimony, and faith encompass more than this. However, it is necessary that this point of faith be clearly understood, especially in this age, when it occupies such a significant place in theological systems.

Repentance, in our current understanding, is sorrow for sin; and certainly, there is no one who believes the revealed facts found in the testimony of God who will not feel sorry for his sins. But simple sorrow for the past is merely a feeling of the heart; which, unless it leads to reformation or the abandonment of sin, is of no more use than the regrets of Judas after he sold his Master for thirty pieces of silver. Repentance must, however, precede reformation; for unless we are sorry for the past and grieved with ourselves, we will not think of changing our conduct. Repentance is to reformation what motive is to action, or resolution to any undertaking. It was good for David to resolve to build the temple; and so it is good to form any good intention; but it is much better to execute it. To feel sorry for the poor and the afflicted, and to resolve to assist and comfort them, is good; but to go and do it is better: and indeed, unless our sorrow for the past leads to reformation for the future, it is useless in the eyes of heaven and earth; as useless as saying to the hungry, "Be filled;" or to the naked, "Be clothed."
Genuine repentance does not always lead to reformation. Judas was sorrowful even to death, but he could not change. Many have been genuinely sorry for their sins to the point of taking their own lives. Are we speaking of "a godly sorrow?" No: this cannot be expected from unconverted and ungodly people. Christians, as Paul teaches, may repent with a godly sorrow when they err; but this is not to be expected from the unregenerate or from those who have not changed. It is not, then, the genuineness of repentance that should be appreciated, unless by genuine repentance we mean more than simple sorrow for the past—unless by genuine repentance we mean reformation. Yet without sincere or genuine repentance, there cannot be real or genuine reformation.

This leads us to observe that the only clear evidence of sincere repentance is the actual redress of the injury done; not only a cessation from the sin but also restitution for the sin, as far as restitution can possibly be made. _No restitution, no repentance—provided restitution can be made_. And I may add, _that without repentance and restitution, when possible, there can be no forgiveness_.

The preachers of repentance—the necessity of repentance for forgiveness—should present this matter clearly and fully to sinners. Do they represent repentance as sorrow for the past and a determination to change? How then will the sinner know that he is sorry for his sins against others, or how will the community know that he has repented of such sins unless full restitution is made? It is impossible for either the sinner himself or the community who know his sins against others to have any certain evidence that he is penitent unless he makes all possible restitution.

Peccator wounded the reputation of his neighbor Hermas and, on another occasion, defrauded him of ten pounds. Some in the neighborhood were aware that he had done both. Peccator was converted under the preaching of Paulinus and, in sharing his sorrow for his sins, spoke of the depth of his convictions and his abhorrence of his wrongdoing. He was received into the congregation and sat down with the faithful to commemorate the great sin offering. Hermas and his neighbors witnessed all this. They saw that Peccator was penitent and had greatly changed his behavior; but they could not believe him sincere because he had made no restitution. They regarded him either as a hypocrite or self-deceived because, having the means, he did not repay the ten pounds nor once contradicted the slanders he had spread. Peccator, however, felt little joy in his profession and soon fell back into his former habits. He became penitent again, and upon examining the reasons for his falling away, he discovered that he had never truly turned away from his sins. Overwhelmed with sorrow for the past, he resolved to give himself to the Lord; and reflecting on his past life, he earnestly set about the work of reformation. He visited Hermas, paid him the ten pounds, along with interest for every day he had withheld it, went to all the people he had slandered, told them about the injustice he had done, and asked them to contradict it if they had shared it with anyone else. He also visited several others he had wronged in his dealings and fully addressed all these wrongs against his neighbors. He confessed them to the Lord and asked for forgiveness. Peccator was then restored to the church; and even better, he enjoyed a peace of mind and a confidence in God that was a continual source of joy. His example, moreover, did more to grow the congregation at the Crossroads than the preaching of Paulinus did in an entire year. This was, without a doubt, _sincere_ repentance.

This is the repentance that Moses preached and which Jesus approved. Under the law, confession to the priest and presenting a trespass offering meant nothing for forgiveness without restitution. But the law went into even more detailed provisions than these; for there was a provision for cases where the sinner could not find the person they had wronged. In such cases, the penitent sinner was to seek out the relatives of the injured party, and if they could find any relative, they were to compensate this relative; but if they could not find a relative, they must compensate it to the Lord, in addition to offering their trespass offering. It was to go into the Lord's treasury. The principle uniformly applied in all cases of sin against others was that the sinner "shall make amends for the harm he has done, and shall add a fifth part to it."

If anyone thinks that repentance is to be less sincere or clear under the gospel, let them remember that Zaccheus proposed more than adding a fifth; he would restore fourfold, and Jesus approved him for doing so. Indeed, John the Immerser demanded fruits worthy of repentance or reformation, and Paul proclaimed that those who turned to God should do works fitting for, or worthy of, repentance.

"Works worthy of repentance" is a phrase that can only be understood as those works that make amends for the harm done to others and the dishonor done to God, as far as both are possible. Can anyone think that they are sorry for the sin or wrong they have done when they make no effort to make amends to the person who was harmed in their person, character, or property? Works worthy of their professed repentance are lacking as long as any person they have harmed in person, property, or reputation remains unaddressed to the fullest extent of their ability.

One of our most popular commentators says—and with much truth—"No one should expect mercy from God if they have wronged their neighbor and refuse, when they have the ability, to make *restitution*. Even if they weep tears of blood, both the justice and mercy of God would shut out their prayer if they do not make amends to their neighbor for the injury they have done. They are dishonest if they illegally hold the property of another in their hands."

Every preacher of repentance should insist on these evidences of sincerity for the satisfaction of the penitent themselves and for the good of the community. "Many who believed came and confessed, and showed their deeds; many of them also, who practiced curious arts, brought their books together and burned them before everyone; and they calculated the value of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver." This was making restitution, in their case, as far as possible; and the principle here demonstrated is applicable in every other case.

But in pursuing this subject so far, we have crossed the boundaries of repentance and sometimes confused it with reformation. This is due to the careless use of language, to which modern theology has greatly contributed. We shall, however, correct this misunderstanding as much as possible with a few remarks on

## Reformation

The word *metanoia*, used by the sacred writers and heaven-taught preachers of the New Economy, as indicative of the first effect of faith, as has been often shown, is different from what our word *repentance* properly represents. It literally means *a change of mind*; but, as Parkhurst, Campbell, and many others say, "such a change of mind as influences one's subsequent behavior for the better." "It has been observed by some, and I think with reason, that the former (*metanoeo*) properly denotes a change for the better: the latter (*metamelomai*) merely denotes a change, whether for the better or worse; that the former marks a change of mind that is lasting and produces consequences; the latter expresses only a present uneasy feeling of regret, without regard to duration or effects: in short, that the first may be translated into English as *I reform*; the second, *I repent*, in the common understanding of the words." Now, since everyone who reforms *repents*; but not everyone who repents *reforms*, this distinction is necessary and proper; and there is nothing at stake, nothing lost by translating the former as *I reform*, and the latter as *I repent*. There is something gained, especially in all instances where we have the word in the imperative mood, because then it is important to know precisely what is intended. If we are commanded only to change our mind or to feel sorry for the past, we have obeyed when we feel regret; but if more than mere change of mind or regret is intended, we have not obeyed the command until we change for the better. Now it is, I think, very evident from various passages of the sacred writings of the Apostles and from their speeches that they commanded more than a simple change of mind regarding past conduct or mere sorrow for the past. Peter commanded the thousands assembled on the day of Pentecost, who had changed their minds and who were sorry for the past, to do something they had not yet done; and that something is rendered in the common version as *repent*; in the new version as *reform*; and in the old English Bible as *amend your lives*. The word here used is the imperative of *metanoeo*. Judas repented, and many like him, who never reformed; and therefore, it is important to keep this distinction in mind.

Repentance is not reformation, but it is necessary for it; for whoever reforms must first repent. Reformation is, indeed, the carrying out of the purpose into our conduct. But since reformation belongs more to another part of our discussion than the present, we shall pause here and offer a few reflections.

In the preceding definition of words and ideas, it would appear that we have a literal and straightforward representation of the whole process of what is figuratively called *regeneration*. For, as we shall soon see, the term *regeneration* is a figure of speech that very appropriately, though analogically, represents the reformation or renewal of life of which we have now spoken.
That the preceding arrangement is not arbitrary, but natural and necessary, the reader will understand when he reflects that the action or the fact must come before the report or testimony about it; that the testimony must come before the belief in it; that belief in the testimony must come before any feelings that correspond with the fact testified; and that feeling must come before action in accordance with it. Fact, testimony, faith, feeling, and action are therefore connected by a natural and gracious necessity that no cleverness can separate. And will not every Christian agree that when a person *feels* and *acts* according to the faith, or the testimony of God, he is a new creation — regenerated — truly converted to God? The one who believes the facts testified in the record of God, understands them, feels in accordance with their nature and meaning, and acts in harmony with them — has experienced a change of heart and life that makes him a new person.

This is that moral change of heart and life, which is figuratively called *regeneration*. We should not assume that regeneration is something that must be added to the faith, the feeling, and the action or behavior, which are the effects of the testimony of God understood and embraced; or which are the impression of the divine facts attested by Prophets and Apostles. It is simply another name for the same process in all its parts.

It may also be noted that many figures and analogies are used by the inspired writers to illustrate this change, as well as other key truths and lessons in the Bible. Collectively, Christians are called a kingdom, a nation, a generation, a family, a house, a flock, a city, a temple, a priesthood, etc. Individually, they are called kings, priests, soldiers, citizens, children, sheep, branches, stones, etc. They are said to be begotten, born, regenerated, built, grafted, converted, created, and planted. Now, under whatever figure they are considered or introduced, reason suggests that everything said of them should be expressed in accordance with the figure under which they are presented. Are they called *sheep?* — then the one who oversees them is called a *Shepherd*; their enemies are *wolves* and *dogs*; their nourishment is the *green pasture*; their place of safety and rest is the *sheepfold*; their mistakes are *wanderings* and *strayings*; their conversion is a *return*; and their good behavior is a *hearing of the voice,* or a *following* of the Shepherd. Are they called *children?* — then collectively they are a *family*; they are *begotten* and *born again*; God is their *Father*; their separation is an *adoption*; Jesus is their *elder brother*; they are *heirs* of God; they *live* and *walk* with God. Are they *priests?* — Jesus is their *High Priest*; the church is their *temple*; the Savior is their *altar*; their songs and praises are *incense* rising to heaven; and their gifts to the poor, their acts of love, are *sacrifices* most acceptable to God. Are they called *citizens?* — then the church is *the kingdom of heaven; Jerusalem is the mother of them all*; previously they were *aliens,* and their naturalization is *regeneration*. Are they called *branches?* — then Jesus is the *true vine*; his Father is the *vine dresser*; their union with Christ is an *engrafting*; the discipline of the gospel is a *pruning*; and their good works are *fruits of righteousness*.

Thus there is no confusion of metaphor in the Scriptures of truth — in the language of heaven. It is the language of Ashdod; it belongs to the confusion of Babel to mix and confuse all figures and analogies. Hence we often hear of *being born again,* without any reference to a family or a kingdom! and of *regeneration* as preceding faith or repentance! If a modern assembly of theologians had been tasked with adapting the scripture style to their orthodox beliefs, we would not have had to read all of the Old Testament and all the historical books of the New to find the subject of regeneration proposed to an outsider, as is the case; but we would have found it in the history of Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham, if not in every section of the law of Moses, in the Prophets, and in the Psalms. John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Holy Twelve would have included it in every sermon; and true faith would have always been defined as the result of regeneration.

But Jesus had a *kingdom* in mind and in his discourse before he ever mentioned being 'born again' to Nicodemus; for unless there was a family, a state, or a kingdom to be born into, it is impossible for anyone to be born into it. And if the kingdom of heaven only began after Jesus entered into heaven; or if it was only approaching from the ministry of John to the day of Pentecost, then it would have been absurd — an incongruity of which no inspired person was ever guilty — to call any change of heart or life, *a regeneration,* or *a new birth*. It is true that good people in all ages were made such by facts, testimony, faith, and feeling, by a change of heart, by the Spirit of God; but the *analogy* or *figure* of being *born,* or of being *regenerated,* only began to be preached when people began to press into it.

We are now, perhaps, better prepared to consider the proper import and meaning of '*regeneration*' in general, and of '*the bath of regeneration*' in particular.

## Regeneration

This word is found only twice in all the oracles of God — once in Matt. 19:28 and once in Titus 3:5. In the former, it is almost universally understood to mean *a new state of things,* not of *persons* — a unique era in which all things are made new: — such as the formation of a new church on the day of Pentecost, or the beginning of the Millennium, or the general resurrection. The biblical scholars of note have assigned it to one or the other of these great changes in the state of things. So we use the word *revolution,* and the phrase *the Revolution,* to express a change in the political state of affairs. The most accepted punctuation and version of this passage makes it clear that a new era is being referenced. 'Jesus answered, Truly, I say to you, that at the renewal when the Son of Man shall be seated on his glorious throne, you, my followers, sitting also upon twelve thrones, shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel.' This being so evident, and so often referenced in our previous writings, we shall proceed to the remaining occurrence, Titus 3:5.

All the new insights we propose to shed on this passage will be gathered from an examination of the meaning of the word *generation* in the sacred writings. Our reason for this is that we object to a definitive decision on the meaning of a word that occurs only in the passage under discussion, based on our reasoning about the isolated passages in which it is found. In such a case, if we cannot find the whole word in any parallel passages, the proper substitute is the root or branches of that word, as far as they are used by the same writers. Moreover, we think it will be agreed that, whatever may be the scriptural meaning of the word *generation,* regeneration is simply the repetition of that act or process.

After a close examination of the passages in which *generation* occurs in the writings of the Hebrew Prophets and Apostles, we find it used only in two meanings — as descriptive of the whole process of creation and of the thing created. A race of people, or a particular class of people, is called a *generation*; but this is its figurative, rather than its literal meaning. Its literal meaning is the formation or creation of anything. Thus it is first used in the Holy Scriptures. Moses calls the creation, or whole process of formation of the heavens and the earth, 'The *generations* of the heavens and the earth.' The account of the formation of Adam and Eve, and also the account of the creations of Adam and Eve, are, by the same writer, called 'The book or record of the *generations* of Adam.' This is the literal meaning of the word; consequently, *regeneration* literally indicates the whole process of renewing or recreating man.

This process may consist of many distinct acts; but it is in accordance with general usage to give the name of the whole process to the beginning or final act. For the most part, however, the name of the whole process is given to the final act, because the process is always assumed to be incomplete until that act is performed. For example: In the process of tanning, fulling, forging, etc., the subject of these operations is not considered to be tanned, fulled, forged, until the last act is performed. So in all the processes of nature — in the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, the last act completes the process. To all familiar with the process of animalization, germination, crystallization, etc., no further argument is needed. But in the language of our American farmers, no crop or animal is *made,* until it reaches maturity. We often hear them say of a good rain, or a few clear days, "This is the *making* of the wheat or corn." In the same sense, most Christians call *regeneration* **the new birth**; though *being born* is only the last act in natural generation, and the last act in regeneration.

In this way, the *new birth* and *regeneration* are used interchangeably by commentators and writers on theology, and by a figure of speech, it is justified on well-established principles of rhetoric. This leads us to speak particularly of (the next chapter)

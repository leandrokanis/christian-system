# 5. The Use of the Theory of Regeneration

One might imagine, from the extensive arguments, debates, and sermons about the theory of regeneration, that a sound theory was essential for salvation: that it must be preached in every sermon to regenerate the listeners. Nothing could be more absurd. Who would think that any theory of the resurrection or regeneration of the body could affect the body in the grave? Just as little can any theory affect the unregenerate, or those dead in trespasses and sins. A sermon about generation, or natural birth, would be just as effective on those unborn in bringing them into this life as a sermon about moral or physical regeneration. This explains the fact that in all the accounts of apostolic preaching to Jews and Gentiles—in all the excerpts of their sermons and speeches found in the New Testament—the subject of regeneration is not once mentioned. It is, in all the historical books of the New Testament, proposed but once, mentioned but once; and that only in a private conversation with a Jewish official about the affairs of Christ's kingdom. No theory understood or believed by the unregenerate; no theory offered to them for their acceptance, can do anything to their regeneration. We might as reasonably give a theory of digestion to a dyspeptic to cure his stomach—or a theory of plant growth to a cutting to speed its growth—as preach any view of regeneration to a sinner to make him a Christian.

Of what use, then, are the previous remarks on this subject? I will first honestly inform the reader that they were not written for his regeneration, either of mind or body; but for the benefit of those who are engaged in the work of regenerating others, and to convince those Christians who may have been led to think we aim at nothing but the mere immersion of persons as the only necessary part of the whole process of conversion or regeneration, in their understanding of the words. The use of this theory, if it has any, is as a guide for those who are working publicly or privately for the regeneration of sinners. If we have assigned a proper place to facts, testimony, faith, feeling, action, the bath of regeneration, the renewing of the Holy Spirit, and a new life, the path is clearly marked out. They are to present the great facts, to declare the full testimony of God to sinners, for their conversion or regeneration. Like Paul, in his account of his work in Corinth, they must go out not in the strength of human philosophy, "*but declaring the testimony of God,*" and laying before their listeners "the wonderful works of God."

This is the use, and the only proper use, of sound theory on any subject. It is to guide the operator, not the thing being operated on. I would hope, under the Divine blessing, to be the means of regenerating more people in one year without ever mentioning regeneration or speculating on the subject, by stating and enforcing the testimony of God, than by preaching daily the most approved theory of regeneration ever endorsed by any council on earth. With these views, we have offered the preceding remarks; and will now briefly turn our attention to (the next chapter)

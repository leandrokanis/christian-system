# 8. A Word to the Moral Regenerators of Any Age

God, our heavenly Father, works through means, as we all acknowledge. His means are wisely suited to the ends he has in mind. His agents are the best suited for the work he has to accomplish. He does not use physical means or agents for moral ends and purposes. Nor does he produce physical effects through moral means and agents. He has chosen to employ not angels, but humans in the work of regenerating the world. People have written, printed, and published the gospel for nearly two thousand years. They have passed it down from generation to generation. They have translated it from language to language and carried it from country to country. They have preached it in word and deed, and thus it has come down to our time.

During the current administration of the reign of Heaven, no change is to be expected; no new mission is to be started, no new order of preachers is to be established. The King has gone to a distant country; and before his departure, he gathered his servants and entrusted them with the management of his estate until he returns. He has not yet come to hold them accountable. They were commanded first to proclaim the doctrine of his reign; then to write it in a book and to pass it on to faithful individuals who would be able to teach it accurately to others. Through these faithful individuals, the records have been preserved; and through their vigilance and hard work, they have been protected from corruption, interpolation, and change. One generation handed them over to the next; and if ignorant and unfaithful copyists neglected their duty, others more faithful have corrected them; and now we are able to hear the words that Jesus spoke and to read the very sentences written by the Apostles.

Thus, whatever the Prophets and the Apostles have achieved since their death has been accomplished by human agents like ourselves. Where people have not carried this knowledge in speech or writing, not one of our race knows God or his anointed Savior. No angel or Holy Spirit has been sent to the pagan nations: and God has exerted no power outside of his word to enlighten or reclaim savage nations. These undeniable facts and truths have significant moral implications and should strongly motivate our efforts to regenerate the world.

The best means of doing this is the focus now before us; and this is one whose importance cannot be easily overstated. There are three approaches to this matter that currently seem to occupy a considerable share of public attention. These are properly called *theorizing, declaiming,* and *preaching;* on each of which we may offer a remark or two in passing.

The *theorizers* are those who are always speculating about correct notions or the true theory of conversion. They are great masters of method, and for some of them, it is a serious error to place faith before regeneration or repentance after faith. Heresy, for these individuals, is the disruption of the method they propose for God to work by in converting the sinner. And the true faith that is connected with salvation is an understanding of this theory and agreement with it. These are all theorists, headstrong, or speculative Christians; and for them, the whole *scheme* of redemption is a grand theory.

Our maxim is, *Theory for the Doctors, and medicine for the sick.* Doctors thrive on theories, but patients die who depend on theory for healing. A few grains of practice are worth a pound of theory. The mason and the carpenter *build* the house by *rule;* but he who inhabits it *lives* by *eating* and *drinking.* No one has ever been cured physically, politically, morally, or religiously by learning a correct theory of their physical, political, moral, or religious ailment. As soon might we expect to heal an ulcer on the liver by a lecture on that organ, its functions, its diseases, and their cures, as to restore a sinner through the theory of faith, repentance, regeneration, or effective calling. But enough has already been said on this topic, and more than is necessary to convince those who can think and who dare to reason on such matters.

The *declaimers* are not only those who praise virtue and condemn vice; but that large and respectable group who appeal to the passions, hopes, and fears of people. They are those who are so rhetorical about the joys of heaven and the terrors of hell: who horrify, terrify, and entice through the strength of their descriptions, the inflections of their voices, the intensity of their gestures, and their moving anecdotes. Their listeners are either moved to tears or filled with terror. These individuals talk a lot about the heart; and, according to their theory, if a person's heart were removed, all their religion would be removed with it. The religion of their converts flows in their blood and is rooted in their passions.

The *preachers,* properly so called, first address themselves to the understanding, by declaring or narrating the wonderful works of God. They state, illustrate, and prove the great facts of the gospel; they lay the entire record before their listeners; and when they have testified to what God has done, what he has promised and threatened, they urge their listeners on these grounds and persuade them to obey the gospel, to surrender themselves to the guidance and direction of the Son of God. They address the whole person: their understanding, will, and affections, and approach the heart by taking the stronghold of the understanding.

The skilled and wise proclaimer of the word will always find it beneficial to address his audience in their proper character; to approach them through their biases, and never to criticize these preconceptions, which are not directly opposed to the meaning and purpose of the ministry of reconciliation. He will present the models found in sacred history, which show that the same message is not to be preached in every place and to every assembly, even when it is necessary to proclaim the same gospel. Paul's addresses to the Athenians, Lycaonians, Antiochians, to Felix, the Jailor, and King Agrippa are full of instruction on this topic.

Augustine has written a treatise on preaching, which Luther used as a model; but it is said that Augustine fell as far short of his own precepts as did any of his contemporaries. We all can more easily give advice to others than conform to it ourselves. In Augustine's treatise, which in some respects influenced and shaped the style and plan of Luther, and through him all the Protestants, there is much said on the best rhetorical way "of presenting the truth to others;" but it leans more toward the art of the schoolmen than the wisdom of the Apostles. He focuses more on the best style and method of expressing oneself than on the content to be conveyed.

Our best guidance in this matter comes more from the books of Deuteronomy and Nehemiah than from any other source outside the New Testament. The book of Deuteronomy can be seen as a series of sermons or discourses delivered to the Jews by their great teacher, Moses, rather than as a part of Jewish history. Two things in this book deserve significant attention. The first is the simplicity, completeness, and detail of his narratives of the events during the journey through the wilderness; — God's actions and theirs, for the last forty years, are faithfully and clearly presented to them. The second is the use made of these facts; the conclusions drawn, the arguments presented, and the exhortations offered based on these facts. For a fair and beautiful example of this, let the curious reader take up and carefully read the first four chapters of the book of Deuteronomy. The fact and the application, the argument and the exhortation in the manner of Moses, cannot fail to instruct him.

The writings of the scribes during the captivity teach us how to address a people that have lost the true meaning of the oracles of God. The readings, expositions, exhortations, and prayers of Ezra and Nehemiah are full of instruction for Christians in these days of Babylonish captivity. Addressing a people long accustomed to hearing the Scriptures, yet ignorant of them, and consequently disobedient, is a task that requires all the wisdom and prudence that can be gained from Jewish and Christian records.

The manner of address, next to the content, is most important. The weightiest arguments, the most solemn appeals, the most heartfelt expostulations, if not supported by the gravity, sincerity, and piety of the speaker, will be like water spilled on the ground. A little levity, a few jokes, a sarcastic tone, a conceited posture, or a harsh expression can often neutralize all the strengths of the most scriptural and edifying discourse. The great work of regenerating people is too serious, too profoundly grave and divine, to allow anything of the sort. Humility, calmness, devotion, and all benevolence in demeanor, as well as in language, are essential for a successful proclamation of the great facts of the Living Oracles. He who can smile in his discourse at the follies need not weep over the misfortunes of the ignorant and superstitious. He who can, while preaching the gospel, mock and ridicule the errors of his fellow believers is, for the time being, unfit to persuade them to accept the truth or gladly receive the message of salvation.

Those preachers have been sadly mistaken who have sought popularity through eccentricities and courted smiles rather than souls; — who, through their anecdotes and foolish jokes, told with the Bible before them, have thought to make themselves useful by making themselves ridiculous — and to regenerate people by teaching them how to violate the precepts of the gospel and to disregard the examples of the Great Teacher and his Apostles.

It will not work. These are the weapons of this world, and no part of the armor of light. Jesus and his Apostles never endorsed, by precept or example, such a course; and it is condemned by all sensible people, whether Jews or Gentiles, believers or non-believers.
In trying to regenerate people, we must present the new person, not the old person, both in the preacher and in the message; and while we look for arguments to convince and attract them, we must demonstrate in our speech and actions that we believe what we preach. The Apostles and Evangelists did the same. They appealed to every person's conscience in the sight of Jesus Christ.

Error must be confronted. It must be opposed by the truth. However, one might ask whether darkness can be more easily dispelled by introducing light rather than through detailed discussions about its nature and characteristics. The same applies to moral darkness or error. To effectively dispel it, the simplest and most direct method is to introduce the light of truth. No preacher is required to learn all the errors of all ages to be able to oppose them; nor does the congregation gain knowledge of God through such discussions of error. Current opposing errors may need attention; however, to successfully confront them, it is only necessary to emphasize the opposing truths.

This is a serious topic and requires serious attention. Much depends on a rational and scriptural decision of the question, *What is the most effective way to oppose and eliminate error?* To assist us in this inquiry, we need to examine how the Prophets and Apostles opposed the errors of their times. The world was just as full of error back then as it has ever been since. The idolatries of the Pagan world and the various doctrines of the philosophical sects, both in and out of the land of Israel, presented as much work for them as the various heresies of apostate Christendom do for us today. Their general approach was to direct the artillery of light and to focus the rays of day on the dark shadows of any particular error. Their philosophy was: The brilliance of light most clearly reveals the darkness and drives it away. Thus, they opposed idolatry, superstition, and error of every kind. Armed with the armor of light, like the sun in the morning, the shadows of night retreated from their presence, and the bright beams of day so delighted the eyes of their converts that they no longer loved darkness. Let us go and do likewise.

A deep familiarity with the Holy Scriptures is the best tool for the work of regenerating people. The best insight I have found in Augustine's famous treatise on preaching is the following: —

"He who handles and teaches the word of God should be a defender of the true faith and a conqueror of error; and in achieving this goal of preaching, he should win over the opposers, motivate the indifferent, and guide the ignorant in their duties and future prospects. When, however, he finds his audience receptive, attentive, and willing to learn, or succeeds in making them so, then other actions should be taken as needed. If they need instruction, then to familiarize them with the topic at hand, storytelling must be used; and to clarify what is uncertain, reasoning and evidence must be employed. If they need to be moved rather than instructed, then to awaken them from apathy and encourage them to fully embrace what they acknowledge as true, the higher powers of eloquence will be necessary; it will be essential to persuade, correct, inspire, restrain, and do whatever else may effectively move the heart.

"All this is indeed what most people constantly do regarding the tasks they undertake through speaking. Some, however, are blunt, cold, and unrefined in their approach; others are clever, elegant, and passionate. Now, anyone engaged in the work I am discussing must be able to speak and debate with wisdom, even if they cannot do so with eloquence, in order to benefit their audience; although they will be less effective in this case than if they could combine wisdom and eloquence. A person who is eloquent without wisdom is certainly to be avoided, as the listener may be charmed by what is ultimately useless and may believe what is said to be true simply because it is expressed beautifully. This sentiment was noted by the ancients, who recognized the importance of teaching the art of rhetoric; they acknowledged that wisdom without eloquence benefits states very little, while eloquence without wisdom benefits them not at all and often proves highly damaging. If, therefore, those who taught the principles of eloquence, even if ignorant of true, that is, heavenly wisdom 'which comes down from the Father of lights,' were compelled by the truth to make such a confession, and that too in the very texts where their principles were outlined; are we not under far greater obligation to acknowledge the same, being the sons and daughters of this heavenly wisdom? A person speaks with greater or lesser wisdom according to their understanding of the sacred Scriptures. I do not mean merely reading them and memorizing them, but in rightly understanding them and diligently exploring their meaning. There are those who read them yet neglect them—who read to remember the words but fail to grasp their meaning. To these, without a doubt, those who retain fewer words of the Scriptures but seek their genuine significance with their innermost feelings are to be preferred. But better than both is the one who can recite them at will while also understanding them as they ought to be understood."

Luther's favorite saying was, "*Bonus Textuarius, Bonus Theologus;*" or, One who is well acquainted with the Scriptures makes a good theologian.

There is one thing, above all else, that must never be overlooked by anyone dedicated to the work of regeneration. This crucial consideration is that the ultimate goal of all their efforts is *to impress the moral image of God upon the moral nature of humanity.* To draw this image on the heart, to transform the mind of humanity into the likeness of God in all moral feelings, is the aim proposed in the remedial system. The mold into which the mind of humanity is to be shaped is the Apostles' doctrine; or the seal by which this impression is to be made is the testimony of God. The gospel facts are like various types that, when skillfully arranged by a skilled compositor, create a complete form, upon which, when the mind of humanity is placed by the power that God has given to the preacher, every type makes its full impression on the heart. The will, or law, of the character of our Father who is in heaven is written on the understanding and engraved on the heart.

The Apostles were these skilled compositors who provided us with a *perfect 'form of sound words.'* Our role consists of bringing the minds of people to this form or impressing it on their hearts. To do this most effectively, the preacher or evangelist must have the word of Christ dwelling in them richly, in all wisdom; and they must 'study to show themselves approved workmen, unashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.' The one who is most eloquent and wise in the Holy Scriptures, who has them most readily available, will have the most influence with people; because being equipped with the words of the Holy Spirit, they possess the very arguments that the Spirit of God chooses to use in reviving the dead and converting sinners. For the effectiveness of the living word, not only Paul attests, but James and Peter also provide ample testimony. 'Of his own will he has given us new birth, *by the word of truth,* that we might be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.' 'Having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, *through the word* of the living God, which endures.' To the fruits of his labors, such a preacher can say with Paul, 'To Jesus Christ, through the gospel, I have regenerated, or begotten you.'

Thus, amidst numerous interruptions, we have attempted to present to our readers the entire doctrine of Regeneration, in all its depth and breadth, in the hope that, after a more detailed consideration of its meaning and value, and by God's blessing, they may devote themselves more successfully to this great work; and not only enjoy more of the Holy Spirit themselves but also be more useful in promoting the moral regeneration of the world.

To God our Father, through the great Author of the Christian faith, who has kept us in health during this time of affliction and great distress, be everlasting thanks for renewing our minds by the Holy Spirit, and for the hope of the regeneration of our bodies, of the heavens, and of the earth, at the appearance of the Almighty Regenerator, who comes to make all things new! Amen.

12 It may again be necessary in this discerning age to clarify that in this essay, to disabuse the public mind regarding our use and understanding of the term *regeneration,* we have taken the broadest approach that a supreme regard for the apostolic style could, in our judgment, allow. While we argue that the phrase *bath of regeneration,* (Titus 3:5.) is equivalent to *immersion,* as already explained, and is distinguished from the *renewing of the Holy Spirit,* of which the immersed believer is a proper subject; we have discussed the entire process of renewal, not in the strict application of the phrase, Titus 3:5, but rather in the full scope of the figure employed by the Apostle. It is not the first act of begetting, nor the last act of being born, but the entire process of conversion alluded to in the figure of *generation,* to which we have directed the attention of our readers. For, as often stated before, our opponents deceive themselves and their listeners by representing us as attributing to the word *immersion,* and the act of immersion, all that they call *regeneration.* While, therefore, we contend that being 'born again,' and being immersed, are, in the Apostle's style, two names for the same action, we are far from suggesting or teaching that in forming the new person, there is nothing necessary but to be born.
If anyone asks why this topic wasn't fully developed in our initial essays on this subject, our answer is that we couldn't have anticipated that our opponents would misrepresent our views in such a way. If a general were asked why he didn't arrange all his troops at the beginning of the battle, as he had them arranged when he triumphed over his enemy, he would reply that the maneuvers and attacks of the enemy directed the arrangement of his forces.

Our opponents argue for a regeneration that begins and is completed before faith or baptism—a spiritual change of mind by the Holy Spirit that occurs before any knowledge, faith, or repentance, which infants are just as capable of experiencing as adults; and, therefore, as we argue, this renders the gospel ineffective. In retaliation, they would have their converts believe that we advocate only for water, sarcastically labeling us as proponents of "water regeneration." They believe there is something more sublime and divine in "spirit regeneration," and thus claim the title of orthodox. This slander has been one reason for this essay, and it has prompted that part of it which gives the fullest scope to the term *regeneration,* as the analogy allows for the figure used by the Apostle. However, when we speak in the precise language of the living scriptures on this subject, we must represent *being born again* (John 3:5) and *regeneration* (Titus 3:5) as relating solely to the act of immersion. See *Extra Defended,* pp. 24-36.

August 1st — I have just opened the Cincinnati *Baptist Journal* from July 26, from which I read an accepted definition of regeneration. It is orthodox,

spiritual, physical, mystical, and metaphysical regeneration. It is quoted from the "STANDARD." Regeneration, in the *Evangelical Standard,* is defined as follows:

- Is the sinner active in regeneration? Certainly he is. His mind is a thinking rational principle that never stops acting; therefore, when the word *passive* is applied to it by Old Divines or Calvinists, they do not mean that it is *literally* dead, like inert matter that requires a physical impulse to set it in motion. They only mean to convey the scriptural idea that the Holy Spirit is the *sole* agent in regeneration, and that the sinner has no more *efficient agency* in accomplishing it than Lazarus had in coming back to life from the dead. Still, they acknowledge that his mind is very active, but unfortunately, its activity is all *against* the Divine influence; as the Scriptures assure us, unregenerated people 'do always resist' the strivings of the Spirit. 'Every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is *only* evil continually.' 'There is none that does good, no, *not one.*' The sinner, therefore, instead of voluntarily cooperating with the Holy Spirit, does everything he can to *resist* His divine influence and *prevent* his own regeneration until he is *made* willing by almighty power.

What a comforting theory this is regarding regeneration! The sinners to be regenerated are actively striving against the Divine influence. At the moment of regeneration, "he has," in one sense, "no more efficient agency in accomplishing it than Lazarus had in coming back to life from the dead;" and in another sense, he is not passive, but "does all he can to *resist* the Divine influence and *prevent* his own regeneration until he is *made* willing by almighty power." This is *standard* theology; and anyone who preaches this theology is a pious, regenerated, Regular Orthodox Baptist Christian Minister! How valuable is all the preaching in Christendom according to this theory? The Holy Spirit may be actively working on some drunken person or some vile debauchee, who is as dead as Lazarus on one side, and on the other, resisting the Spirit with all his moral and physical energy, up to the moment that the Almighty arm pierces him to the heart with a sword and makes him alive by killing him!!!

The absurdity and recklessness of such a view of the great work of renewal seemed so glaring to us that we thought no editor in the West would have the audacity to publish it. This proves the necessity of our current essay and will explain to the discerning reader why we have given the entire process of renewal the name of regeneration, which properly belongs to the final act.

# 6. The Regeneration of the Church

The word *regeneration* has been used to describe a new state of affairs or the introduction of a new state of affairs. In this context, we want to draw our readers' attention to the necessity of the regeneration of the church.

I am not referring to the regeneration of any sectarian establishment. They are built on a different foundation — on the foundation of decrees from councils, creeds, formularies, or acts of Parliament. Instead, we speak of those groups that explicitly build on the foundation of Apostles and Prophets, without any human bond of union or rule of life — our fellow believers in the ongoing process of reformation or regeneration.

If anyone thinks that the state of affairs we have reached is the sole or ultimate goal of our aspirations or efforts, they would do us a great disservice. Indeed, there are societies among us that are far ahead of others in their progress toward the ancient order of things; however, we know of none that has fully reached that model. It is, nonetheless, encouraging to see so many societies formed and forming under the banners of reformation, determined to move forward in accordance with the sacred scriptures until they stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

Our opponents cannot or will not understand how any society can be progressing toward a better order of things than the one under which they began their journey. Their sectarian policies were quickly established, and the limits of their reformation were soon defined; beyond those limits, it quickly became heretical to move. The founders of all new divisions not only saw through a glass darkly, but their perspective was so limited by human traditions that they only aimed to move a few steps away from the hive in which they were created. A new creed was soon adopted, and then their stature was complete. They jumped from infancy to adulthood in just a few days and decided that anyone who dared to advance further should be treated as those who refused to leave the old hive. Thus, it became as blameworthy to grow beyond a certain standard as it was not to grow at all. This has never been our proposition, and it can never be our goal. We have no new creed to form, no rules of discipline to adopt. We have taken the Living Oracles as our creed, our rules, and measures of faith and practice; and in this area, we have no additions, alterations, or amendments to propose. However, in striving to meet this standard of knowledge, faith, and behavior, we have something ahead of us that we have not yet attained.

To be clearly understood on this subject, we will specifically address the things lacking in our individual characters and the things lacking in our church order, to give our meetings the interest and influence they should have on the brotherhood and on society at large.

It should be understood that our remarks on the things lacking in the disciples apply not to every individual, but to the general group. First of all, there is a need for a more general and specific knowledge of the Holy Scriptures than is possessed by a large majority of the reformers. There may also be a lack of desire or inclination for that private devotional reading of the oracles of God, which is essential for growth in the knowledge of God and Jesus Christ, the most striking attributes of Christian character. We reason from the proficiency observable within our circle, which is large enough to provide data for every general conclusion.

Reading the Scriptures to carry out into practice all that we learn, and reading them simply to know what is written, are very different objectives and will yield very different results. Their influence on our temperament and behavior, in the former case, will soon become evident to all with whom we associate; while, in the latter case, there is no visible improvement. David said that he 'hid the word of God in his heart,' or stored it in his mind, 'that he might not sin against God;' and that he had 'more understanding than all his teachers, because God's testimonies were his meditation.' It will be accepted that the sacred writings of the Apostles and Evangelists of Jesus Christ should be as precious and delightful to Christians as the ancient oracles were to the most devout Jews. As an example of what we mean by private devotional reading and study of the oracles of Christ, we will allow a Jew to share his experience: —

'The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver. With my whole heart I have sought you; my soul breaks with longing for your judgments at all times. Your testimonies are my delight and my counselors. Teach me, O Lord, the way of your statutes, and I will keep it to the end. Give me understanding, and I will keep your law; yes, I will observe it with my whole heart. Make me walk in the path of your commandments, for in it I delight. Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you because of your righteous judgments. Oh, how I love your law; it is my meditation all day! How sweet are your words to my taste; sweeter than honey to my mouth! Your testimonies I have taken as a heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart. Great peace have those who love your law — nothing shall cause them to stumble.'

These are just a few excerpts from one piece, written by a king three thousand years ago. On another occasion, he praised the testimony of God: —

'The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple: the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold — yes, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb. By them is your servant warned, and in keeping them there is great reward.'

This fully reveals what we mean by a devotional private study of the Holy Scriptures. Every Christian who can read may refresh, strengthen, and comfort their heart every day by reading or memorizing, and then reflecting on, some portion of the book. They can carry the blessed volume in their pocket and take a look at it many times throughout the day. This will protect them from temptation, impart courage to their heart, give fluency to their speech, and the graces of Christianity to their life.

In this age, when ignorance of the Christian Scriptures is so prevalent, and the obsession with human opinions and traditions is so rampant, it is doubly imperative for our brethren to devote themselves much more to the study of the book; and then one of them will put a host of outsiders to flight; and, what is even more desirable, they will have communion with God all day and always rejoice in their salvation.

Secondly, there is a need among disciples, who are heads of families, for more attention and much more effort to raise their children 'in the correction and instruction of the Lord.' The children of all believers should be taught the oracles of God from the very beginning of their understanding. The good seed should be sown in their hearts before the strong seeds of vice can take root. *From a child,* Timothy knew the Holy Scriptures, and they were able to make him wise to salvation through faith in Christ. How many more Timothies might we have if we had a few more daughters of Lois and a few more mothers like Eunice! Most saints in this generation seem more eager for their children to shine on earth than in heaven — and that they may be wealthy here, at the risk of eternal bankruptcy. They work to make them rich and fashionable, rather than pure and holy; and spend more time shaping them to the foolish and wicked tastes of *polished* society than in teaching them by precept and example the word that is better than gold and more precious than rubies. They sow darnel and cannot reap wheat. They may have a sorrowful harvest, and years of bitterness and regret may reward them for their negligence and error. If only a fraction of the time, effort, and expense that goes into preparing a son or daughter to shine in the middle or upper ranks of *genteel* society were spent teaching them to fear God and keep His commandments, how many more virtuous, solid, and useful citizens — how many more valuable members of the family of God — how many more faithful and capable witnesses for the truth of God would be found in every corner of the land!

Every Christian family ought to be a nursery for God. Their children should be trained for the skies. For such are the promises of God, such are the facts on record, and such is the experience of Christians, that every parent who fulfills their duty to their children may expect to see them inherit the blessing. Their teaching efforts, supported by their example and constant prayers, will seldom or never fail to influence their descendants to walk in their ways. The very command to raise their children in the Lord implies that it is possible. Both Testaments provide us with assurance that such efforts will not be in vain. The men of high renown in sacred history were generally the sons of such parentage. The sons of God were found among the sons of Seth, while the daughters of men were of the lineage of Cain. Abraham was a descendant of Shem; Moses and Aaron were the sons of believing parents; Samuel was the son of Hannah, and David was the son of Jesse. John the Baptist was the son of Zachariah and Elizabeth; and it pleased the heavenly Father that His Son should be the child of a devout virgin.
But it is under Christ that the faithful are provided with all the necessary means to raise their children for the Lord. The many failures we observe can be traced either to significant neglect or to some harmful belief that paralyzes all effort; for some think that the salvation or damnation of their children is a matter settled for all eternity, regardless of any action on their part: that some are born 'vessels of wrath,' and others 'vessels of mercy;' and thus the instructions, examples, and prayers of parents are of no use. Among the descendants of such, it will often happen that some *become* vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, while others *become* vessels of mercy, predestined for glory.

When God revealed Himself to Jacob and commanded a law to Israel, He instructed them to 'teach it to their children, so that they might *put their trust in God,* and not be, like their fathers, a rebellious generation.' The Apostles of Christ have also taught Christians the same lesson. This is our guide, not our own reasoning. Now let the disciples make this their priority, morning, noon, and evening, and then we will see its effects.

We are saddened to see this great duty, to which nature, reason, and revelation all point, so neglected by many of our fellow believers — to find among their children those who are no better acquainted with the Scriptures than the children of their neighbors, who believe in miraculous conversions, or think it is a sin to attempt what they believe to be the work of God alone — never suspecting that God works through human means and employs human agency in His works of providence and redemption.

I have only known a very few families that made it their daily practice to raise their children in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, to have them memorize a portion of the living oracles every day; but these few examples lead me to believe, and to say, that such a course, if continued and supported by the good example of parents, will generally, if not universally, result in the salvation of their children. And before anyone claims to have found an exception to the proverbs of Solomon, which says, 'Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it,' — let them show that this child was '*trained up in the way he should go.*'

In the third place, there is a lack among the disciples of a stricter regard for relational duties — we mean, not only the duties that justice, truth, and moderation demand; but *all* relational duties. As long as Christians live like people of the world, according to the customs of this age, they must, like others, incur debts they cannot promptly pay, make agreements and bargains, give promises they cannot fulfill, and stake pledges they are unable to redeem. All this is completely incompatible with our profession. Such were not the early disciples. Skeptics of every kind, people of the world, who have ever read the New Testament, know that such behavior is utterly incompatible with the letter and spirit of Christianity. A Christian's word or promise should be, and is, if Christ is honored, as solemn and binding as any contract. And as for breaking a bargain or covenant, even when it is greatly or entirely to the disadvantage of the Christians, it is not even to be considered — 'he changes not, though to his hurt he covenants.' How much has the gospel lost of its influence because of the unfaithfulness of its followers! O! when will it again be said of Christians in general, that 'they bind themselves, as with a solemn oath, not to commit any kind of wickedness — to be guilty neither of theft, robbery, nor adultery — *never to break a promise,* or to withhold a deposit when called upon.' Pliny wrote to Emperor Trajan that such was the character of Christians A.D. 106-7, as far as he could learn from those who were not Christians. If all the common (nowadays rather *uncommon*) virtues of justice, truth, fidelity, and honesty were practiced by all Christians, how many mouths would be silenced, and how many new arguments in favor of Jesus Christ could all parties find! But even if these common virtues were as widespread as the Christian profession, there are other finer virtues of benevolence, goodness, mercy, and sympathy, which belong to the profession, expressed in caring for the sick, the orphan, and the widow — in alleviating all the afflictions of our fellow human beings. Add these virtues, or *graces,* as we sometimes call them, to the others, and then how compelling the argument for the divine authenticity of the gospel! Let industry, frugality, temperance, honesty, justice, truth, fidelity, humility, mercy, and sympathy shine brightly in the lives of the disciples, and the contrast between them and other professing believers will advocate for their cause more successfully than a hundred preachers.

Lastly, there is a need for a more elevated piety to bring the Christian character up to the standard of early times. We do not need fine speeches or eloquent orations on the excellencies of Christian piety and devotion. These are generally acknowledged. But we need to be awakened from our complacency, from our worldly-mindedness, from our sinful conformity to a fallen generation, to display that holiness in speech and behavior, without which no one will see the Lord. What do the numerous exhortations of the Apostles to watchfulness and prayer mean, if these are not essential to our devotion to God and dedication to His service?

If our affections are not set on things above, we are unfit for the kingdom of glory. To see the folly of a profession of Christianity without the power of godliness, we need only ask, How is that person fit for the enjoyment of God and Christ, whose heart is filled with the cares, anxieties, and concerns of this life — whose whole life is a life of labor and care for the body — a life devoted to the objects of time and sense? No one can serve God and Mammon. Where the treasure is, the heart must also be. There, the affections turn their course. There is no room for the Spirit of God in a mind devoted to the affairs of this life. The spirit of the policies of this world and the Spirit of God cannot dwell in the same heart. If Jesus or His Apostles taught any doctrine clearly, fully, and unequivocally, it is this doctrine, that 'the cares of this world, the desires for other things, and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, making it unfruitful.'

If anyone wants to enjoy the power of godliness, they must give their whole soul to it. The business of this life will be performed religiously, as a duty subordinate to the will of God. While their hands are engaged in that business which their own needs, or those of their household, make necessary, their affections are above. They delight in God and commune with Him all day. A Christian is not someone who is pious only occasionally, who is religious or devout one day of the week, or for one hour of the day. It is the whole direction of their soul — it is the beginning, middle, and end of every day. To make their calling and election sure is the business of their life. Their mind rests only in God. They keep the Lord always before them. This is their joy and delight. They would not for the world have it any other way. They would not enjoy eternal life if they had the option, in any other way than that which God Himself has proposed. They agree to God's arrangements, not out of necessity, but by choice. Their religious services are perfect freedom. They are free indeed. The Lord's commandments are not burdensome, but joyful. The yoke of Christ is easy for them, and His burden is light. They will sing, with David —

```
The love that to thy laws I bear,
No language can display;
They with fresh wonders entertain
My ravish'd thoughts all day.

The law that from thy mouth proceeds,
Of more esteem I hold,
Than untouch'd stores, than thousand mines
Of silver and of gold.

Whilst in the way of thy commands,
More solid joy I found,
Than had I been with vast increase
Of envied riches crown'd.

Thy testimonies I have kept,
And constantly obey'd;
Because the love I bore to them
Thy service easy made.
```

In the same measure that Christians devoutly study the oracles of God, teach them to their children, practice all relational duties to society at large, and rise to a more elevated piety, they will increase their influence in the great and heavenly work of regenerating the world.

A few remarks on the things lacking in the order of Christian assemblies, to give their public meetings that influence on themselves and on society at large, will conclude this section of our essay.

Our heavenly Father desires our happiness in all His institutions. His ordinances are, therefore, the surest, simplest, and most direct means of promoting our happiness. The Lord Jesus gave Himself for the church so that He might purify and bless it; and, therefore, in the church are all the institutions that can promote the individual and social good of the Christian community. In attending these institutions on the Lord's day, much depends on the preparation of heart in all who come together to commemorate the death and resurrection of the Son of God.

In considering the most scriptural and rational way of celebrating or observing the day of the Lord, both for their own comfort and the regeneration of the world, we would first remark that much depends on the state of mind, or preparation of heart, in which we visit the assemblies of the saints.

Suppose two people, A and B, if you will, members of the same church, take their seats together at the Lord's table. A, from the moment he opens his eyes in the morning, is filled with thoughts of the Savior's life, death, and resurrection. In his private time, with his family, and along the way, he meditates or talks about the wonders of redemption, and recalls the sayings and actions of the Messiah. B, on the other hand, wakes up like any other day, and finding himself free from all obligations arising from the holiness of the time, talks about the everyday affairs and allows his thoughts to wander over the business of the past week, or perhaps to plan for the next week. If he meets a neighbor, friend, or brother, the news of the day is discussed; the crops, the markets, the public health, or the weather — the affairs of Europe, or the actions of Congress, or the prospects of some candidate for political office — become the topic of conversation. As he rides or walks to church, he chats about all or any of these subjects until he enters the door of the meeting house. Now, as A and B enter the house in very different states of mind, can we not suppose that they will differ as much in their enjoyment as in their morning thoughts? Or can B, with a single effort, clear his mind, rein in his wandering thoughts, and in a moment transport himself from contemplating earthly things to heavenly things? If this can be imagined, then meditation and preparation of heart are entirely unnecessary for the acceptable worship of God and the comfortable enjoyment of His institutions.
But is it consistent with experience, or does it make sense, that B can take joy in God and celebrate the wonders of redemption while his thoughts are scattered among a thousand distractions? — while, like a fool's eyes, his thoughts wander to the ends of the earth? Can he say, with a devout Jew, "How lovely are your dwelling places, O Lord of hosts! My soul longs — yes, even faints, for the courts of the Lord! My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they will be continually praising you! A day in your courts is better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness." — "One thing I have desired of the Lord, and that I will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. O send out your light and your truth! Let them lead me, let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling places. Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy; yes, I will praise you, O God, my God!"

Or did the Jew have a more sublime worship, more exalted views of God's salvation, and more piety than a Christian? Or were the practices of the Jewish sanctuary more engaging and refreshing than those of the Christian church? This will not be claimed; therefore, B and all of that mindset are completely mistaken when they approach the house of God with the same mindset as they would approach the marketplace, the forum, or the common places of this world.

Christians need not excuse themselves by saying that all days are alike, that all places and times are equally holy, and that they should always be in the best frame of mind. Even if we concede all their points, they will not argue that a person should speak to God or come into the presence of God as they would approach other people. They will not say that they should have the same thoughts or feelings when approaching the Lord's table as they do when approaching a common table; or when entering a courtroom of justice, as when coming into the house of God. There is, in the words of Solomon the Wise, a time and season for every purpose and every work: There is the Lord's day, the Lord's table, the Lord's house, and the Lord's people; and there are thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors that are compatible and incompatible with all these. In the public assembly, the entire order of worship should reflect what is happening in the minds of all the worshippers. That joy in the Lord, that peace and serenity of mind, that affection for one another, that reverence for the institutions of God's house, which all feel, should be evident in all the activities of the day. Nothing that would undermine any of these should ever appear in the congregation of Jesus Christ our Lord. No levity, irreverence, gloom, sadness, pride, unkindness, harshness toward anyone, coldness — nothing but love, peace, joy, humility, and reverence should be evident in the face, words, or actions of any disciple.

These are not trivial matters. They all have a positive influence on both the brethren and the strangers. These are visible and tangible displays of the character and spirit of Christians; and if Paul thought it necessary to write about *veils* and *long hair* when advising a church "to do all things decently and in order," we, in this time of decline, may be allowed to address matters as minute as those before us.

We do not intend to delve into details of church order or Christian discipline, nor to elaborate on the necessity of dedicating time to singing, praying, reading, teaching, exhorting, commemorating, and communicating; nor on how much of this or that is appropriate. Times and circumstances must determine how much time should be spent on these activities, and when it is most fitting to meet, to adjourn, etc. Nor is it necessary to state that there must be scriptural order, leadership, proper discipline, and mutual respect in the fear of God. We are now speaking more about the *manner* in which all things should be done, and the things themselves, their necessity or value.

After noting what seems to be lacking in the manner of gathering on the Lord's day, we will proceed to identify the things that are lacking in many congregations for the purposes already mentioned.

First of all, it should be noted that in some churches there seems to be a lack of *a proper method of handling the Scriptures for the edification of the brethren.* It is acknowledged by all the holy brethren that the Scriptures of truth, referred to as *the living oracles,* are the primary instrument of God for all his purposes among the saints on earth. Through them, they are converted to God, comforted, consecrated, made fit for an inheritance among the sanctified, and equipped for every good word and work. Everything, then, depends on the proper understanding of these inspired texts. They can only have an effect as far as they are understood.

The practice of preaching on a text is now almost universally abandoned by those who intend for their listeners to grasp the testimony of God. Speakers and exhorters may choose a word, a phrase, or a verse; but all who nourish the flock of God with knowledge and understanding know that this method is entirely ineffective. Philological lectures on a chapter are only slightly better. Discussing a specific topic, such as faith, repentance, election, or the Christian calling, may sometimes be beneficial: but in a congregation of Christians, reading and examining different books in a regular sequence, with each disciple having the text in hand, following the connections, examining parallel passages, questioning and being questioned, clarifying the meaning of specific words and phrases by comparing them with the style of that writer or speaker, or with others; interspersing these exercises with prayer and praise, and keeping the narrative, the epistle, or the speech before the minds of all long enough for even the youngest disciple in the congregation to understand and become deeply engaged with it, will accomplish more in one year than is achieved in many popular meetings today.

Great attention should be given to allusions in any composition to the specifics of time, place, and circumstance, as well as the geographical, historical, and chronological details of all factual questions related to notable individuals in the narratives: for these often serve as the best interpreters of style and expositors of the meaning of what is written.

This searching, examining, comparing, and reflecting on the Holy Scriptures in private, in the family, and in the congregation cannot fail to make us knowledgeable about God and humanity. The Bible contains more real learning than all the writings of men. It instructs us in all our natural, moral, political, and religious relationships. Though it does not teach us astronomy, medicine, chemistry, or mathematics, it provides all the knowledge that enriches and dignifies our moral nature and prepares us for happiness. Blessed is the person who meditates on it day and night! He grows and thrives in moral health and vigor, like trees planted by streams of water. His leaf never withers — his fruit never fails.

The congregations of the saints lack a system for advancing the knowledge of this book. Simply reading large portions in a random manner has some positive effect; for there is light, majesty, and life in all the oracles of God; no one can listen to them without being edified. However, the benefit gained from such readings is not a fraction of what could be achieved through proper systematic reading and examination. The congregation is the school of Christ, and every student there should feel that he has learned something every day he spends with his Master. He must take the Master's book with him, and, like every other good and orderly student, he must open it and study it, with all the resources that the brotherhood, his classmates, can provide for his deeper understanding of all its beneficial teachings.

A Christian scribe, well-versed in its contents, or a group of such individuals who can draw from their intellectual treasury things both new and old, will greatly enhance the students' understanding of this heavenly knowledge; but, in the absence of such, the students must be self-taught; and self-taught scholars are generally the best educated: for they cannot progress unless they study diligently and carefully learn the basics of every discipline.

To illustrate the diligence and attention to the smallest details necessary for proficiency in understanding all that is written in the New Testament, let us suppose that the disciples have for their lesson, on a particular day, the Nativity of the Messiah. The second chapter of Matthew is read. After reading this chapter, or the entire first section of Matthew's testimony, the elder or president for the day asks a brother, a good reader, to read what the other evangelists have testified on this subject. Since Mark and John are silent on the nativity, he reads Luke chapter 2, from verses 1 to 41. After the reading of this chapter, the following points are the subject of inquiry, and most of them are proposed to the brethren for discussion: —

1. Who was Caesar Augustus, and over what people did he reign?  
2. At what point in his reign was the edict of enrollment issued, or when did the first register take effect?  
3. What did Syria include, and what were its boundaries?  
4. Who presided over Syria at the time of the first register?  
5. Who was king in Judea at this time?
6. How far did Judea extend, or in what part of the Holy Land was it located?  
7. In what country was Jerusalem located, and by what other names was it known?  
8. What was the hometown of Joseph?  
9. Where was Nazareth located, and in what region?  
10. What were the boundaries of Galilee, and what were its main towns?  
11. In what area was Bethlehem, and how far was it from Jerusalem?  
12. Who were the magi?  
13. Why was 'Herod alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him,' when the magi reported the Star in the East?  
14. Who were the scribes and chief priests assembled by Herod, and why were they called together?  
15. How did they decide the questions referred to them?  
16. Which Prophet do they rely on, and where can the quotation be found?  
17. What family and lineage did Joseph and Mary belong to?  
18. How did the magi find the house where the Messiah was born?  
19. Why did the magi not return to Herod?  
20. Who came first to pay their respects to the Messiah, the shepherds of Bethlehem or the eastern magi?  
21. In what part of the world is Egypt located?  
22. How far is it from Bethlehem?  
23. How long was the Messiah in Egypt?  
24. Who predicted his return from Egypt, and where can it be found?  
25. Who foretold the slaughter of the male infants in Bethlehem, and what prompted Herod to this cruel massacre?  
26. Who succeeded Herod on the throne of Judea?  
27. Why did Joseph move to Nazareth?  
28. Which Prophet foretold this event, and where can it be found?

Having established these matters, which the maps, geographical and chronological indexes, and the appendix to the Family Testament will greatly assist with, some moral reflections will naturally arise; for in all these incidents are evident the wisdom, care, and providence of our heavenly Father, his faithfulness, humility, and love; the great variety of his instruments and agents; the ease with which he frustrates the evil plans and schemes of his enemies; the infallible certainty of his foreknowledge; the perfect free will of men, both good and evil; the deep humiliation of his only-begotten Son in all the circumstances of his birth. Irresistible arguments in favor of his claims can be drawn from these ancient prophecies, from their specific details of time, place, and circumstance; many eloquent and powerful lessons on human pride, vanity, and arrogance can be derived from the birthplace, cradle, and family connections of the Heir of the Universe; and many other touching appeals to the heart, which the birth, circumcision, and dedication of the Messiah, along with all the events in Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and the Temple related to his first appearance on earth, will present themselves, with enduring freshness and beauty, to the community of Christ.

A hint to the wise is sufficient. If this method were pursued for just two hours every Sunday, with every disciple dedicating their heart to the work; and if the results were then compared with the outcomes of the scrap Doctors or sermonizers to sleeping and dreaming listeners, no one with any regard for their reputation for common sense could support the popular system.

A reformation in the way we handle the living oracles is greatly needed; and the sooner and more widely it is attempted, the greater will be the renewing influence of the community on the world. Knowledgeable in the Holy Scriptures, equipped with the armor of light, every disciple going forth will be like David against the Philistines — a host against the armies of the outsiders. And even better, with the words of heavenly favor dwelling in his heart, he will carry with him into every society a fragrance like the rose of Sharon — a sweetness of perfume like a garden blessed by the Lord.

It seems that some congregations lack proper attention to discipline and a due regard for decorum in managing such cases as arise. In every family and in every congregation, there is occasional need for discipline. Offenses, wrongdoings, and apostasies did occur in the congregations overseen by the apostles; and they will happen again in this state of discipline and trial in which we all find ourselves. They must be expected; and every congregation should be prepared to respond to emergencies with intelligence and decorum. Much harm has been done to the progress of churches by neglecting such cases and in the way they have been handled when addressed.

Nothing can be more absurd and offensive to every sense of good order and decorum than that every offender and offense should, at the very outset, be brought into the public assembly. Those who care for a congregation, the elders whose age and experience have taught them prudence, should be informed of such cases first; and they should present the matter to the congregation. Every novice should not feel free to disturb the congregation by presenting, on their own authority and at their own discretion, a complaint against a brother, whether it be of a public or private nature.

But we are now discussing the *manner* of proceeding in such cases. The most tender regard for the feelings of all, the utmost sympathy for the offender, the most unwavering firmness in applying the corrections that the Head of the church has commanded, and the necessity of acting promptly in accordance with the law in the case, are all very important matters.

No passion, no favoritism, no bad feelings — only love and piety, faithfulness and truth; only courtesy and gentleness, should ever be present in the house of God. And when anyone is found guilty and excluded from the community, it should be done with all solemnity, and with prayer that the institution of Christ may be a blessing to the transgressor.

However, wrongdoers, or those who do not act honorably according to the law of Christ, should not be tolerated in the professed family of God. Such individuals are a burden on the entire community — blemishes in every feast of love, and stains on the whole profession. One sinner destroys much good; yet separation or removal, like amputation, should only be used as a last resort, when all other remedies, such as admonition and entreaty, have failed. To prevent gangrene, or harm to the whole body, amputation becomes necessary, an indispensable remedy. More strictness, more firmness, and more tenderness in such cases would greatly enhance the moral influence of every community. A few individuals walking together in the bonds of Christian love, and under the discipline of Christ, is better than the largest assembly in which there are visibly and manifestly many who do not fear God and do not keep his commandments.

In the house of God, there should be purity, reverence, meekness, brotherly kindness, and love. Confidence in the honesty and sincerity of our brethren is the lifeblood of communion. To feel united with those who are committed to eternal life, and resolved to seek first of all, above all, the kingdom of heaven and the righteousness required in it, is most uplifting, comforting, and invigorating. But to be uncertain whether we are joining a mass of ignorance, corruption, and apathy is a decay in the bones; love grows cold, and then we have the form, without the power of godliness.

For the church to have a renewing influence on society at large, there needs to be a fuller display of Christian compassion in all her public meetings; care for the poor, shown through the generosity of her contributions; the expression of genuine sympathy for the suffering of humanity, not only among the community but among all people; and a passionate zeal for the conversion of sinners proportional to her professed appreciation of the value of her own salvation, and to her resources and means of enlightening the world about the unseen and eternal. The full display of these attributes is the most effective means of spreading the gospel and achieving new victories among our fellow citizens. The spiritual health and vitality of every church should be measured more by her efforts and success in bringing sinners back to God than by all her other accomplishments. For too long, it has been seen as the duty, almost the exclusive duty, of the preacher to convert the world. He must spend his time and wear out his body in traveling and preaching, while the individual members of the church are expected to mind their own business, seek their own wealth and domestic comfort. He must endure the heat and the cold, leave his wife and family, and entrust the management of his affairs to others, while they only need to watch and pray for his success. What a strange delusion! Has he received a commission from above — has he been drafted out of the ranks to go to war, while they all stay home to take care of their wives and children? Some may believe this — some may think it is his duty alone to spend his time and talents in this work, while theirs is to labor for their own interests; but surely such are not the views and feelings of our brethren!

The work of the Lord will never progress — in other words, the renewing influence of the church will amount to little or nothing, as long as it is thought to be not equally the duty of every member, or the special duty of one or two, called preachers, to labor for the Lord.

There is either a special call, a general call, or no call at all, to labor for the conversion of the world. If there are a few specially called, the rest have nothing to do but to mind their own concerns; 'to seek their own things, and not the things of Jesus Christ.' If none are called, then it is the duty of none, and the Lord has nothing for his people to do — no world to convert; or at least, nothing for them to do in that work. None of us are prepared for the consequences of either of these assumptions. It follows, then, that it is the duty of all to labor according to their respective abilities in this work. All are called to labor for the Lord. I believe that every citizen in Christ's kingdom is bound to take up arms for the King, just as much as I am; and if he cannot go to fight the battles of the Lord, he must take care of the wives and children of those who can and will fight for their King and country. But the cost of the war must be borne by the subjects of the crown; and since the Lord will not have any tax collectors in his kingdom, but accepts only voluntary contributions, he keeps a record of those who do nothing, and he will settle with them upon his return. He even calls the contributions for the gospel, made by those at home, 'a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.'
But we are hesitant to take any action like this, fearing we might resemble others who we believe have acted unwisely. It's strange that once something has been misused, it seems it can never be used again! However, I have unintentionally wandered off from my main point. The way the members work for the salvation of the world is all that falls within our defined limits. Enough has been said about this. Let the members seriously consider what is needed to give their meetings the influence they should have on themselves and on society as a whole.

We can gain moral and spiritual benefits from our own good order and decorum in the congregation, just as those who attend our meetings as spectators can. In this case, as in all the ways we do good, those who help others are also helped in return; for those who bless others are always blessed in the act of blessing them. No one enjoys the blessings of the gospel more fully than those who are most active and influential in blessing others. What joyful times are those when we see many turning to the Lord! If we want to have a continuous celebration, we must be continuously devoted to promoting the happiness of others. We must live for God, as well as live to God.

As we fill in these outlines, other matters that are more detailed, but perhaps equally important, will come to the attention of the members. We cannot start on these matters too soon. The time has come again when judgment must begin at the house of God. The people who have long enjoyed the word of life and Christian institutions must soon face a reckoning. They must give an account of their stewardship, for the Lord has promised to call them to judgment. An era is just around the corner, which will be known as *the Regeneration* for a thousand years to come. The Lord Jesus will judge that unfaithful generation and hand them over to the burning flame, who have broken the covenant and formed alliances with the governments of the earth. Now the cry is heard in our land, "Come out of her, my people, so that you do not partake in her sins, and so that you may not receive her plagues." The Lord Jesus will soon rebuild Jerusalem and restore the tabernacle of David, which has long been in ruins. Let the church prepare herself for the return of her Lord and ensure that she is ready for his appearance.

# 3. The New Life

'*Newness of life*' is a Hebraism for a *new life*. The new birth brings us into a new state. 'Old things have passed away; all things have become new,' says an Apostle: 'for if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.' A new spirit, a new heart, and an outward character that reflects this change are the results of the regenerating process: 'for the end of the change,' the grand results of the remedial system, is 'love from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith.' 'Love is the fulfillment of the whole law,' and the fruit of the whole gospel. It is the central principle of all Christian behavior, the essence of the new person, the breath of the new life. Faith operates by no other rule. It is a working principle, and love is the standard by which it functions. The Spirit of God is the spirit of love and the foundation of a sound mind. Every beat of the new heart is the impulse of the spirit of love. Hence, the brotherhood is cherished, and all humanity is embraced in boundless goodwill. When the tongue speaks, and the hands and feet move and act under the unrestrained guidance of this principle, we see the Christian character brought to life. For meekness, humility, mercy, sympathy, and active benevolence are simply the names of the various expressions of this all-renovating, invigorating, sanctifying, and joy-giving principle. 'He who dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him.'

The Christian, or the new person, is then a philanthropist to the fullest extent of that word. Truth and love have freed him from all the tyrannies of passion, from guilt, fear, and shame; they have filled him with courage, both active and passive. Therefore, his mission, his primary mission, to which all others contribute, is to join our Savior in the salvation of the world. 'If by any means I may save some' are not just the words of Paul, but of every *new person*. Are they merchants, mechanics, farmers? — are they magistrates, lawyers, judges, or everyday citizens? — are they masters, servants, fathers, sons, brothers, neighbors? — whatever or wherever they may be, they live for God and His city, for the King and His kingdom. They do not associate with the children of wrath — the miser, the selfish, the prodigal, the carefree, the proud, the slanderer, the gossip, the rake, the libertine, the drunkard, the thief, the murderer. Every new person has left these confines; has broken his alliance with Satan and his followers, and has joined himself to the family of God. These he loves with joy — those he pities — and he does good to all.

The character of the new person is an elevated character. Recognizing himself as a son and an heir of God, he cultivates the attitude, spirit, and behavior that correspond with such an exalted relationship. He despises everything mean, lowly, earthly, sensual, and devilish. Just as the only begotten and beloved Son of God is to be the model of his future personal glory, so the character that Jesus displayed among people is the model for his daily imitation. His everyday aspiration is —  

- Thy fair example will I trace, 

To teach me what I ought to be; Make me by thy transforming grace, Lord Jesus, daily more like thee." 

The law of God is hidden in his heart. The living oracles dwell in his mind; and he grows in favor with God as he grows in the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ his Lord. As a newborn babe, he desires the pure milk of the word of God, that he may grow by it; for just as the thirsty deer longs for streams of water, so his soul longs for God. Thus he lives for God and walks with Him. This is the character of the regenerate — of one who is born of God — of the new person in Christ Jesus. This is the change of heart, life, and character that is the tendency and the fruit of the process of regeneration, as taught and exemplified by the Apostles and those commended by God in their writings.

We now proceed to offer a few remarks on physical regeneration, the second part of our subject.

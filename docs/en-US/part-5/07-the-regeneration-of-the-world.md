# 7. The Regeneration of the World

All the kingdoms of this world will soon become the kingdoms of our Lord the King. He will throw all the current rulers from their thrones. He will crush the despotic systems, both civil and religious; and with the breath of his mouth, scatter them to the four winds of heaven. The antichristian power, whether it is called Papal, Islamic, Pagan, or Atheistic, will certainly be destroyed, just as Jesus reigns in heaven. No trace of them will remain. The best government on earth, whether English or American, contains within it the seeds of its own destruction — carries in its constitution a millstone that will sink it to the bottom of the sea. They do not acknowledge that God has set his Christ upon his throne. They will not honor the Son. Society under their rule is not blessed. The land suffers because of the wickedness of those in high places. Ignorance, poverty, and crime abound due to the injustices and wrongs of those who guide the destinies of nations. Men who do not fear God, do not love his Son, and do not respect the principles of his governance, still wield the sword and hold the scepter in all lands.

This is completely contrary to the peace and happiness of the world. Therefore, he will shatter them like a potter's vessel and establish a society where justice, unwavering justice, will have complete dominion. Jesus will be universally acknowledged by all of humanity, and all nations will pay him homage. This state of society will be the fulfillment of the Christian religion, in all its moral influences and effects on humanity.

How much of this change will come about through moral means and how much through physical means is not the focus of our current inquiry. However, preparing a people for the coming of the Lord must result from restoring the ancient gospel and order of things. And whenever it happens, the day of the regeneration of the world will be as remarkable and fearsome as the day of the flood, the judgment of Sodom, or the catastrophe of Jerusalem. Who will stand when the Lord does this?

But all regenerations, whether physical or moral, individual, congregational, or national, are merely types and shadows, or means of preparation for the —

## Regeneration of the Heavens and the Earth

The Bible begins with the creation of the heavens and the earth; but the Christian revelation ends with the regenerations, or new creation of the heavens and the earth. This is the ancient promise of God, confirmed to us by the Christian Apostles. The current elements are to be changed by fire. The old or pre-flood earth was purified by water; but the present earth is reserved for fire, along with all the works of man that are upon it. It will be transformed into a lake of liquid fire. However, those who have died in Christ will have been regenerated in body before the old earth is renewed by fire. The bodies of the saints will be as compatible with the new earth and heavens as their current bodies are with the present heavens and earth. God recreates and regenerates, but annihilates nothing; therefore, the present earth is not to be destroyed. The best description we can give of this regeneration is in the words of one who had a vision of it on the island of Patmos. He describes it as far as it is connected with the New Jerusalem, which is to stand upon the new earth, under the canopy of the new heaven: —

'And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away; and the sea was no more. And I, John, saw the holy city, the New Jerusalem, descending from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell among them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be among them — their God. And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death will be no more, nor grief, nor crying; nor will there be any more pain: for the former things have passed away.'

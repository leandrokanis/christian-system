# 7. The Regeneration of the World

All the kingdoms of this world will soon become the kingdoms of our Lord the King. He will overthrow all the current rulers from their thrones. He will crush the despotisms, both civil and religious; and with the breath of his mouth, scatter them to the four winds of heaven. The antichristian powers, whether called Papal, Muslim, Pagan, or Atheistic, will be destroyed as surely as Jesus reigns in heaven. No trace of them will remain. The best governments on earth, whether English or American, contain the seeds of their own destruction—they carry within their constitution a millstone that will sink them to the bottom of the sea. They do not acknowledge that God has placed his Christ on his throne. They will not honor the Son. Society under their rule is not blessed. The land mourns because of the wickedness of those in high positions. Ignorance, poverty, and crime abound because of the injustice and wrongdoing of those who guide the destinies of nations. Men who do not fear God, do not love his Son, and do not respect the principles of his government still wield the sword and hold the scepter in all lands.

This is completely opposed to the peace and happiness of the world. Therefore, he will shatter them like a potter’s vessel and establish a society in which justice, unyielding justice, will have absolute dominion. Jesus will be universally acknowledged by all living people, and all nations will honor him. This state of society will be the fulfillment of the Christian religion, in all its moral influence and impact on humanity.

How much of this change will be brought about by moral means, and how much by physical means, is not the subject of our current inquiry. But the preparation of a people for the coming of the Lord must result from the restoration of the ancient gospel and order of things. Whenever it comes, the day of the regeneration of the world will be as wonderful and terrible as the day of the flood, the judgment of Sodom, or the destruction of Jerusalem. Who will stand when the Lord does this?

But all regenerations—physical and moral, individual, congregational, or national—are only types and shadows, or means of preparation for the —

## Regeneration of the Heavens and the Earth

The Bible begins with the creation of the heavens and the earth; but the Christian revelation ends with the regeneration, or new creation, of the heavens and the earth. This is the ancient promise of God, confirmed to us by the Christian Apostles. The present elements are to be changed by fire. The old, pre-flood earth was purified by water; but the present earth is reserved for fire, along with all the works of man upon it. It will be transformed into a lake of molten fire. But those who die in Christ will have been regenerated in body before the old earth is regenerated by fire. The bodies of the saints will be as compatible with the new earth and heavens as their current bodies are with the present heavens and earth. God recreates, regenerates, but annihilates nothing; therefore, the present earth is not to be destroyed. The best description we can give of this regeneration is in the words of one who had a vision of it on the island of Patmos. He describes it as far as it relates to the New Jerusalem, which will stand on the new earth, under the canopy of the new heaven: —

'And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away; and there was no longer any sea. I, John, saw the holy city, the New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”'

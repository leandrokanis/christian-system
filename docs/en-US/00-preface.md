# Preface

**Since** the full development of the great apostasy foretold by Prophets and Apostles, numerous attempts at reformation have been made. Three full centuries, carrying with them the destinies of countless millions, have passed into eternity since the Lutheran effort to dethrone the Man of Sin. During this period, many great and wonderful changes have taken place in the political, literary, moral, and religious conditions of society. That the nations composing the western half of the Roman Empire have already been greatly benefited by that effort, scientifically, politically, and morally, no person acquainted with either political or ecclesiastical history can reasonably doubt. Time, that great arbiter of human actions, that great revealer of secrets, has long decided that all the reformers of the Papacy have been public benefactors. And thus the Protestant Reformation is proved to have been one of the most splendid eras in the history of the world and must long be regarded by philosophers and philanthropists as one of the most gracious interpositions on behalf of the whole human race.

We Americans owe our national privileges and our civil liberties to the Protestant reformers. They achieved not only an imperishable fame for themselves but a rich legacy for their descendants. When we contrast the present state of these United States with Spanish America and the condition of the English nation with that of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, we begin to appreciate how much we are indebted to the intelligence, faith, and courage of Martin Luther and his heroic associates in that glorious reformation.

He restored the Bible to the world in A.D. 1534 and boldly defended its claims against the impious and arrogant pretensions of the haughty and tyrannical See of Rome. But, unfortunately, at his death, there was no Joshua to lead the people, who rallied under the banners of the Bible, out of the wilderness in which Luther died. His tenets were soon converted into a new state religion, and the spirit of reformation that he excited and inspired was soon quenched by the conflicts and feuds of the Protestant princes and the collisions of rival political interests, both on the continent and in the islands of Europe.

While Protestant hatred toward the Roman Pontiff and the Papacy continued to increase, a secret desire in the hearts of Protestants for ecclesiastical power and patronage worked in the members of the Protestant Popes, who gradually assimilated the new church to the old. Creeds and manuals, synods and councils soon shackled the minds of men, and the spirit of reformation gradually forsook the Protestant church or was supplanted by the spirit of the world.

Calvin renewed the speculative theology of Saint Augustine, and Geneva in a few years became the Alexandria of modern Europe. The power of religion was soon merged in debates about forms and ceremonies, in speculative disputes of opinion, and in fierce debates about the political and religious right of burning heretics. Still, however, in all these collisions, much light was elicited; and had it not been for these extremes, it is questionable whether the wound inflicted upon the _Man of Sin_ would have been as incurable as it has since proven to be.

Reformation, however, became the order of the day; and this, assuredly, was a significant matter, however it may have been managed! It was a revolution, and revolutions seldom move backward. The example that Luther set was of more value than all the achievements of Charles V. or the literary and moral labors of his distinguished contemporary, the learned Erasmus.

It is curious to observe how extremes begot extremes in every step of the reformation cause, leading up to the dawn of the present century. The penances, works of faith, and supererogation of the Roman church drove Luther and Calvin to the extreme of "faith alone."

After the Protestants had debated their own principles with one another until they lost all brotherly affection and would as soon have "communed in the sacrament" with the Catholics as with one another; speculative abstracts of Christian Platonism and the sublime mysteries of Egyptian theology became alternately the bond of union and the source of discord among the fathers and friends of the reformation.

The _five_ great dogmas of the Geneva reformer were carried to Amsterdam and generated in the mind of James Arminius in 1591 five opposite opinions; and these at the synod of Dort, in 1618, formed a new party of Remonstrants.

Into Britain, with whose history we are more immediately concerned, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Arminianism were soon imported; and, like all raw materials introduced there, were immediately manufactured anew. They were all exotics but easily acclimated and soon flourished in Britain more luxuriantly than in their native soil. But the meager elements of opinions, forms, and ceremonies to which they gave rise caused the _"Spirit alone"_ to germinate in the mind of George Fox, in little more than half a century after the introduction of the Leyden theology.

In Lord Chatham's days, the Episcopal church, as his Lordship declares, was a singular compound — "A Popish liturgy, Calvinistic articles, and an Arminian clergy." But every few years caused a new dissension and reformation until the kirk of Scotland and the church of England have been compelled to respect, to some degree, the rights of conscience, even in dissenters themselves.

Abroad it was no better. The Saxon reformer had his friends; John of Picardy lived in the grateful remembrance of the Geneva family; and James of Amsterdam speculated in a very liberal style among all the Remonstrants at home and abroad. In Sweden, Holland, Germany, England, Scotland, the debate varied not essentially: the Pope against the Protestants — the Lutherans against the Calvinists — the Calvinists against the Arminians — the Bishops against the Presbyters — and the Presbyterians among themselves; until, by the influence of metaphysics and politics, they are now divided into various parties.

While philosophy, mysticism, and politics drove the parties to every question into opposing extremes; while justification by metaphysical faith alone; while the forms and ceremonies of all sects begat the "Spirit alone" in the mind of George Fox, while the Calvinian five points generated the Arminian five points; and while the Westminster Creed, though unsubscribed by its makers, begot a hundred others — not until within the present generation did any sect or party in Christendom unite and build upon the Bible alone.

Since that time, the first effort known to us to abandon the whole controversy about creeds and reformations, and to _restore_ primitive Christianity, or to build solely upon the Apostles and Prophets, with Jesus Christ himself as the chief cornerstone, has been made.

Tired of new creeds and new parties in religion, and of the numerous failed efforts to reform the reformation; convinced from the Holy Scriptures, from observation and experience, that the union of the disciples of Christ is essential to the conversion of the world, and that the correction and improvement of no creed or partisan establishment in Christendom could ever become the basis of such a union, communion, and cooperation, as would restore peace to a church militant against itself or triumph to the common salvation; a few individuals, around the beginning of the present century, began to reflect on the ways and means to restore primitive Christianity.

This led to a careful, conscientious, and prayerful examination of the grounds and reasons for the current state of things in all the Protestant sects. Upon examining the history of all the platforms and constitutions of these sects, it became evident as mathematical demonstration itself that neither the Augsburg articles of faith and opinion, nor the Westminster, nor the Wesleyan, nor those of any state creed or dissenting establishment could ever improve the condition of things, restore union to the church, peace to the world, or success to the gospel of Christ.

As the Bible was said and constantly affirmed to be the religion of Protestants, it was for some time a mysterious problem why the Bible alone, confessed and acknowledged, should work no happier results than the strife, divisions, and retaliatory excommunications of rival Protestant sects. It appeared, however, in this case, after a more intimate acquaintance with the details of the inner workings of sectarian Christianity, that it is not the acknowledgment of a good rule, but the adherence to it, that secures the happiness of society. The Bible on the lips, and the creed in the head and heart, will not save the church from strife, rivalry, and schism. There is no moral, ecclesiastical, or political good in simply acknowledging it in word. It must be obeyed.

In our ecclesiastical journey, we have occasionally encountered some vehement declaimers against human-written creeds and advocates for the Bible alone, who were all the while preaching the opinions of _Saint_ Arius or _Saint_ Athanasius. Their sentiments, language, style, and general views of the gospel were as human as auricular confession, extreme unction, or purgatorial purification.

The Bible alone is the Bible only, in word and deed, in profession and practice; and this alone can reform the world and save the church. Judging others, we once judged ourselves; there are not a few who are advocating the Bible alone and preaching their own opinions. Before we applied the Bible alone to our views or brought our views and religious practice to the Bible, we pleaded the old theme — "The Bible alone is the religion of Protestants." But we found it an arduous task, and one of twenty years' labor, to correct our language and purify our speech according to the Bible alone; and even now we have not wholly practically repudiated the language of Ashdod. We only profess to work and walk by the rules that will inevitably lead to a pure speech and in right conceptions of that pure, holy, and celestial thing called Christianity — in faith, in sentiment, and in practice.
A deep and lasting impression that the power, the comfort, and joys — the holiness and happiness — of Christ's religion were lost in the forms and ceremonies, in the speculations and conjectures, in the feuds and arguments of sects and divisions, led to a project many years ago for uniting the sects, or rather the _Christians_ in all the sects, on a clear and scriptural basis of unity — on having a _"thus saith the Lord,"_ either in direct terms or in approved precedent, "for every article of faith and item of religious practice." This was proposed in the year 1809, in the "Declaration and Address" of the Washington Association, Pennsylvania. It was first presented to those who adhered to the Westminster creed; but it was equally offered to Protestants of every name, making faith in Christ and obedience to Him the only test of Christian character and the only bond of church unity, communion, and cooperation. It was indeed approved by all; but adopted and practiced by none, except for a few, or part of the few, who made the proposal.

None of us who initiated or supported that project were aware of the havoc that said principle, if faithfully applied, would wreak on our views and practices regarding various favorite points. When we take a close retrospective look at the last thirty years (for we have a pretty clear recollection of our journey's history during that time), and of the workings of that principle in heart and life, with which we began our public career in the work of the Lord; we find it hard to express our astonishment better than in the following parable: — 

A citizen of the West had a very promising young vineyard on a fruitful hill. He had no practical knowledge in the cultivation of grapes; but had read extensively about the care, pruning, and management of the vine. He built himself a wine vat and prepared all the tools for the harvest. But he lacked practical skill in using the pruning knife. His vines flourished exceedingly and spread their tendrils in every direction; but he had no harvest.

One day, a vine dresser from Oporto presented himself while he was reflecting on his disappointments. He was well-known in his profession and the most skilled in all matters of the vineyard. The owner of the vineyard hired him to tend and care for his vineyard and set out on a long journey for a few weeks. Upon his return and visit to his farm, he walked out one day to his vineyard; when, to his amazement, he saw the ground literally covered with prunings from his vines. The vine dresser had skillfully and freely used the pruning hook, leaving little more than the roots and bare stems of the vines standing by the frames.

'My vineyard is ruined! My hopes are shattered! I am undone! I am ruined!' exclaimed the unhappy farmer. 'Unhappy wretch! You have deceived me; you have robbed me of the labor of five years and destroyed, in one single month, all my bright hopes for years to come!' The vine dresser stood shocked; but as the storm subsided, he ventured to say, — 'Master, I will serve you for five years for nothing if we do not gather more grapes and have a better vineyard this year than you have gathered in all the years since you planted these vines.' The owner of the vineyard withdrew, saying, — 'It is impossible! It is impossible!' and did not visit it again until invited by his vine dresser about the middle of autumn; when, to his even greater astonishment and much more to his satisfaction, he found incomparably more grapes than had ever been gathered from his vines, and of a much more delicious quality.

So in the case before us, the application of the principle already stated stripped us so bare that we strongly suspected its fallacy and nearly abandoned it as a deceptive speculation. Time, however, the great teacher, and Experience, that great critic, have fully assured us that the principle is a beneficial one, and that although we seem to lose much by its application, our loss consists only of barren opinions, fruitless speculations, and useless traditions that only clutter the ground and hinder the word, making it largely unfruitful.

We believe that the principles are now clearly and fully developed by the united efforts of a few devoted and passionate individuals, who set out determined to sacrifice everything for truth and follow her wherever she might lead: I say, the principles on which the church of Jesus Christ — all believers in Jesus as the Messiah — can be united with honor to themselves and with blessings to the world; on which the gospel and its ordinances can be restored in all their original simplicity, excellence, and power, and the church shine as a lamp that burns to the conviction and salvation of the world: — I say, the principles by which these things can be accomplished are now developed, as well as the principles themselves, which together constitute _the original gospel and order of things_ established by the Apostles.

The purpose of this volume is to present to the community in a clear, definite, and understandable style, the key principles that have been brought forth, argued, developed, and sustained in a controversy of _twenty-five years_, by the voices and writings of those who rallied under the banners of the Bible alone. The principle that was inscribed on our banners when we withdrew from the ranks of the sects was, _'Faith in Jesus as the true Messiah, and obedience to Him as our Lawgiver and King, the *only test* of Christian character, and the *only bond* of Christian unity, communion, and cooperation, regardless of all creeds, opinions, commandments, and traditions of men.'_

This cause, like every other, was first argued by word of mouth; later by writing and the press. The history of its progress corresponds with the history of every other religious revolution, in this respect — that different points, at different times, almost exclusively captured the attention of its advocates. We began with the *outposts* and vanguard of the opposition. As soon as we secured one position, our efforts were directed against another; and as quickly as the smoke of the enemy cleared, we advanced upon his lines.

The first piece written on the subject of the great position came from the pen of Thomas Campbell, Senior, in the year 1809. An association was formed that year for the dissemination of the principles of reformation; and the piece mentioned was titled "The Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington, Pennsylvania."

The foundational principle of this "Christian Association" and its purpose are clearly expressed in the following resolution: — "That this society, formed for the sole purpose of promoting simple evangelical Christianity, shall, to the best of its ability, support such ministers, and such only, as demonstrate a clear conformity to the _Original Standard_, in conversation and doctrine, in zeal and diligence; only those who practice the _simple original_ form of Christianity, as explicitly shown in the sacred text, without attempting to impose anything of human authority, private opinion, or inventions of men, as having any place in the constitution, faith, or worship of the Christian church; or anything as a matter of _Christian faith_ or _duty_, for which there cannot be produced a '_thus saith the Lord,_' either in direct terms or by approved precedent."

The ground covered in this resolution provided ample material for debate. Every inch of it was discussed, argued, and examined for several years in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio. On this foundation, we set sail, with barely enough hands to man the ship. We faced headwinds and rough seas for the first seven years. A history of that would be both curious and interesting.

But to distinguish this plea and effort from some others almost contemporaneous with it, we would emphasize that, while the opponents fought against human creeds, evidently because those creeds conflicted with their own private opinions and favorite doctrines, which they wished to replace those creeds with — this enterprise, so far as it was hostile to those creeds, opposed them, not because of their hostility to any private or favorite opinions that were desired to be substituted for them; but because those human institutions supplanted the Bible, rendered the word of God ineffective, were detrimental to the intelligence, unity, purity, holiness, and happiness of the disciples of Christ, and hostile to the salvation of the world.

Unitarians, for example, have opposed human creeds because those creeds taught Trinitarianism. Arminians, too, have been against creeds because those creeds supported Calvinism. It has indeed been claimed that all schismatics, good and bad, since the days of John Wycliffe, and long before, have opposed creeds of human invention because those creeds opposed them. But as far as their controversy resembles ours in its opposition to creeds, it is to be distinguished from ours in this all-important attribute, namely — that our _opposition to creeds arose from a conviction that whether the opinions in them were true or false, they were hostile to the unity, peace, harmony, purity, and joy of Christians; and adverse to the conversion of the world to Jesus Christ._

Next to our personal salvation, two objectives constituted the _summum bonum_, the supreme good, worthy of sacrificing all temporalities. The first was the unity, peace, purity, and harmonious cooperation of Christians — guided by an understanding enlightened by the Holy Scriptures; the other, the conversion of sinners to God. Our preferences and aversions on all religious questions arose from, and were controlled by, those all-consuming interests. From these began our campaign against creeds. We had not at first, and we do not now, have a favorite opinion or speculation that we would offer as a substitute for any human creed or constitution in Christendom.
We were not, in fact, initially aware of the impact our _principles_ would have on our opinions. However, we soon found our principles and opinions in conflict on certain points; and the question arose, _Should we sacrifice our principles for our opinions, or our opinions for our principles?_ We need not say that we were compelled to choose the latter; believing that our principles were superior to our opinions. Therefore, since we set sail on this journey, we have had to discard some opinions that were once as dear to us as they now are to those who have never considered the difference between principle and opinion.

Some of these opinions — (like the most delicate and tender buds that are quickly blighted by frost) — immediately withered and died under the first application of our principles. Infant baptism and infant sprinkling, along with all infantile foolishness, quickly faded from our minds as soon as the _Bible_ was established as the sole measure and standard of faith and duty. This foundation of the Paidobaptist structure was instantly destroyed, and the entire edifice that relied on it became a heap of ruins. We explored the ruins diligently and gathered all the materials that could be used to build the Christian temple; but the piles of debris that remained were immense.

Other topics became the focus of discussion; and as the public mindset became more informed and open, the great principles of the Law and Gospel, the Patriarchal, Jewish, and Christian Institutions were gradually revealed. Other publications in 1816 and 1820 greatly contributed to this development; and by 1823, the plan was formed to start a periodical and establish a press to advocate for the original faith and order, in opposition to all the corruptions of fifteen centuries.

As we are not writing a history of this struggle from its beginning to the present time, but simply informing the reader that the principles stated in the following pages have been thoroughly considered and have undergone a long, complicated, and vigorous opposition, — we will quickly move to the purpose of this book, which is to present a concise overview of the principles already mentioned.

To say nothing of the periodicals that have already been started, which have been our fellow workers in this crucial task, in addition to our publications from 1820, 1823, and 1829, four editions of the new version of the New Testament, with prefaces, various tables, notes, criticisms, etc.; there have been published from our press _twelve volumes_ illustrating and defending these principles; addressing and responding to objections from all sects, and from many of the most learned and talented individuals in our country.

The *Christian Baptist*, in seven annual volumes, being the first of these publications, and providing such a gradual development of all these principles as the state of public opinion and opposition would allow, is, in the view of many of our brethren who have commented on the subject, better suited to the entire community as it currently exists than our other writings. I must agree with this assessment; and to it especially, as well as to all other publications that have since begun, I would refer the reader who may wish to examine these principles more thoroughly and consider the challenges they have faced.

Having given careful and thoughtful attention to all that has been said against these principles, as well as having been warned about the extremes to which some of our friends and brethren have taken certain points, I undertake this work with a strong sense of its necessity and with high hopes for its usefulness, in presenting a focused view of the entire ground we occupy — correcting some extremes — and providing new means of defense for those engaged in contending with this generation for primitive Christianity.

Having also thoughtfully considered the most vulnerable aspects of every major question, and re-examined the terms and phrases that have caused the most opposition and controversy, whether from our own writing or that of any of our brethren, — our goal now is to offer the public a more developed view of such fundamental principles as are necessary for the correct interpretation of the Holy Scriptures — both in acquiring and communicating an accurate understanding of the Christian Institution, of such principles as are essential for discovering truth and exposing error; as well as in a revised and corrected republication of the main Extras of the Millennial Harbinger, to present to the reader the elements of the gospel itself, and of the worship most pleasing to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The work, then, naturally divides itself into three parts: — The first, **The principles by which the Christian Institution may be certainly and satisfactorily determined:** the second, **The principles on which all Christians may form one communion:** and the third, **The elements or principles that constitute original Christianity**. Whether this arrangement is most in line with the order of nature or of importance is not the question; it is the order in which we have necessarily been compelled to consider these subjects.

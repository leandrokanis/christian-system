# Proposition 8

***The gospel contains a command, and as such must be obeyed.***

And here I only need to ask, Who will be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord? Paul replies, 'They who do not know God, and *do not obey the gospel of his Son.*'<sup>29</sup> To 'obey the gospel,' and to 'become obedient to the faith,' were common phrases in the apostolic teachings and writings. 'Through whom we have received apostleship, for the *obedience of faith* among all nations, for his name.'<sup>30</sup> 'By the command of the eternal God, the gospel is made known to all nations for the *obedience of faith.*'<sup>31</sup> 'A large number of the priests became obedient to the faith'<sup>32</sup> 'But they have not all obeyed the gospel;'<sup>33</sup> and, 'What will be the end of those who *do not obey the gospel*'?<sup>34</sup> From these statements, it is undeniably clear that either the gospel itself, taken as a whole, is a command, or that within it there is a command through the obedience of which salvation is received.

The obedience of the gospel is referred to as the obedience of faith in contrast to the obedience of law. Faith in God's promise through Jesus Christ is the principle from which obedience flows. Presenting the gospel as a command is an act of grace, as it engages the will and affections of people, and allows them to have assurance of their salvation, from which they would be necessarily excluded if no such act of obedience were available.

Whatever the act of faith may be, it inevitably becomes the line of distinction between the two states previously described. On one side, and on the other, humanity exists in quite different conditions. On one side, they are pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved: on the other, they are in a state of condemnation. This act is sometimes called immersion, regeneration, conversion; and, to make this act clear to everyone, we will take some time to confirm and illustrate it.

That a relationship or a state can be changed by an act, I hardly need to prove at this time; especially to those who understand that the acts of marriage, naturalization, adoption, and being born change the state of the individuals involved. However, rather than try to prove that a state can be changed by an act, I would rather ask if anyone has heard, knows, or can imagine a state being changed without some act? This point, being accepted by all rational individuals, we do not presume to prove. But a question may arise whether *faith* itself, or an act of obedience to some command or institution, is the act by which our state is changed.

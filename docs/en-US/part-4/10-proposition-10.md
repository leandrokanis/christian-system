# Proposition 10 

***I now proceed to show that immersion and the washing of regeneration are two biblical names for the same act, viewed from two different perspectives.*** 

The term *regeneration* appears only twice in the common version of the New Testament and not at all in the Old Testament. The first instance is in Matt. 19:28: "You who have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." Dr. George Campbell, following the punctuation adopted by Griesbach and substituting the word *renovation* for *regeneration,* translates it as, "That, at the *renovation,* when the Son of Man shall be seated on his glorious throne, you, my followers, will also sit upon twelve thrones," etc. *Genesis,* being the term used for *creation,* *palingenesia,* denotes the new creation — either literally at the resurrection of the dead, or figuratively at the beginning of the Christian era, or at the start of the Millennium. Josephus, the Jewish historian, referred to the return of Israel to their own land and institution as "The Regeneration" or "Palingenesia." 

No notable writer, critic, or expositor suggests that *regeneration* in Matt. 19 refers to what is known in theology as the *new birth* or *regeneration of the soul* — not even the Presbyterian Matthew Henry, nor Dr. Whitby, Campbell, Macknight, Thompson; nor, indeed, any writer I can recall having read. Regeneration in this passage indicates a state, a new state of affairs. We often use the term in the same way. The American Revolution was the regeneration of the country or the government. The beginning of the Christian era was a regeneration — so will be the creation of the new heavens and new earth. Since this is such a clear matter and widely accepted, we move on to the second occurrence of this term. 

"God saved us by *the washing of regeneration* and renewing of the Holy Spirit." God has saved us through the *bath of regeneration* and the renewing of the Holy Spirit. This is the second time the word *regeneration* appears in the New Testament; and here it is acknowledged by the most learned Paidobaptists and Baptists that it refers to immersion. Although I have come to this conclusion based on my understanding of the Christian religion, I neither hold it myself nor justify it to others on this basis. I prefer to establish it through other testimonies than by those who agree with me on the meaning of this institution. Among these, I will include Dr. James Macknight, formerly the prolocutor or moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland and translator of the Apostolic Epistles. One of his notes on Titus 3:5 states: — "Through the bath of regeneration." "Through *baptism,* called the bath of regeneration, not because any change in nature" (but I would not say in the *state*) "of the baptized person is produced by baptism; but because it is an emblem of the purification of his soul from sin." He then quotes in support, (Acts 22:16.) "Arise, and be immersed, and wash away your sins." — *Paul.* He supports this view also from Eph. 5:26 and John 3:5. "The bath of regeneration," is then, according to this learned Paidobaptist, Christian immersion.

Parkhurst, in his Lexicon, connects the same *phrase,* the washing or bath of regeneration, with Eph. 5:26 and John 3:5, as referring to immersion. So say all the critics, one by one, as far as I know. Even Matthew Henry, the respected and venerable Presbyterian commentator, concedes this point as well, and quotes Eph. 5:26, Acts 22:16, and Matt. 28:19-20, in support of the conclusion that the *washing of regeneration* refers to baptism.

Our opponents themselves being judges, we have established this point, namely, that the only time the phrase *washing of regeneration* occurs in the New Testament, with reference to a personal change, it means, or is equivalent to, immersion. *Washing of regeneration and immersion are therefore just two names for the same thing.* Although I might be justified in moving on to another topic and assuming this point is fully established, I prefer, for the sake of *those who are slow to understand,* to reinforce this conclusion with some additional testimonies and arguments.

As regeneration is taught to be equivalent to "*being born again,*" and understood to have the same meaning as a new birth, we will examine it under this metaphor. For if immersion is equivalent to regeneration, and regeneration is the same as being born again, then being born again and being immersed are the same thing; for this simple reason: things that are equal to the same thing are equal to one another. *Everyone must agree that no one can be born again of that which they receive.* Just as no one is born naturally — no one can be born again, or born metaphorically — of that which they receive. It undermines the idea, the figure, the allusion, and everything else that justifies the application of these words to any change that occurs in a person, to suggest that the subject of the new birth, or regeneration, is born again of something they have received. This single observation highlights the inappropriateness and inaccuracy of thought; or perhaps, the lack of thought that popular notions of regeneration endorse and perpetuate.

In being born naturally, there is the begetter and that which is begotten. These are not the same. The act of being born is different from that which is born. Now the Scriptures carry this figure through every significant point of coincidence. There is the begetter. "Of his own will he has begotten or impregnated us," says James the Apostle. "*By the word of truth,*" as the incorruptible seed; or, as Peter says, "We are born again, not from corruptible, but from incorruptible seed, the word of God which endures forever." But when the act of being born is mentioned, then the water is introduced. Hence, before we enter the kingdom, we are born of water.

The Spirit of God is the begetter, the gospel is the seed; and being thus begotten and quickened, we are born of the water. A child is alive before it is born, and the act of being born only changes its state, not its life. Just so in the metaphorical birth. People are begotten by the Spirit of God, impregnated by the word, and born of the water.

In one sense, a person is born of their father; but not until they are first born of their mother. So in every instance where water and the Spirit, or water and the Word, are mentioned, *the water comes first.* Every child is born of its father when it is born of its mother. Hence the Savior placed the mother first, and the Apostles follow him. No other reason can be given for placing the water first. How consistent this style is! Jesus says to Nicodemus, "You must be born again, or you cannot discern the reign of God." *Born again!* What does this mean? "Nicodemus, unless you are born of water and the Spirit, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God." So Paul speaks to the Ephesians in 5:26, "He cleansed the church," or the disciples, "by *a bath of water, and the Word.*" And to Titus he says, "He saved the disciples *by the bath* of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit." Now, as soon as, and not before, a disciple who has been begotten of God is born of water, he is born of God, or of the Spirit. *Regeneration is, therefore, the act of being born.* Hence its connection always with water. Reader, reflect — what a mess, what a confusion, have the mystic doctors made of this metaphorical expression and this topic of regeneration. To call the receiving of any spirit, or any influence, or energy, or any operation upon the heart of man, regeneration, is an abuse of language, as well as a departure from the terminology of the Holy Spirit, *who calls nothing personal regeneration, except the act of immersion.*

Some curious criticisms have been offered to escape the clear declaration of Jesus and his Apostles on this subject. Some say that the words, "Except a man be born of water and Spirit," should not be understood literally. Surely, then, if being born of water does not mean being born of water, then being born of the Spirit must mean something other than being born of the Spirit. This is so fanatical and extravagant that it needs no further exposure. He who cannot see the appropriateness of calling immersion a being born again can see no appropriateness in any metaphor in common use. A resurrection is a new birth. Jesus is said to be the *firstborn* from the dead because he was the first to rise from the dead to die no more. And surely, there is no abuse of language, but the greatest appropriateness in saying that he who has died to sin and been buried in water, when raised up again out of that element, is born again or regenerated. If Jesus was born again when he came out of a tomb, surely he is born again who is raised up out of the grave of waters. 

Those who are thus begotten and born of God are children of God. It would be a monstrous assumption that such individuals are not freed from their sins. *To be born of God and born in sin is conceivable.* Remission of sins is as certainly granted to "*the born of God,*" as eternal life and deliverance from corruption will be granted to the *children of the resurrection* when born from the grave. 

To illustrate what we presume has now been proven, we will consider *political regeneration.* Although the term *regeneration* is loosely used in this context; yet, through such a license of speech, we may clarify this subject for everyone's understanding. Yes, the whole subject of faith, change of heart, regeneration, and character. 

All civilized nations and kingdoms have constitutions; and in their constitutions, they have declared who are members of the social compact. Besides those who make up the community at the time a constitution is adopted, they specify who shall participate in its blessings in all future times; that is, who shall be admitted into it, and by what means they shall become members of it. They have always decreed that their own descendants shall inherit their political rights and privileges. But they have also ordained that foreigners; that is, members of other communities, may become, by adoption or naturalization, citizens or fellow members of the same community. However, they have, in their wisdom and benevolence, instituted a rite or form of adoption, which has significant meaning; and which, when undergone, changes the state of the subject of it. Now, as the Savior consented to be called a *King* and to refer to the community over which he presides as a *Kingdom,* it was because of the analogy between these human institutions and his institution; and for the purpose not of confusing, but of aiding the human mind in understanding and comprehending the great object of his mission to the world. And it is worthy of the most emphatic attention that it was **when speaking of a kingdom that he spoke of being born again**. Yes, on that occasion, and on that occasion only, when he spoke of *entering into his kingdom,* did he mention the necessity of **being born again**. And had he not chosen that figure, he would not have selected the figure of *a new birth.* With these facts and circumstances before us, let us examine political regeneration as the best conceivable illustration of religious regeneration.
A. B. was born on the island of Great Britain, a native subject of George III, king of Great Britain. He was very attached to his native island, to the people, the customs, and traditions of his ancestors and relatives. With all these attachments still growing, he grew up to adulthood. Then he heard about this good land, this large, fertile, and highly desirable country. The country, the people, and the government were presented to him in the most favorable light. Sometimes these representations were exaggerated; but still, he could separate the truth from the fiction: and he was fully convinced not only of the existence of these United States but also of the desirability of being a citizen there. He believed the testimony he heard, resolved to leave the land of his birth, to risk life and property, putting himself aboard a ship, and saying goodbye to all the friends of his youth, his relatives, and dear friends. His conviction was so strong, and his faith so unwavering, that old Neptune and King Eolus, with all their terrors, could not frighten him. He sailed from his native shores and landed on this continent. However, he was unaware of many things related to this new country and government; and upon his arrival, he asked about the rights and privileges of a citizen. He was told that the civil rights of hospitality to a *stranger* could be extended to him as a *friendly alien;* but none of the rights or privileges of a *citizen* could be his unless he were born again.  "*Born again!*" he said, in a disappointed tone to Columbus, with whom he had his first conversation on the subject. "What do you mean by being born again?" 

*Columbus.* — You must be *naturalized,* or adopted as a citizen; or, what we call *born again.* 

*A. B.* — I do not understand you. How can a man be born when he is grown? 

*Col.* — That which is born of Great Britain is British, and that which is born of America is American. If you want to be an American citizen, you must be born of America. 

*A. B.* — 'Born of America!' You surprise me. I have come to America, well-disposed toward the people and the country. I was once attached to England, but I became attached to the United States; and because of my faith and attachments, I have come here; and will you not accept me into your kingdom because I could not help being born in England? 

*Col.* — As well-disposed as I am, and we are, to receive you, I must assure you that unless you are regenerated in a courthouse and have been enfranchised by and before the judges, you can never become a citizen of these United States. 

*A. B.* — Yours is an arbitrary and despotic government. What airs of sovereignty you have assumed! 

*Col.* — By no means. Right, reason, wisdom, policy, and benevolence for you, as well as the safety, dignity, and happiness of the whole community, require that every alien shall be naturalized or made a citizen before he can exercise or enjoy the rights of a citizen. 

*A. B.* — You are certainly arbitrary — if not in the act of regeneration — in the place and manner in which it shall be done. Why, for instance, say that it must be done in a *courthouse?* 

*Col.* — I will tell you; because there are the *judges,* the *records,* and the *seal* of the government. 

*A. B.* — I understand you. Well, tell me, how is a man born again? Tell me plainly and without a figure. 

*Col.* — With pleasure. You were born of your mother and father when you were born in England; and you were born *legitimately,* according to the institutions of England. Well, then, you were born *of* England, as well as born *in* it; and were, therefore, wholly English. This was your first birth. But you have expatriated yourself, as your application here proves — I say *sentimentally* you have expatriated yourself; but we must have a formal *solemn pledge* of your renunciation; and we will give you a formal pledge of your adoption. You must, *ex animo,* in the presence of the Judges and the Recorders, renounce all allegiance to every foreign prince and potentate, and especially to His Majesty the King of Great Britain. 

*A. B.* — Is that the requirement? I can, with all my heart, renounce all *political* allegiance to every foreign prince and government. Is that all? I have no objection to that. 

*Col.* — There is this also: — You are not only to renounce all political allegiance; but you must also, from the soul, solemnly vow, in the presence of the same Judges and Recorders, that you will adopt and submit to the constitution and government of these United States. 

*A. B.* — I can do that too. I can renounce, and I can adopt; nor do I object to the place where it shall be done. But, pray, what solemn pledge will *you give me!* 

*Col.* — As soon as you have vowed renunciation and adoption in the presence of the Judges and Recorders, we will give you a certificate, with a *red seal,* the *seal of the state,* attached to it; stating that you, having now been naturalized, or born according to our institutions, are born *of* America; and are now a son, an adopted son, of America. And that *red* seal indicates that the blood, the best blood of this government, will be shed for you, to protect you and defend you; and that your life will, when called for, be willingly given up for your mother, *of* whom you have been politically born; as it would have been for your own natural political mother, of whom you were first born. 

*A. B.* — To this I must agree. In my mother tongue, it all means that I give myself up politically to this government, and it gives itself up to me, before witnesses too. How soon, pray, after this new birth may I exercise and enjoy all the rights of a citizen? 

*Col.* — They are yours the first breath you take under your new mother. It is true, we do not have, in these United States, any *symbol* through which a person is politically regenerated. We only ask for a solemn pledge and give one. Some nations have symbols. But we understand that the moment the vow is taken, the person is politically born again. And just as every other child has all the rights of a child which it can exercise as soon as it inhales the air; so do all our political children have all political rights as soon as the process of naturalization is completed. But remember, *not until then.* 

*A. B.* — You say some nations had their symbols. What do you mean by these? 

*Col.* — I mean that the naturalized had to submit to some emblematic rite, by which they were symbolically detached from every other people and introduced among those who adopted them, and whom they adopted. The Indian nations wash all whom they adopt in a running stream and impose this task upon their females. The Jews circumcised and washed all whom they admitted to the rights of their institutions. Other customs and forms have been used in other nations; but we regard simply the meaning of the act and have no symbol. 

*A. B.* — In this, I feel little interest. I wish to become a citizen of these United States; especially as I am informed I can have *no* inheritance among you, nor a *voice* in the nation, nor any privileges unless I am born again. 

*Col.* — You must, then, submit to the institution; and I know that as soon as you are politically born again, you will feel more of the importance and utility of this institution than you can now; and will be just as eager as I am to see others submit to this wise, wholesome, and benevolent institution. 

*A. B.* — As my faith brought me to your shores, and as I approve of your constitution and government, I will not (now that I understand your institutions) let an opportunity pass. I will direct my course to the place where I can be born again. 

I ought here to offer an apology for a phrase occurring frequently in this essay and in this dialogue. When we represent the subject of immersion as active, either in so many words or impliedly, we so far depart from that style which aligns with the figure of "*being born.*" For all persons are passive in being born. So, in immersion, the subject does not bury himself, nor does he raise himself; but is buried and raised by another. So that in the act, the subject is always passive. And it is of that act alone of which we thus speak. 

From all that has been said on *regeneration,* and from the illustration just now presented, the following conclusions must, we think, be apparent to all: —  

***First.*** Begetting and quickening necessarily precede being born. 

***Second.*** Being born imparts no new life; but is simply *a change of state,* and introduces into *a new mode of living.* 

***Third.*** Regeneration, or immersion — the former referring to the meaning of the act, and the latter term to the act itself — denote only the act of being born. 

***Fourth.*** God, or the Spirit of God, being the author of the whole institution, imparting to it its life and efficiency, is the *begetter,* in the fullest sense of that term. Yet, in a subordinate sense, anyone skilled in the word of God, who converts another, may be said to have begotten him whom he enlightens. So Paul says, 'I have begotten Onesimus in my bonds:' — and 'I have begotten you, Corinthians, through the gospel.' 

***Fifth.*** The gospel is declared to be *the seed;* — the power and strength of the Holy Spirit to impart life. 

***Sixth.*** And the great argument, relevant to our purpose, in this long examination of conversion and regeneration, is that which we believe to be the most apparent of all other conclusions, namely: — that remission of sins, or coming into a state of acceptance, being one of the present privileges of the Kingdom of Heaven, cannot be scripturally enjoyed by any person before immersion. Just as one cannot be a citizen before he is born, or have the privileges of an American citizen while an alien; so one cannot enjoy the privileges of a son of God before he is born again. For Jesus expressly declares that he has not given the privilege of sons to anyone but those born of God. If, then, the present forgiveness of sins is a privilege and a right of those under the new constitution, in the kingdom of Jesus; and if being born again, or being born of *water* and of the Spirit, is necessary for admission; and if being born of *water* means *immersion,* as clearly proven by all witnesses; then, remission of sins cannot, in this life, be constitutionally enjoyed prior to immersion. If there is any proposition regarding any aspect of the Christian institution that admits clearer proof or fuller illustration than this one, I have yet to learn where it may be found.
But before we move on from the sixth piece of evidence, which includes so many points, I’d like to make a couple of remarks about the appropriateness of considering the term "immersion" as equivalent to the term "conversion."

"Conversion" is generally understood to mean turning to God. It’s not just thinking positively about God or feeling regret for past wrongs; it’s an actual turning to God, in both word and action. It’s true that no one can be said to turn to God unless their mind is enlightened and their heart is inclined toward Him. All human actions that don’t come from prior thought or intention are more like the actions of a machine than those of a rational being. "He who comes to God," or turns to Him, "must believe that God exists, and that He rewards everyone who diligently seeks Him." Then they will seek and find the Lord. An "external conversion" is no conversion at all. Turning to God with words while the heart is far from Him is mere pretense and mockery. However, I have always understood the "turning to God" taught in the New Testament to mean coming to the Lord Jesus—not just *thinking* about doing it or *repenting* for not having done it, but an *actual coming* to Him. The question then is, Where can we find Him? Where can we meet Him? Nowhere on earth but in His institutions. "Where He records His name," there alone can He be found; for there only has He promised to be found. I assert that the first institution in which we can meet with God is the institution for remission. It’s worth noting that the Apostles, in all their speeches and responses to questions, never commanded an inquirer to pray, read, or sing as a prerequisite to coming; they always commanded and proclaimed immersion as the first duty or the first thing to be done after believing the testimony. Therefore, neither praying, singing, reading, repenting, feeling sorrow, resolving, nor waiting to be better was the act of conversion. Immersion *alone* was the act of turning to God. Thus, in the commission to convert the nations, the only institution mentioned after proclaiming the gospel was the immersion of believers, as the divinely authorized way to carry out and complete the work. From the day of Pentecost to the final *Amen* in the revelation of Jesus Christ, no one was said to be converted or to turn to God until they were buried and raised up out of the water.

If I were not treating this subject as one of questionable debate, I would say that if there hadn’t been some act, such as immersion, universally agreed upon as the means of remission and the act of conversion and regeneration, the Apostles could not, with any regard for truth and consistency, have addressed the disciples as pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, and saved individuals. If all this had depended on some mental change, like faith, they could never have addressed their congregations in any other way than the moderns do: and that is always the language of doubt and uncertainty—hoping a little and fearing a lot. This comparison between their mode of address and the modern one is clear evidence that they viewed the immersed through one lens, while we view them through another. They taught the disciples to consider not only themselves as saved individuals but also all whom they saw or knew to be immersed into the Lord Jesus. They greeted everyone coming out of the water as *saved* and recorded them as such. Luke writes, "The Lord added *the saved* daily to the congregation."

Whenever a child is born into a family, it is a brother or sister to all other children in that family; and being born of the same parents is the act that causes and declares its brotherhood. Everything is mental and invisible before coming out of the water; and since immersion is the first act commanded and the first constitutional act, it was in the commission *the act* by which the Apostles were commanded to turn or convert those to God who believed their testimony. In *this* sense, then, it is the converting act. No one can, scripturally, be said to be converted to God until they are immersed. How ecclesiastics interpret their own language is not our concern. We advocate for pure speech and for the apostolic ideas attached to it.

To return to the direct testimonies declaring the remission of sins by immersion, we turn to the Gentiles. Peter was sent to the house of Cornelius to tell him and his family "words by which they might be saved." He shares these words. He was interrupted by the miraculous descent of the Holy Spirit. But it’s important to note that the testimony to which the Holy Spirit affixed its seal was the following words: — "To *him* all the prophets bear witness, that everyone who believes in him *shall receive remission of sins through his name.*" While speaking these words about remission of sins by, or through His name, the Holy Spirit, in its miraculous gifts of tongues, fell upon them.

Many, seeing so much emphasis placed on faith or belief, assume that all blessings flow from it *immediately.* This is a significant misunderstanding. Faith, indeed, is the principle, and the distinguishing principle of this system: but it is only the principle of action. Hence, we find the name or person of Christ always interposed between faith and the healing, whether mental or physical. The woman who touched the hem of Jesus’ garment had as much faith before as after; but although her faith prompted her to reach out her hand, and accompanied it, *she was not healed until the touch.* That great symbol of Christ, the bronze serpent, healed no Israelite simply by faith. The Israelites, as soon as they were bitten, believed it would heal them. But they were not healed immediately after being bitten, nor until *they looked* at the serpent. It was one thing to believe that looking at the serpent would heal them, and another to actually look at it. It was *the faith,* indirectly; but *immediately, the look,* that healed them. It was not faith in the waters of Jordan that healed the leprosy of Naaman the Syrian. It was immersing himself in it, according to the command. It was not faith in the pool of Siloam that cured the blind man, whose eyes Jesus anointed with clay; it was his washing his eyes in Siloam’s water. Thus, the imposition of hands, a word, a touch, a shadow, or something from the persons of those anointed with the Holy Spirit was the *immediate* cause of all the healings recorded in the New Testament. It is also true that without faith it is impossible to be healed; for in some places, Jesus could not perform many miracles because of their unbelief. This applies to all moral remedies and cures. It is impossible to receive the remission of sins without faith. In this world of means (however it may be in a world without means), it is just as impossible to receive any blessing through faith without the appointed means. *Both are essential.* Hence, *the name* of the Lord Jesus is interposed between faith and forgiveness, justification and sanctification, even where immersion into that *name* is not explicitly mentioned. It would have been unprecedented in the history of the world for the historian always to have recorded all the circumstances of the same institution in every reference to it; and it would have been equally unusual for the Apostles to have mentioned it always in the same words. Thus, in the passage before us, the *name* of the Lord is only mentioned. Similarly, in the first letter to the Corinthians, the disciples are described as saved, washed, justified, and sanctified *by the name* of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God. The frequent interposition of the name of the Lord between faith and forgiveness, justification, sanctification, etc., is explained in a remark made by James in his speech in Jerusalem. It refers to an ancient prophecy concerning the conversion of the Gentiles. The Gentiles are described as turning to or seeking the Lord. But who are those who are thus converted? "Even all the Gentiles *upon whom* my name is called." It is, then, to those *upon whom* the name of the Lord is called that the name of the Lord communicates remission, justification, etc.

Some critical thinkers need to be reminded that just as they sometimes find forgiveness, justification, sanctification, etc., attributed to grace, the blood of Christ, or the name of the Lord without mentioning faith, we also sometimes find faith, grace, and the blood of Christ without mentioning water. Now, if they have any reason and right to claim that faith is understood in one case, we have the same reason and right to assert that water or immersion is understood in the other. Their argument is that in various places this matter is made clear enough. This is also our argument—in various places this matter is made clear enough. This single remark addresses all their objections based on the fact that immersion is not always found in every instance where *the name* of the Lord or *faith* is connected with forgiveness. Neither is grace, the blood of Christ, nor faith always mentioned with forgiveness. When they find a passage where remission of sins is mentioned without immersion, it is weak or unfair in the extreme to argue from that that forgiveness can be enjoyed without immersion.

***If their logic is worth anything, it will prove that a person may be forgiven without grace, the blood of Jesus, and without faith; for we can find many passages where remission, justification, sanctification, or some similar term occurs, with no mention of either grace, faith, or the blood of Jesus.***

As this is the crux, the essence, and the core of all the logic of our most clever opponents on this subject, I wish I could make it more emphatic than by printing it in capitals. I know some editors, some of our Doctors of Divinity, and some of our most learned speakers who make this argument, which we unhesitatingly call a genuine sophism, the Alpha and the Omega of their speeches against the meaning and indispensable importance of Christian immersion.
The New Testament would be a curious book if, every time *remission of sins* was mentioned or alluded to, it had been preceded by *grace, faith, the blood of Jesus, immersion, etc. etc.* But now the question arises, which, to the rational mind, is the crucial question — **do they think, believe, teach, and practice more wisely and safely, those who believe and teach that grace, faith, the blood of Jesus, the name of the Lord, and immersion are all essential to immediate pardon and acceptance; — or those who say that faith only, grace only, the blood of Christ only, the name of the Lord only — and immersion not at all**? To all men, women, and children of common sense, this question is presented.

It is, however, admirable to me that the remission of sins should be not merely unequivocally, but so repeatedly declared through *immersion,* as it is in the apostolic writings. And here I would ask the entire thinking community, one by one, whether, if the whole human race had been gathered on Pentecost, or in Solomon's portico, and had asked Peter the same question that the convicted proposed, would he have given them the same answer? Would he not have told the whole race to repent and be immersed for the remission of their sins? Or to repent and be *converted,* so that their sins might be blotted out? — to rise and be immersed, and wash away their sins? If he would not, let them provide a reason; and if they say he would, let them explain why they do not go and do likewise.

Some have objected to the "seasons of refreshment," or the comforts of the Holy Spirit being placed after "conversion," or "regeneration," or "immersion;" (for when we speak scripturally, we must use these terms as all referring to the same thing,) because the gifts of the Holy Spirit were poured out upon the Gentiles before immersion. They do not see the purpose of welcoming the Gentiles into the kingdom in this way. They forget the comparison of the Gentiles to a returning prodigal, and his father going out to meet him, even while he was still a good way off. God welcomed the first fruits of the Jews into his kingdom through a remarkable display of spiritual gifts, called *the baptism of the Holy Spirit,* before any of the Jews had been immersed into the Lord Jesus. And, as Peter explains this matter in Cornelius's case, it appears that God intended to make no distinction between the Jews and Gentiles in receiving them into his kingdom. Hence, Peter says, "he gave them *the same gift* which he gave to us Jews *at the beginning,*" (never since Pentecost.) Thus Peter was authorized to command those Gentiles to be immersed by the authority of the Lord, no one daring to forbid it. But these gifts of the Holy Spirit differed greatly from the seasons of refreshment, from the righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, the common experience of all who were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of sins.

Let it be noted here, as relevant to our current discussion, that as the Apostle Peter was interrupted by the baptism of the Holy Spirit when he began to speak of forgiveness by *the name* of the Lord Jesus; as soon as he saw that the Lord had accepted them, he commanded them to be immersed by the authority of the Lord. And here I must pose another question to both the learned and the unlearned. How is it that, although it is commanded only once that the nations who believe should be immersed into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; and although we read of no one being immersed into this name in this way; I ask, how is it that all sects use these words without hesitation and baptize or sprinkle in this name; when more than once people are commanded to be immersed *for the remission of sins,* and but few of the proclaimers can be persuaded to immerse for the remission of sins, despite it being so repeatedly taught and proclaimed by the Apostles? Is one command, unsupported by a single precedent, sufficient to justify this practice of Christians; and various commands and precedents from the same authority insufficient to authorize or justify us in immersing for the remission of sins? Answer this who can; I cannot, on any other principle than that the tyrant Custom, who gives no account of his actions, has so decreed.

I now come to another of the direct and positive testimonies of the Apostles, showing that immersion for the remission of sins is an institution of Jesus Christ. It is the address of Ananias to Saul: "Arise and be immersed and wash away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord." We have not yet discussed this testimony in this essay. It has been mentioned but not examined.

Paul, like the Pentecostian hearers, when convinced of the truth of the claims of the Messiah, asked what *he* should do. He was commanded to go into Damascus, and it would be told to him there what to do. It was told to him in the words now before us. But, some say, this cannot be understood literally.

For the sake of argument, then, take it figuratively. Of what was it figurative? Of something already received? Of pardon previously granted? A figure of the past?! This is unusual. I find one writer, and only one, who converts this into a *commemorative* baptism, like Israel's commemorating the escape from Egypt, or Christians commemorating the Lord's death. And, if I am not mistaken, some preacher said it was a figurative expression, similar to "*This is my body!*" One person, whom I pressed out of all these refuges, was candid enough to say he really did not know what it meant; but it could not mean that Paul was to be "baptized for the remission of his sins!"

"To wash away sins" is a figurative expression. Like other metaphoric expressions, it puts the resemblance in place of the proper word. It necessarily means something analogous to what is said. But we are said to be washed from our sins in, or by the blood of Christ. But even "*washed in blood*" is a figurative expression, and means something analogous to washing in water. Perhaps we may find in another expression a means of reconciling these strong metaphors. Rev. 7:14. "They have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." Here are two things equally incomprehensible — to wash garments *white* in blood, and to *wash away* sins in water! An efficacy is ascribed to water which it does not possess; and, as certainly, an efficacy is ascribed to blood which it does not possess. If blood can *whiten* or cleanse garments, certainly water can *wash away* sins. There is, then, a transferring of the efficacy of blood to water; and a transferring of the efficacy of water to blood. This is a straightforward solution of the whole matter. God has transferred, in some way, the whitening efficacy, or cleansing power of water, to blood; and the absolving or pardoning power of blood to water. This is done on the same principle as that of accounting faith for righteousness. What a gracious institution! God has opened a fountain for sin, for moral pollution. He has given it an extension as far and wide as sin has spread — as far and wide as water flows. Wherever water, faith, and the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are, there will be found the efficacy of the blood of Jesus. Yes, as God first gave the efficacy of water to blood, he has now given the efficacy of blood to water. This, as was said, is figurative; but it is not a figure that misleads, for the meaning is given without a figure, namely immersion for the remission of sins. And to him who made the washing of clay from the eyes, the washing away of blindness, it is competent to make the immersion of the body in water effective for the washing away of sin *from the conscience.*

From the conscience, I say; for there its malignity is felt; and it is only in releasing the conscience from guilt, and its consequences — fear and shame, that we are released from the dominion of sin, or washed from its pollution in this world. Thus immersion, says Peter, *saves* us, not by cleansing the body from its filth, but the conscience from its guilt; yes, immersion saves us by burying us with Christ, raising us with him, and so our consciences are purified from dead works to serve the living God. Hence our Lord gave so much importance to immersion in giving the commission to convert the world — "*He that believes and is immersed shall be saved.*"

But, while viewing the water and blood as made to unite their powers, as certainly as Jesus came by water and blood, we ought to consider another testimony given to this gracious combination of powers, by Paul the Apostle: "Being sprinkled in heart from an evil conscience, and being washed in body with clear water."

The application of water, the cleansing element, to the body, is made in this gracious institution to reach the conscience, as did the blood of sprinkling under the law.

Some ask, How can water, which does not penetrate the skin, reach the conscience? They boast of such an objection, as exhibiting great intellect and good sense. But little do they think that in so talking, they mock the whole Divine Economy, under the Old and New Institutions: for, I ask, did not the sacrifices and Jewish purifications somehow reach the conscience of that people? If they did not, it was all mere frivolity throughout. And can eating bread and drinking wine not influence or affect the soul? And cannot *the breath* of one person pierce the heart of another, and so move his blood, as to make his head a fountain of tears? He who objects to water and the significance of immersion objects to the whole remedial institution, as taught by Moses and by Christ, and insults the wisdom and goodness of God in the entire scheme of salvation. And he who objects to water, because it can only take away the filth of the flesh, ought rather to object to blood; because it rather smears and pollutes than cleanses the body, and cannot touch the soul. But all such reasoners are foolish talkers. To submit to God's institution is our wisdom and our happiness. The experience of the countless individuals who were immersed for the remission of their sins, detailed in the Christian scriptures, to say nothing of those immersed in our times, is worth more than volumes of arguments from the lips and pens of those who can only regard and venerate the traditions of their fathers; because it is presumed their fathers were wiser and more able to judge correctly than their children.
But since our goal is not to quote and elaborate on all the sacred testimonies, both direct and indirect, regarding immersion for the remission of sins, we will conclude the proof and illustration of this proposition with a reference to the cleansing power of this practice, found in the 2nd Epistle of Peter. After listing the qualities that are necessary to secure our calling and election, of which *courage* is the first and charity, or universal love, is the last, the Apostle states that "he who lacks these qualities is blind, closing his eyes, and forgetting that he was *purified from his old sins.*" I need not mention here that this is, perhaps, (and certainly as far as I know,) universally understood to refer to Christian immersion. The "*old sins,*" or "*former sins,*" can, we assume, refer only to those sins washed away in immersion. No one has yet attempted to show that these words can mean anything else. It is one of the clearest, and because it is incidental, one of the most decisive proofs that, in Peter's view, all former sins were forgiven in immersion. We began our proof of this position with Peter, and we will conclude it with Peter. He first proclaimed reformation for the remission of sins; and in his last and farewell letters to the Christian communities, he reminds them of that purification from sin received in and through immersion; and in the strongest terms warns them against forgetting that they were so purified.

If anyone were to reason about the simple meaning of the action commanded by Jesus, I think it could be shown from the action itself, in its two parts, *the burial and the resurrection,* that it must encompass everything we have heard the Apostles attribute to it. Corruption literally goes down into the grave; but does corruption come out of it? Is there no change of state in the grave? Who expects to come out of the grave in the same state in which they entered it? The firstborn from the dead did not; nor will any of those who fall asleep in him. How, then, can it be that anyone buried with Christ in immersion can rise with Christ and not rise in a new state? Surely the Apostle encourages a new life from the change of state brought about in immersion. "Since, indeed, you have been raised with Christ, set your minds on things above." Walk in a new life.

Lastly, is a child in the same state after birth as before? Is not its state changed? And does it not live a new life compared to its former way of living? As newborn babies crave the milk of the breast, so let the newly regenerated desire the pure milk of the Word, so that they may grow through it. Call immersion, then, a new birth, a washing of regeneration, or a resurrection, and its meaning remains the same. And when referred to in this way, it must imply that change of state which is involved in putting on Christ, in being pardoned, justified, sanctified, adopted, reconciled, and saved, which was the main proposition to be proved and illustrated, and which we believe has been proven and illustrated by the preceding testimonies and reflections.

Though no article of Christian faith or item of Christian practice can legitimately rest upon any testimony, reasoning, or authority outside the sacred writings of the Apostles, even if it is only one day after their passing; the views and practices of those who were contemporaries or students of the Apostles and their immediate successors may be presented as supporting evidence of the truths taught and the practices mandated by the Apostles; and, as such, may be cited; still keeping in mind that where the testimony of the Apostles ends, Christian faith necessarily concludes. After this preliminary remark, I proceed to support the following proposition: —

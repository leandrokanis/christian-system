# Proposition 11

***All the Apostolic Fathers, as they are called; all the students of the Apostles; and all the notable ecclesiastical writers from the first four Christian centuries, whose writings have been preserved, refer to and discuss Christian baptism as the "regeneration" and "remission of sins" mentioned in the New Testament.***

I will support this proposition with the testimony of those who have studied all Christian antiquity, and by citing the words of those commonly referred to as the Apostolic Fathers, along with other distinguished writers from the first four hundred years. We will first call upon one whose name is well-known throughout Christendom. Regardless of whether the writing is genuine or spurious, it is universally acknowledged to be a fragment of the highest antiquity: —

## Barnabas

In his Catholic Epistle, chapter 11, he says, "Let us now inquire whether the Lord took care to reveal anything beforehand concerning water and the cross. For the former, it is written to the people of Israel that they shall not receive that baptism which brings forgiveness of sins; but shall establish another for themselves that cannot. For thus says the Prophet, 'Be astonished, O Heavens! and let the earth tremble at it; because this people have committed two great and wicked things: They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and have dug for themselves broken cisterns that can hold no water. Is my holy mountain Zion a desolate wilderness? For she shall be like a young bird when its nest is taken away.' — 'Consider how he has joined both the *cross* and the *water* together. For this he says, '*Blessed are those who, putting their trust in the cross, descend into the water;* for they shall receive their reward in due time; then, he says, will I give it to them.' But concerning the present time, he says, 'Their leaves shall not wither.' Meaning that every word that comes out of your mouth, through faith and love, shall lead to the conversion and hope of many. In a similar manner, another Prophet speaks: 'And the land of Jacob was the praise of all the earth;' thereby magnifying the vessels of his Spirit. And what follows? 'And there was a river running on the right side, and beautiful trees grew up by it; and whoever eats of them shall live forever.' The meaning of this is: — *that we go down into the river full of sins and impurities; but come up again bearing fruit; having in our hearts the fear and hope that are in Jesus by the Spirit:* 'And whoever eats of them shall live forever.' That is, whoever listens to those who call them, and believes, shall live forever."

## Clement and Hermas

The former provides no testimony on the subject. The latter states the following.

In speaking of a tower built upon the water, which signifies the building of Christ's church, he says: — "Hear, therefore, why the tower is built on the waters: — Because your life is saved, and shall be saved, by water." In response to the question, "Why did the stones come up into this tower out of the deep?" he says it was necessary for them to come up by (or *through*) water, so they might find rest; "for they could not otherwise enter the kingdom of God; for before anyone *receives the name of the Son of God,* he is subject to death; but when he receives that *seal,* he is delivered from death and assigned to life. Now, that seal is *water,* into which people go down, subject to death, but come out assigned to life; for this reason, this seal was also preached to them; and they made use of it, so they might enter the Kingdom of God."

Both Clement and Hermas wrote around the end of the first century or the beginning of the second century.

Hermas also states the following in another work of his, called "The Commands of Hermas."

"And I said to him, I have just heard from certain teachers, and there is no other repentance besides that of *baptism,* when we go down into the water, and *receive the forgiveness of sins,* and after that, we should sin no more, but live in purity. And he said to me, *You have been rightly informed.*"

Having closely and repeatedly examined the Epistles of Clement; of Polycarp to the Philippians; of Ignatius to the Ephesians; that to the Magnesians; that to the Trallians, the Romans, the Philadelphians, the Smyrnians, and his Epistle to Polycarp; along with the Catholic Epistle of Barnabas, and the genuine works of Hermas, I can affirm that the preceding extracts are the only passages in all these writings that speak of baptism.

Having heard the Apostolic Fathers, as they are called, testify to the views of the students of the Apostles, down to A.D. 140; I will call upon a very learned Paidobaptist antiquarian, who can present every writer and Father, down to the fifth century; and before we hear any of his witnesses, we shall question him about his own beliefs after he has spent many years exploring all Christian antiquity: —

***Testimony of Dr. W. Wall, Author of the History of Baptism***

Pray, Doctor, have you examined all primitive writers from the death of John down to the fifth century?

*W. Wall.* — I have.

And will you explicitly affirm what was the established and universal view of all Christians, public and private, for four hundred years from the birth of the Messiah, regarding the meaning of the saying, (John 3:5,) "Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God?"

*W. Wall.* — "There is not a single Christian writer of any antiquity in any language who does not understand it as referring to *baptism;* and if it is not understood this way, it is difficult to explain how a person is born of *water,* any more than born of *wood.*"

Did all the Christians, public and private, and all the Christian writers from Barnabas to the times of Pelagius (419), as far as you know, continue to use the term *regenerate* as *only* applicable to baptism?

*W. Wall.* — "The Christians did, in all ancient times, continue to use this term '*regeneration*' for *baptism;* so that they *never* use the word '*regenerate,*' or '*born again,*' without meaning, or denoting by it, *baptism.* And almost all the quotations I will present in this book will be examples of it."

Did they also substitute for "*baptism*" and "*baptize,*" the words *renewed, sanctified, sealed, enlightened, initiated,* as well as *regenerated?*

*W. Wall.* — "For to *baptize,* they used the following words: — Most commonly, *anagennao,* to regenerate; sometimes, *kainopoieo,* or *anakainiozo,* to renew, frequently, *agiazo,* to sanctify. Sometimes they call it *the seal;* and frequently, *illumination,* as it is also called, Heb. 6:4, and sometimes, *teliosis,* initiation." "St. Augustine, not less than a hundred times, expresses *baptized* by the word *sanctified.*"

We shall now see some of Mr. Wall's witnesses; and I prefer to introduce them from his own writing, as he cannot be assumed to be biased toward the views I have presented in this essay: —

## Justin Martyr

Justin Martyr wrote about forty years after the death of John the Apostle and stands out prominently among the early Fathers. He addressed an apology to Emperor Antoninus Pius. In this apology, he describes the *practices* of the Christians and the reasons behind them. Concerning those who are persuaded and believe the things that are taught, and who promise to live according to them, he writes —

"Then we bring them to a place where there is water, and they are *regenerated* by the same way of *regeneration* by which we were *regenerated:* for they are washed in water (*en to udati*) in the name of God the Father and Lord of all things, and of our Savior Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit; for Christ says, Unless you are regenerated you cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; and everyone knows it is impossible for those who are once generated (or born) to enter again into their mother's womb."

"It was foretold by Isaiah, as I said, by what means those who should repent of their sins might escape them; and was written in these words, 'Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean, put away the evil,' etc."

"And we have been taught by the Apostles this reason for this thing. Because we, being ignorant of our first birth, were generated by necessity (or the course of nature) and have been raised in all customs and behaviors; that we should not continue as children of that necessity and ignorance, but of will (or choice) and knowledge, and should obtain *forgiveness of the sins* in which they have lived, by water (or in water). Then the name of God the Father, etc., is invoked over him who wishes to be *regenerated,* and this washing is called *the enlightening.*"

As you trace the history of infant baptism, Mr. Wall, as closely to the apostolic times as possible, pray, why do you quote Justin Martyr, who never mentions it?

*W. Wall.* — "Because his is the most ancient account of *the way of baptizing,* next to the scripture; and shows the plain and simple manner of administering it. Because it shows that the Christians of those times (many of whom lived in the days of the Apostles) used the word, '*regeneration*' (or '*being born again*') for *baptism;* and that they were taught to do so by the Apostles. And because we see by it that they understood John 3:5 as referring to water baptism; and so did all the writers of these 400 years, **not one man excepted**." — p. 54.

Did any of the ancients use the word *matheteueo* (to disciple) as it is used in the commission; or did they call the baptized *discipled?*

*W. Wall.* — "Justin Martyr, in his second apology to Antoninus, uses it. His words are: — 'Several persons among us, of sixty and seventy years old, of both sexes, *who were discipled* (*matheteuio*) to Christ, in or from their childhood, do continue uncorrupted.'" — p. 54.
So soon as they began to mysticize, they started to teach that immersion *without faith* would obtain remission of sins, and that immersion *without faith* was regeneration. Then came the debates about *original sin:* and as soon as original sin was proven, the necessity of infant immersion for the remission of original sin followed. The importance of baptism for remission was so undisputed that when the Pelagians denied original sin, pressed with the question, "why immerse those who have no sins?" they were forced to invent *actual sins* for infants, such as their crying, fussiness, restlessness, etc., for which they believed infants could properly be immersed, even though they had no original sin.

## Tertullian

Tertullian, the first to mention infant baptism, flourished around A.D. 216. He writes against the practice, and among his most conclusive arguments against infant immersion (for at that time, there was no sprinkling), he assumes, as a fundamental principle not to be questioned, that immersion was for the remission of sins; and this being universally accepted, he argues as follows: —

"Our Lord says, indeed, 'Do not forbid them to come to me;' therefore, let them come when they are grown up — let them come when they understand — when they are instructed where it is that they come. Let them be made Christians when they can know Christ. What need does their *guiltless* age have to rush to *the forgiveness of sins?* People are more cautious with worldly goods; and he who should not have earthly goods entrusted to him, yet shall have heavenly! Let them know how to desire this salvation, so that you may appear to have given to one who asks." p. 74.

## Origen

Origen, though a great visionary, is still a competent witness in any question of fact. And here I would again remind the reader that we summon these ancients as witnesses in a question of *fact,* and not of *opinion.* It is not to tell their own opinions, nor the reasons for them, but to testify what the views of Christians were on this institution in their times. There was no controversy on this subject for more than four hundred years, and therefore we expect only to find incidental references to it; but these are numerous and of the most unquestionable character. Origen, in his homily on Luke, says: —

"Infants are baptized for the forgiveness of their sins. Of what sins? Or when have they sinned? Or how can any reason of the law, in their case, hold good, except according to that sense that we mentioned just now? (that is) none is free from pollution, even if his life is only the length of one day upon the earth."

And in another place he says that —

"The baptism of the church is given for the forgiveness of sins." And again —

"If there were nothing in infants that needed forgiveness and mercy, the grace of baptism would be unnecessary for them."

In another place he says —

"But in the *regeneration,* (or new birth,) by the *laver* (or baptism), everyone who is born again of water and the Spirit is free from pollution: clear (as I may venture to say) as through a glass darkly." — p. 82.

But now let me ask Dr. Wall, — Do Gregory Nazianzen, Basil, Ambrose, Chrysostom, and St. Augustine agree with all their predecessors in those views of regeneration and remission?

*W. Wall.* — "Yes, exactly. I have observed that among the various names the ancients give to *baptism,* they often mean the sacrament of baptism by this phrase, '*the forgiveness of sins.*'" — p. 179. And as for Chrysostom, he explicitly says, "In baptism, or the spiritual circumcision, there is no trouble to be undergone but to throw off the burden of sins and to receive pardon for all past offenses." p. 182. And again; "There is no receiving or having the bequeathed inheritance before one is baptized; and no one can be called *a son* until he is baptized." — p. 183.

The controversies about infant baptism and original sin were contemporaneous; and as soon as they decided the nature and extent of original sin, baptism for the remission of sins was given to infants because of this pollution, and defended because of the necessity of regeneration and forgiveness for salvation; and because immersion was universally accepted as the scriptural regeneration and remission. In this way, there is no reasonable doubt that infant baptism began; and for convenience, as Dr. Wall argues, it was replaced by infant sprinkling.

Unless we were to transcribe all the testimonies of antiquity one by one, no greater assurance can be given that for more than four hundred years after Christ, all writers, orthodox and heterodox, Pelagius and Augustine not excluded, agreed with the preceding views. Were I to summon others — Eusebius, Dupin, Lightfoot, and Hammond, *cum multis aliis* — they would testify the same.

This proposition we will conclude with the testimony of the most renowned of the Bishops of Africa. I extract it from a work now widely read, called the "History of Martyrs." It is from the account Cyprian gives of his conversion. — p. 317.

## Cyprian

"While (he says) I lay in darkness and uncertainty, I thought about what I had heard of a second birth, proposed by divine goodness; but I could not comprehend how a person could receive a new life from being immersed in water, cease to be what he was before, and still remain the same body. How, I asked, can such a change be possible? How can someone who has grown old in a worldly way of living strip himself of his former inclinations and deep-seated habits? Can he, who has spent his whole time in abundance and indulged his appetite without restraint, ever be transformed into an example of frugality and sobriety? Or can someone who has always appeared in splendid clothing stoop to the plain, simple, and unadorned dress of the common people? It is impossible for a person who has held the most honorable positions to ever submit to lead a private and obscure life; or for someone who was never seen in public without a crowd of attendants, and people who sought to make their fortunes by being around him, to ever bear to be alone. This (he continues) was my way of thinking: I thought it was impossible for me to leave my former way of life and the habits I was then engaged in and accustomed to; but no sooner did the life-giving water wash the stains off my soul than my heart received the heavenly light of the Holy Spirit, which transformed me into a new creature; all my difficulties were cleared, my doubts dissolved, and my darkness dispelled. I was then able to do what before seemed impossible; I could see that my former life was earthly and sinful, according to the impurity of my birth; but that my spiritual birth gave me new ideas and inclinations, and directed all my views to God."

Cyprian flourished A.D. 250.

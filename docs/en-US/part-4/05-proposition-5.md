# Proposition 5

***The first disciples were regarded and addressed by the Apostles as "adopted into the family of God."***

This adoption is presented by the Apostle as the primary reason that brought forth the Son of God. "God," he says, "sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, that he might redeem those under the law, so that we might receive the adoption of sons." "And because you *are sons,* he sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying *Abba,* Father."20 "You are, therefore, now sons of God."

Indeed, the same writer, in his letter to the Ephesians, goes even further and describes this adoption of Jews and Gentiles into the status and dignity of the sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty as the main purpose of God's predestination. "Having," he says, "predestined, or beforehand determinately pointed us out, for an *adoption* into the number of children by Jesus Christ, *for himself,* according to the good pleasure of his will."21 Another testimony must suffice on this point. "Beloved," says the Apostle John, "*now* we *are the sons of God;* and what kind of love God has given us, that we should be called *sons of God!*" "If we are sons, then we are heirs of God â€” joint heirs with Christ."

# Proposition 12

***But even the reformed creeds, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Baptist, essentially affirm the same views of immersion, though seemingly hesitant to fully embrace them in faith and practice.***

This proposition will be supported by an excerpt from the creed of each of these denominations.

## Episcopalian

The clergy are instructed, before proceeding to baptize, to make the following prayer.56

"Almighty and everlasting God, who in your great mercy saved Noah and his family in the Ark from perishing by water; and also safely led the children of Israel, your people, through the Red Sea; thereby symbolizing holy baptism; and by the baptism of your well-beloved Son Jesus Christ in the River Jordan, sanctified the element of water in the mystical washing away of sin; we beseech you, for your infinite mercies, that you will mercifully look upon *these* your *servants*; wash *them* and sanctify *them* with the Holy Spirit; that *they*, being delivered from your wrath, may be received into the Ark of Christ's Church; and being steadfast in faith, joyful through hope, and rooted in charity, may so navigate the waves of this troubled world, that finally *they* may arrive at the land of everlasting life; there to reign with you, world without end, through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen.*"

After reading a part of the discourse with Nicodemus, they are instructed to make the following exhortation.57

"Beloved, you hear in this gospel the clear words of our Savior Christ, that unless a person is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. From this, you may perceive the great necessity of this sacrament, where it may be obtained. Likewise, immediately before his ascension into heaven, (as we read in the last chapter of St. Mark's Gospel,) he commanded his disciples, saying, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. This also shows us the great benefit we gain from it. For this reason, St. Peter, the Apostle, when, upon his first preaching of the gospel, many were cut to the heart, and said to him and the rest of the Apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? replied, Repent and be baptized every one of you for the remission of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit: for the promise is to you and your children, and to all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call. And with many other words, he urged them, saying, Save yourselves from this corrupt generation. For, as the same Apostle testifies in another place, even baptism now saves us, (not the removal of dirt from the body, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Do not doubt, therefore, but earnestly believe that he will graciously receive *these* present *persons,* truly repenting and coming to him by faith; that he will grant *them* remission of *their* sins, and bestow upon *them* the Holy Spirit; then he will give *them* the blessings of eternal life, and *make them partakers* of his everlasting kingdom."

This, I need not add, is in accordance with the sentiments expressed in this essay. What a pity that the Episcopal Church does not believe and practice its own creed!

## Presbyterian

The Presbyterian Confession, on Baptism, chap. 28: sec. 1, declares that —

"Baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ, not only for the solemn admission of the person baptized into the visible church; but also to serve as a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, of his being grafted into Christ, of regeneration, of remission of sins, and of his commitment to God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in newness of life: which sacrament is, by Christ's own appointment, to be continued in his church until the end of the world."

"*A sign and seal of remission of sins!!*" This is much closer to the truth than this church seems to realize. However, it cannot believe its own creed; for it does not believe that baptism is a sign and a seal of remission of sins, nor of regeneration in its own understanding, for its baptized or sprinkled infants, but in paying any regard to the Scriptures, it could not say less than it has said. It is no wonder that many sectarians cannot be persuaded to think that the Scriptures mean what they say: for they are so accustomed to saying what they do not mean that they cannot believe God means what he says.

## Methodist

The Methodist Creed says —

"Dearly beloved, since all people are conceived and born in sin, (and that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and those who are in the flesh cannot please God but live in sin, committing many actual transgressions:) and that our Savior Christ says, None shall enter into the Kingdom of God, except he be regenerated and born anew of water and of the Holy Spirit; I urge you to call upon God the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that of his abundant goodness he will grant to *these persons* that which by nature *they* cannot have; that *they* may be baptized with water and the Holy Spirit, and received into Christ's holy church, and made lively *members* of the same."

Then it is ordained that the minister say, or repeat the following prayer: —

"Almighty and immortal God, the aid of all who need, the helper of all who flee to you for support, the life of those who believe, and the resurrection of the dead: We call upon you for *these persons*; that *they*, coming to your holy baptism, may receive remission of *their* sins, by spiritual regeneration. Receive *them*, O Lord, as you have promised by your well-beloved Son, saying, Ask, and you will receive, seek and you will find, knock, and it will be opened to you, so give to us that ask; let us that seek, find; open the gate to us that knock; that *these persons* may enjoy the everlasting blessing of the heavenly washing, and may come to the eternal kingdom which you have promised through Christ our Lord. *Amen.*" — *Dis. p.* 105.

Thus the Methodist Creed and Church are nearly as scriptural as the church from which they originated. She prays for those to be baptized, that in baptism they may receive the remission of sins! Does she believe what she says?

## Baptist

***Chapter* XXX. *Section* 1**.—

"Baptism is an ordinance of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ, to be a sign of the party baptized's fellowship with him in his death and resurrection; of his being grafted into him; of remission of sins, and of his commitment to God, through Jesus Christ, to live and walk in newness of life."

The Baptist follows the Presbyterian church as closely as the Methodist church follows the English hierarchy. But she affirms her belief that immersion is a *sign* of remission. A sign of the past, the present, or the future! A sign accompanying!

## The Confession of Bohemia.

"We believe that whatever is signified and witnessed by baptism in the outward ceremony, all *that* the Lord God performs inwardly. That is, he washes away sin, begets a person again, and bestows salvation upon him; for the granting of these excellent fruits was holy baptism given and granted to the church."

## The Confession of Augsburg.

"Concerning baptism, they teach that it is necessary for salvation, as a ceremony ordained by Christ; also, by baptism, the grace of God is offered."

## The Confession of Saxony.

"I baptize you — that is, I witness that by this dipping your sins are washed away, and that you are now received by the true God."

## The Confession of Wittenberg.

"We believe and confess that baptism is that sea, into the depths of which, as the Prophet says, God casts all our sins."

## The Confession of Helvetia.

"To be baptized in the name of Christ is to be enrolled, entered, and received into the covenant and family, and thus into the inheritance of the sons of God; that is to say, to be called the sons of God, to be cleansed from the filthiness of sins, and to be endowed with the manifold grace of God, to lead a new and innocent life."

## The Confession of Sueveland.

"Regarding baptism, we confess that it is the source of regeneration, washes away sins, and saves us. But all these things we understand as St. Peter interprets them. 1 Peter 3:21."

## Westminster Assembly.

"Before baptism, the minister is to use some words of instruction — showing that it is instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ; that it is a seal of the covenant of grace, of our being grafted into Christ, and of our union with him, of remission of sins, regeneration, and eternal life."

The Roman Catholic and the Greek church say, "We believe in one baptism for the remission of sins."

Calvin makes remission the principal thing in baptism.58

"Baptism," he says, "resembles a legal instrument properly attested, by which he assures us that all our sins are canceled, erased, and obliterated, so that they will never appear in his sight, or come into his remembrance, or be imputed to us. For he commands all who believe to be baptized for the remission of their sins. Therefore, those who have imagined that baptism is nothing more than a mark or sign by which we profess our religion before men, as soldiers wear the insignia of their sovereign as a mark of their profession, have not considered that which is the *principal* thing in baptism; which is that we ought to receive it with this promise — 'He who believes and is baptized will be saved.'"

"The ancient Christian church, from the highest antiquity, after the apostolic times, generally thought that baptism is absolutely necessary for all who would be saved by the grace of Jesus Christ."59

"Most of the ancients concluded that baptism was no less necessary for salvation than faith or repentance itself."60

John Wesley, in his comment on the New Testament, (p. 350,) speaks more clearly than earlier the Methodist Discipline or the Regular Baptist Confession. His words are: —
"Baptism, administered to true penitents, is both a *means* and a *seal* of forgiveness. God did not usually grant this (forgiveness) to anyone in the early church, except through this means."

This is nearly, if not entirely, as much as we have said about the forgiveness of sins through immersion.

Can we not say that we have supported this last statement to the fullest extent of its terms?

With the testimony of John Wesley, the last of the reformers, I conclude my list of human witnesses for the significance of Christian immersion. I could greatly expand this list; indeed, I have been quite disappointed when looking back into creeds, councils, commentators, and reformers, both ancient and modern. I begin to worry that I might be suspected of reaching the conclusions I have presented by consulting human writings, creeds, and reformers. My concern is not that we, who advocate for reformation, may seem to have nothing *original* to contribute to this reformation; that we are merely gleaners in the fields cultivated by other minds. It is not for this reason that we feel anxious, for the reformation we advocate is not defined by new and original ideas or human inventions; but by a return to the original ideas and institutions established in the New Testament. However, we fear that some may suspect the views presented to be a human invention or tradition; because we have found so much support for them in the works of the most ancient and respected Christian writers, as well as in the creeds of ancient and modern reformers. We can assure our readers, however, that we have arrived at these conclusions solely from the straightforward reading and unbiased examination of the New Testament alone. And, we may add, that we are as surprised, as any reader of this essay can be, to find such a multitude of witnesses to the truth and significance of the views presented.

The propositions now proven and illustrated must convince everyone that there is *some connection* between immersion and the forgiveness of sins. What that connection is may be debated by some: but that such a connection exists, none can dispute who acknowledge the New Testament as a divine communication to humanity. With John Wesley, we say it is "to the believing the *means* and *seal* of forgiveness for all previous offenses;" and we not only say we *believe* so, but we preach it as such and practice it as such. Those who consider any other connection would do well to try to clarify what they mean: for we are confident there is no meaning in any other connection. To make it a commemorative sign of past forgiveness is an affront to all rules of interpretation and a complete anomaly in all revelations of God. To make it, prospectively, the sign of future forgiveness is subject to the same objections. Nothing remains but to consider it for what it truly is — the accompanying sign of an accompanying forgiveness; the sign and the seal, or the means and the seal, of forgiveness granted through the water, connected with the blood of Jesus, by divine appointment, and through our faith in it.

We have heard some objections, and we can imagine others that may be raised against *immersion for the forgiveness of sins.* There can be objections made to any person, doctrine, sentiment, or practice, whether natural, moral, political, or religious, that has ever existed. But despite all the objections made to everything, there are thousands of matters and things we hold to be undeniable facts and truths. Among these certain and sure things, unshakable, is the Christian institution.

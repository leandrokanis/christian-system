# Proposition 4

***The early Christians, the apostolic converts, were referred to as "reconciled to God."***

Paul repeatedly states that the disciples were reconciled to God. "When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son."17 To the Corinthians, he says, "God has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ;"18 and to the Colossians, he asserts, "It pleased the Father by him to *reconcile* all things to him, having made peace through the blood of his cross; I mean whether they are things on the earth or things in heaven. Even you who were once alienated in mind and enemies by wicked works, *he has now, indeed, reconciled* in the body of his flesh through death."19 To the Ephesians, he declares that though "once they were without God and without hope in the world, far off, they are now, through the blood of Christ, *brought near.*" He has made the believing Jews and Gentiles one, so that he might, under Christ, *reconcile both in one body to God,* through the cross, having put to death the hostility between both. Indeed, he represents God as in Christ, *reconciling the world to himself;* and so all under Christ are frequently said to be reconciled to God through him; which was the point to be proven.

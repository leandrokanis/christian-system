# Proposition 4

***The early Christians, the apostolic converts, were called "reconciled to God."***

Paul repeatedly states that the disciples were reconciled to God. "While we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son."17 To the Corinthians, he says, "God has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ;"18 and to the Colossians, he declares, "It pleased the Father through him to *reconcile* all things to himself, making peace by the blood of his cross; I mean things on earth and things in heaven. Even you who were once alienated in mind and enemies because of your evil actions, *he has now reconciled* in the body of his flesh through death."19 To the Ephesians, he says that although "once you were without God and without hope in the world, far away, now through the blood of Christ you have been *brought near.*" He has made believing Jews and Gentiles one, so that under Christ, he might *reconcile both groups in one body to God* through the cross, having put to death the hostility between them. Indeed, he portrays God as in Christ, *reconciling the world to himself;* and so all who are in Christ are often said to be reconciled to God through him; which was the point to be demonstrated.

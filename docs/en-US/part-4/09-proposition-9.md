# Proposition 9

***That it is not faith, but an act resulting from faith, which changes our state, we shall now attempt to prove.***

No relationship we have with the material world—no political relationship or relationship to society—can be changed by believing, apart from the actions that belief, or faith, leads us to take. Faith never made an American citizen, though it may have inspired many thousands to migrate to this continent and ultimately become citizens of the United States. Faith never made a man a husband, a father, a son, a brother, a master, or a servant, though it may have been essential to all these relationships as a cause or preparatory principle. Thus, when scripture says that people are justified by faith or receive blessings through faith, it means that faith is the principle of action and, as such, the cause of the actions through which those blessings are enjoyed. But the principle without those actions is nothing; it is only through the actions that faith inspires us to perform that it becomes the means of any blessings for humanity.

Many blessings are metonymically attributed to faith in the sacred writings. We are said to be justified, sanctified, and purified by faith—to walk by faith and to live by faith, etc. However, these statements, as qualified by the Apostles, mean no more than that by believing the truth of God *we have access* to all these blessings. As Paul explains, "By faith *we have access* into the grace in which we stand." He uses these words on two occasions, when discussing the value of this principle in contrast to the principle of law; and in his letter to the Hebrews, when he presents his cloud of witnesses to the excellence of this principle, he shows that *by it* the ancients gained a good reputation—that is, as he explains, by their acts of faith in obedience to God's commands.

That faith by itself neither justifies, sanctifies, nor purifies is acknowledged by those who oppose immersion for the forgiveness of sins. They all include the idea of the *blood of Christ.* Yet they seem not to realize that, in objecting to immersion as necessary for forgiveness in connection with faith, their own arguments prevent them from linking the blood of Christ with faith. If they admit that faith, apart from the blood of Christ, cannot obtain pardon, they concede everything necessary to prove their inconsistency in opposing immersion for the remission of sins; or immersion, as the act by which our state is changed.

The Apostle Peter, when first preaching the gospel to the Jews, taught them that they were not forgiven their sins by faith, but by an act of faith—by a believing immersion into the Lord Jesus. To make this clear, we will examine his Pentecost address and his Pentecost audience.

Peter, now holding the keys of the kingdom of Jesus and speaking under the commission to convert the world, and by the authority of the Lord Jesus—guided, inspired, and accompanied by the Spirit—can be expected to speak the truth, the whole truth, plainly and understandably to his fellow Jews. That day, he declared the gospel facts and proved the resurrection and ascension of Jesus to the conviction of thousands. They believed and repented—believed that Jesus was the Messiah, had died as a sin-offering, was risen from the dead, and crowned Lord of all. Being filled with this faith, they asked Peter and the other Apostles *what they ought to do* to obtain forgiveness. They were informed that although they now believed and repented, they were not pardoned; they must '*reform and be immersed for the remission of sins.*' Immersion for the forgiveness of sins was *the command* given to these believers, to these penitents, in response to their earnest question; and it was delivered by one of the most sincere, candid, and honest speakers ever heard. This act of faith was presented as the act by which a change in their state could be achieved; in other words, by which alone they could be pardoned. Those who 'gladly received this word were immersed that day;' or, in other words, they were converted, regenerated, or obeyed the gospel on the same day. These expressions, in the Apostle's style, when applied to people entering the kingdom, denote the same act, as will be evident from various passages in the writings of Luke and Paul. This testimony, when considering the speaker, the occasion, and the audience, is sufficient to establish the point we are supporting.

The second discourse recorded by Luke from the same Peter, delivered in Solomon's Portico, is equally pointed, clear, and full in support of this position. After he explained the miracles he had performed in the name of the Lord Jesus and stated the same gospel facts, he proclaims the same command—"Reform and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out;" or, "Reform and turn to God, so that your sins may be blotted out; that seasons of refreshment from the presence of the Lord may come, and that he may send Jesus whom the heavens must receive until the completion of all the things which God has foretold," etc. Peter, in substituting different terms in this proclamation for those used on Pentecost, does not preach a *new* gospel, but *the same* gospel in equally strong terms. He uses the same word in the first part of the command that he used on Pentecost. Instead of "*be immersed,*" he says "*be converted,*" or "*turn to God;*" instead of "*for the remission of your sins,*" here it is, "*that your sins may be blotted out;*" and instead of "*you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit,*" here it is, "*that seasons of refreshment from the presence of the Lord may come.*" On Pentecost, it was, 1st. "Reform." 2nd. "Be immersed." 3rd. "For the remission of sins." And 4th. "You shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." In Solomon's Portico, it was, 1st. "Reform." 2nd. "Be converted." 3rd. "That your sins may be blotted out." And 4th. "That seasons of refreshment from the presence of the Lord may come;" that "you may have righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit." So read the different clauses in those two discourses to the Jews, expressing the same acts.

There is yet, in this discourse in the Portico, a very strong expression that declares the same gracious connection between immersion and remission. It is the last statement in the discourse. "To you first, brothers of the Jews, God having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to *bless you,* every one of you, in the act of turning from your iniquities;" or, as we would say, in the act of conversion. Why the Apostle Peter chose to use "converted" or "turning to God" instead of "be immersed" is very clear to the candid and unbiased reader of this narrative. After Pentecost, the disciples who were immersed that day, *having turned to God* through Jesus, were referred to by their fellow Jews as *discipled* or *converted* to Jesus. The unbelieving Jews, soon after Pentecost, recognized that the disciples called the immersed "*converted;*" and since immersion was the act of faith that distinguished Christians from Jews, it was entirely natural to refer to the act of immersion as the conversion of a Jew. The time between these discourses was long enough to introduce and familiarize this terminology in the metropolis; so that when a Christian said, "*Be converted,*" or "*Turn to God,*" every Jew understood that the act of putting on the Messiah was intended. After the immersion of some Gentiles into the faith in the house and neighborhood of Cornelius, it was reported that the Gentiles were converted to God. Thus, the Apostles, as they traveled through the country, brought great joy to the disciples from among the Jews, "telling them of the conversion" or immersion of the Gentiles. Indeed, in a short time, it became a shorthand way of representing the faith, reformation, and immersion of disciples by using one word for all. Thus, "All the inhabitants of Sharon and Lydda turned," or "were converted, to the Lord."

While on the subject of conversion, we will present, as a fourth testimony, the words of the Lord Jesus to Paul when he called him. Paul is introduced by Luke in the Acts, recounting what the Lord said to him when he received his apostleship. "I send you, Paul, by the faith that respects me, to open their eyes; to *turn* or *convert* them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among the saved." Everything to be accomplished among the Gentiles was to be achieved by the faith or truth in Christ. The Savior connected that with opening their eyes; their conversion from the ignorance and tyranny of sin and Satan; their forgiveness of sins; and finally, an inheritance among the saved or sanctified. First, faith or illumination; then, conversion; then, remission of sins; then, the inheritance. All these testimonies agree with each other in preaching the act of faith—Christian immersion, frequently called *conversion,* as that act inseparably connected with the remission of sins; or that change of state, of which we have already spoken.

One reason we want to draw the reader's attention to the substitution of the terms *convert* and *conversion* for *immerse* and *immersion* in the apostolic discourses and in the sacred writings is not so much to prove that the forgiveness of sins, or a change of state, is necessarily connected with the act of faith called "Christian immersion," but to emphasize an important fact: that no person is fully discipled to Christ until he is immersed. It is true that this perspective strongly impacts the question, but it also relates to other significant matters concerning the present and ancient order of things.
Discovering that much depends on having correct views on this point, we have carefully examined all those passages where "conversion," either in the common version, the new version, or the original, occurs; and we have found a consistency in the use of this term, along with its compounds and derivatives, which supports the conclusion that no person was said to be converted until they were immersed; and that all individuals who were immersed were said to be converted. If anyone fell away and was converted again, it was in the sense in which our Lord applied the word to Peter, "When you are *converted,* strengthen your brothers," or as James used it in his letter when he said, "If any of you strays from the truth, and someone converts him, let him know that whoever converts a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins."

The commission for converting the world teaches that immersion is necessary for discipleship; for Jesus said, "Convert the nations, immersing them in the name," etc., and "teaching them to observe," etc. The structure of the sentence clearly indicates that no person can be a disciple, according to the commission, who has not been immersed: *for the active participle in connection with an imperative either declares the manner in which the imperative shall be obeyed or explains the meaning of the command.* I have not found an exception to this: — for example. — "Cleanse the house, sweeping it." "Cleanse the garment, washing it," shows the manner in which the command is to be obeyed or explains its meaning. Thus, "Convert (or disciple) the nations, immersing them, and teaching them to observe," etc. expresses the manner in which the command is to be obeyed.

If the Apostles had only preached and not immersed, they would not have converted the listeners according to the commission; and if they had immersed but not taught them to observe the commands of the Savior, they would have been transgressors. A disciple, then, according to the commission, is someone who has heard the gospel, believed it, and has been immersed. A disciple, indeed, is someone who continues to keep the commandments of Jesus.

# Proposition 3

***The early Christians were addressed by the Apostles as sanctified individuals.***

Paul referred to all the disciples in Rome as saints or sanctified individuals. In his first letter to the Corinthians, he addresses them all as *the sanctified* under Christ Jesus. "To the church of God that is in Corinth, to *the sanctified* under Christ Jesus." Paul argues with the Hebrews that "by the will of God we are sanctified by the offering of Jesus Christ once for all." "For by this one offering he has forever *perfected* (the conscience of) the *sanctified*." It was so common for the Apostles to address their disciples as sanctified individuals that sometimes they are referred to this way in the greetings of their letters. For example, Jude, addressing the entire Christian community, opens his general letter with â€” "To *the sanctified* by God our Father and to those preserved (or saved) by Jesus Christ; to the called." "The sanctifier and the sanctified are all part of one family," says the Apostle to the Gentiles. Therefore, the sanctifier addressed the sanctified as his siblings, and the siblings referred to the disciples as sanctified. But once more we must listen to Paul, who connects his sanctification with the *name* of the Lord Jesus. He says, "But now you are sanctified by *the name* of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."

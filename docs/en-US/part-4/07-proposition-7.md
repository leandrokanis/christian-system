# Proposition 7

***A change of views, while it necessarily comes first, is in no way equivalent to, and should never be confused with, a change of state.***

In all aspects of life, in all conditions of people, we recognize the truth of this; and I wish our readers could see as clearly what is infinitely more important to them: that no change of heart is equivalent to, or can replace, a change of state! A change of heart results from a change of views, and whatever can bring about a change of views may also bring about a change of heart or feelings, but a change of state always requires something more.28

Lavinia was the servant of Palemon and once thought of him as a harsh master. She changed her views of him, and her feelings toward him also changed; however, she remained in the state of a handmaid. Palemon first offered her his heart, and then his hand, and she accepted them. He vowed and she vowed before witnesses, and she became his wife. Only then, and not before, was her state changed. She is no longer a *servant* — she is now a *wife.* A change of views and feelings led to this change in state; but it should be noted that this might not have resulted in a change of state; for Maria, who was another handmaid of Palemon, changed her views of him and her feelings toward him just as much — indeed, more than Lavinia did; yet Maria lived and died as the servant maid of Palemon and Lavinia.

William Agricola and his brother Thomas, both Canadians, were once very opposed to the established government of New England. They both changed their views, and naturally, their feelings changed as well. William became a citizen of Rhode Island; but Thomas, despite his change of heart, lived and died a colonial subject of a British king.

John and James Superbus became great enemies to each other. They remained unreconciled for many years. Eventually, a change of views led to a change of heart: but this change was concealed in their hearts for more than a year and did not manifest in any overt actions. They were not reconciled until mutual concessions were made and pledges of a change of feeling were offered and accepted. From enemies, they became friends.

A thousand analogies could be presented to show that while a change of state often — indeed, generally results from a change of feelings, which in turn comes from a change of views, a change of state does not typically follow and is something quite different from, and cannot be confused with, a change of heart. So in religion, a person may change their views of Jesus, and their heart may change toward him; but unless a change of state occurs, they remain unpardoned, unjustified, unsanctified, unreconciled, unadopted, and lost to all Christian life and joy. For it has been demonstrated that these terms represent states and not feelings, conditions and not character; and that a change of views or heart is not a change of state. To change a state is to enter into a new relationship, and relationship is not sentiment or feeling. Some *act*, then, constitutional, by stipulation proposed, sensible, and manifest, must be performed by one or both parties before such a change can be achieved. Hence, historically, the proclamation of the gospel was always accompanied by some instituted act proposed to those whose views were changed, by which their state was to be changed, and by which they were to stand in a new relationship to Jesus Christ.

This brings us to “*the obedience of faith.*” From the time the proclamation of God's love for humanity was first made, there was an act of obedience proposed in it by which those who believed in the proclamation were put in actual possession of its blessings, and by conforming to this act, a change of state followed.

To understand what this act of faith is, it must be noted that where there is no *command* there can be no *obedience.* These are related terms. A message or proclamation that does not contain a command cannot be obeyed. But the gospel can be obeyed or disobeyed, and therefore it contains a command. To ensure that no one hesitates on such an important matter, we will prove,

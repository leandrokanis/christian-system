# Recapitulation

As Christian faith is based on, and Christian practice comes from, *the testimony of God*, and not from human reasoning; — I will, in this summary, only highlight the evidence for one single proposition, assumed, supported, and illustrated in the preceding pages; that is the *ninth proposition*, as supported by apostolic testimony. We want to emphasize the great importance of Christian baptism, as presented in the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles.

1. **In the Gospels — it is called *the forgiveness of sins*.** Matthew and Mark introduce the Messiah in his own person when giving the commission. Luke does not. Matthew presents Jesus saying, "Go, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things I have commanded you." This, of course, is for salvation. Mark presents him saying, "Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to all creation; whoever believes and is baptized will be saved; but whoever does not believe will be condemned." Luke, however, does not introduce the Lord in his own person when giving the charge; instead, he records it in his own way with the following words: — That "repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem." No one, we assume, will question that Luke records the commission this way; — and if so, then it is clear that since Luke neither mentions faith nor baptism, he substitutes for them the accepted meanings of both, when and where he wrote. Metonymically, he places repentance, or rather *reformation*, for faith; and *forgiveness of sins*, for baptism. In Luke's understanding and time, forgiveness of sins stood for baptism, and reformation for faith — the effect for the means or cause. The only reference to the commission found in John occurs in 20:21. "As the Father has sent me, so I send you: — whoever's sins you forgive are forgiven; and whoever's sins you retain are retained." Here there is neither faith, repentance, nor baptism; but the object, *forgiveness of sins*, is literally presented. In the commission, salvation is linked by the Lord Jesus to faith and baptism in his name. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved. Thus, baptism is taught in the testimonies of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

2. **In the Acts of the Apostles —** In his first sermon, Peter says, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus, for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." In his second sermon, he says, "Repent and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out; that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, and that he may send Jesus," etc. In the same discourse, he says, "God raised up his Son Jesus and sent him to bless you, turning each of you from your wickedness." In his third sermon, recorded in Acts 10:1-48, he says, "All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins *through his name*." Paul, in Antioch of Pisidia, declares that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed; and by him, everyone who believes is justified from everything. Ananias commanded Paul to get up and be baptized, and to wash away his sins, calling on the name of the Lord. Thus, it is discussed in the Acts of the Apostles.

3. **In the Epistles —** The Romans are said to have been baptized into Christ Jesus — into his death; to have been buried with him, and consequently to have risen with him, and to walk in a new life. The Corinthians are said to have been washed, justified, and sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God. The Galatians "were baptized into Christ and have put him on." The Ephesians were united with Christ through baptism, as brides were traditionally washed before their weddings. The assembly of the disciples, called *the congregation of the Lord*, making up the bride of Christ, were said to be *cleansed* by *the washing of water* and *the word*. The Colossians were *buried with Christ, raised with him*, and are said to have been *forgiven all trespasses* when they were raised with him, where their resurrection with Jesus and their forgiveness of all sins are connected. All the saints are said to be saved by baptism, or "the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit." The believing Jews had their hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and their bodies washed with clean water, or water that made them clean. Peter taught all the saints in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia that the water of baptism saved them, just as the flood saved Noah in the ark; and that in baptism a person was cleansed from all their former sins. And John the Apostle represents the saved as having "washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb," and all the baptized little children as "having their sins forgiven." Such are the evidences found in the Epistles. How numerous! How clear! And how unequivocal! Are we not, then, justified in saying, Unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, they cannot enter the Kingdom of God? And that all who, believing, are baptized for the forgiveness of their sins, have the forgiveness of their sins in and through baptism?

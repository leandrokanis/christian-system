# Introduction

Luther said that the doctrine of justification, or forgiveness, was the test of a standing or falling church. If a church is right on this, it cannot be very far wrong on anything else; but if it is wrong here, it’s hard to believe it could be right about anything. I quote from memory, but this was the idea of that great reformer. We agree with him on this as well as on many other sentiments. Emerging from the smoke of the great city of mystical Babylon, he saw as clearly and as far into these matters as anyone could in such a hazy atmosphere. Many of his views only need to be carried out to their logical conclusion, and we would have the ancient gospel as the result.

The doctrine of forgiveness is the doctrine of salvation: to talk about salvation without understanding the forgiveness of sins is to speak without meaning. To give the Jews "a knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins" was the mission of John the Baptist, as the Holy Spirit said. In this way, he prepared a people for the Lord. This doctrine of forgiveness was gradually revealed to the people during the ministries of John and Jesus, but it was not fully developed until Pentecost, when the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven were fully revealed to humanity.

From Abel to the resurrection of Jesus, sinners obtained forgiveness at the altar, through priests and sin offerings; but it was an *imperfect* forgiveness in terms of the conscience. "For the law," says Paul, (more perfect in this respect than the previous system,) "containing only a shadow of the good things to come, and not even the very image of these things, can never, with the same sacrifices that they offer year after year, make those who come to them perfect. If they had been effective, would they not have ceased to be offered? Because the worshippers, once purified, should no longer have a consciousness of sins."

The *good things* to come were future during the reign of Moses and his system. They have arrived; and a clear, full, and perfect forgiveness of sins is the great result of the new system in the consciences of all the citizens of the kingdom of Jesus. The perfection of the conscience of the worshippers of God under Christ is the grand distinguishing feature that sets them apart from those under Moses. They have not only clearer views of God, His love, His character, and of immortality; but they have consciences that the Jewish and Patriarchal ages could not produce.

If faith alone were the means of this superior perfection and enjoyment, and if striking symbols or types were all that were necessary to provide this assurance and experience of pardon, the Jewish people might have been as happy as the Christian people. They had as true testimony, as strong faith, and as striking emblems as we do. Many of them, through faith, gained a high reputation, were approved by God, and admired by people for their remarkable achievements.

The difference lies in the constitution. They lived under a constitution of *law* — we live under a constitution of *grace*. Before the law, their privileges were even more limited. Under the government of the Lord Jesus, there is an institution for the forgiveness of sins, unlike any institution since the world began. It was because of this institution that Christians were so distinctly different at first from the subjects of every previous institution.

Our political happiness in these United States is due to our political institutions. If we are the happiest people in the world politically, it is because we have the best political institutions in the world. The same is true in the Christian institution. If Christians are, and can be, the happiest people who ever lived, it is because they live under the most gracious institution ever given to humanity. The meaning of this institution has been buried under the debris of human traditions for hundreds of years. It was lost in the dark ages and has only recently been rediscovered. Various efforts have been made, and considerable progress has been made; but since the Grand Apostasy was completed, until this present generation, the gospel of Jesus Christ has not been presented to humanity in its original clarity, simplicity, and majesty. A veil in reading the New Institution has been over the hearts of Christians, as Paul declares it was over the hearts of the Jews in reading the Old Institution towards the end of

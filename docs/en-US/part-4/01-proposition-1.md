# Proposition 1

***The Apostles taught their disciples, or converts, that their sins were forgiven, and consistently addressed them as pardoned or justified persons.*** 

John testifies that the youngest disciples were pardoned. "I write to you, little children, because your sins *are forgiven you* on account of his name." He commends the young men strong in the Lord and the old men steadfast in the Lord for their progress; but the *little children,* the youngest converts, he addressed as possessing this blessing as something common to all disciples, "Your sins are forgiven you, *on account of his name.*" 

Paul, in his letter to the Hebrews, asserts that one of the provisions of the New Covenant is *the remission of the sins of all under it.* "*Their sins* and iniquities I will remember no more." From this he argues, as a fundamental principle in the Christian economy, "Now where remission of these is, no more offering for sin is needed." The reason given by the Apostles why *Christians* have no *sin offering* is because they have obtained remission of sins as a standing provision in the New Covenant. 

The same Apostle testifies that the Ephesian disciples had obtained remission. "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as God for Christ's sake *has forgiven you.*" Here, also, in the list of Christian privileges and benefits under Christ, he asserts forgiveness of sins as the common experience of all disciples. "In whom we have redemption through his blood, even *the forgiveness of sins,* according to the riches of his grace." In his letter to the Colossians, he uses the same words — "By whom we have *the forgiveness of sins.*" 

Figurative expressions are used by the same Apostle to express the same forgiveness common to all Christians. "And such (guilty characters) were some of you; but *you are washed;* but *you are sanctified;* but *you are justified* by the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of God." Peter, also, is a witness here. "Since *you have purified your souls* by obeying the truth through the Spirit." 

But there is no need for foreign, remote, or figurative expressions when the Apostles so literally and repeatedly assert it as one of the essentials of being a disciple of Jesus. Had we no other testimony than that found in a single letter to the Colossians, it would be sufficient to support this position. The command given in chapter 3:13 assumes it as a principle. "*As Christ forgave you, so also do you.*" But in the second chapter he makes this an inseparable part of being in Christ. "You are *complete* in him — circumcised — buried with him — raised with him — made alive with him — **having forgiven you all trespasses**." 

These explicit testimonies from the most distinguished witnesses support my first proposition. On this evidence I rely, and I will henceforth speak of it as a truth not to be questioned, namely, that all the disciples of Christ converted in the apostolic age were taught by the Apostles to consider themselves as pardoned persons.

# Proposition 6

***My sixth proposition is that the first Christians were taught by inspired teachers to see themselves as saved individuals.***

Due to some ambiguity in the common understanding of the term *saved* when applied to the disciples of Christ, we will define it as used in this proposition. I do not need to elaborate on the temporal saviors and temporal salvations that are so prominent in sacred history. I do not need to state that Noah and his family were saved from the judgment that fell upon the Old World; the Israelites from the Egyptians and from all their enemies — that Paul's companions were saved from the deep, and God's people throughout history, along with all humanity, from countless dangers to which their persons, families, and property have been exposed: It is not the current salvation of our bodies from the troubles of this life; rather, it is *the salvation of the soul* from the guilt, pollution, and control of sin. "You shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." It is the salvation of the soul in the present life that we are discussing. Here, it should be clearly stated that there is a *present* and a *future* salvation, of which all Christians are to partake. The former is properly *the salvation of the soul*, and the latter is *the salvation of the body*, at the resurrection of the righteous. There are few who profess Christianity, perhaps none, who do not expect a future salvation — the glory of salvation to be revealed in us at the end of time. Peter, who uses this expression at the beginning of his first epistle, invites the saints to look forward to the salvation yet to come, while also reminding them that they have *now* received the salvation of the soul. Indeed, the salvation of the soul is but the *first fruit* of the Spirit, and merely an earnest until the adoption, "the redemption of the body" from the bondage of corruption. It was in this sense that salvation was proclaimed to all who submitted to the Lord Jesus, and thus it is in this context equivalent to a deliverance of the soul from the guilt, pollution, and control of sin. Having defined the present salvation of the soul, I now proceed to prove my sixth proposition, namely, that the first Christians were taught by their inspired teachers to see themselves as *saved individuals*.

Peter, on Pentecost, urged the Jews to *save themselves* from that corrupt generation by repenting and being "baptized for the forgiveness of their sins, in the name of the Lord Jesus." Luke, in recording the success of Peter's efforts, states: "And the Lord added, daily, *the saved* to the church."<sup>22</sup>

Those who obeyed the gospel were recorded by Luke as "*the saved*." The King James translators added the words "*should be*" from their own system. They are not found in any copy of the Greek Scriptures. This is the first use of the term "*the saved*" in the Christian scriptures.

Paul uses the same term in his first letter to the Corinthians, applying it to all the disciples of Jesus. "To those who are perishing, the message of the cross is foolishness; but to us, *the saved*, it is the power of God."<sup>23</sup> In the same letter, he says of the Gospel, "By which *you are saved*, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you."<sup>24</sup> In his second letter, he uses the same terminology, distinguishing the disciples by the same designation: "We are to God the aroma of Christ among *the saved* and among those who are perishing." He tells the Ephesians they *are saved* by grace; and to Titus, he says, "God has *saved* us not because of righteous things we have done, but because of his mercy" — by what means we will soon hear Paul affirm. Promises of salvation for the obedient can be found in almost every public address made by the Apostles and early preachers. For the Savior commanded them to assure humanity that everyone who believed the gospel and was baptized would be saved. And, linking faith with baptism, Peter asserted that baptism *saved* us, purifying the conscience through the resurrection of Jesus.<sup>25</sup>

While Christians are taught to expect and hope for a *future* salvation — a salvation from the power of death and the grave — a salvation to be revealed at the end of time — they receive the first fruit of the Spirit, the salvation of the soul from guilt, pollution, and the control of sin, and come under the dominion of righteousness, peace, and joy. This is what Peter affirms about all the Christians in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia Minor, and Bithynia, to whom he speaks: "Jesus, whom you have not seen, you love; and though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the goal of your faith, *the salvation of your souls*."<sup>26</sup>

These six propositions are each clearly supported by the unequivocal testimony of God, as presented, and, as is well known to the informed disciple, by many more passages that are equally clear and compelling, not presented here; we will now consolidate them into one main proposition, which we will consider in this essay as unquestionable — as irrefutably proven.

*The converts made to Jesus Christ by the Apostles were taught to see themselves as pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved; and were addressed as pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved individuals by all who first preached the Gospel of Christ.*

While this proposition is before us, it may be helpful to note that all these terms express not any quality of mind — not any personal attribute of body, soul, or spirit; but each of them represents, and all of them together represent *a state* or *condition*. But although these terms represent state and not character, there is a relationship between state and character, or an influence that state has on character, which makes the state immensely important from a moral and religious perspective.

Indeed, the strongest arguments that the Apostles use with Christians to encourage them to cultivate and display all the moral and religious excellencies of character are drawn from the meaning and value of the *state* in which they find themselves. Because they are forgiven, they should forgive; because they are justified, they should live righteously; because they are sanctified, they should live holy and blameless lives; because they are reconciled to God, they should pursue peace with all people and act benevolently toward everyone; because they are adopted, they should walk in the dignity and purity of children of God; because they are saved, they should abound in thankfulness, praise, and joy, living soberly, righteously, and godly, looking forward to the blessed hope.

As this essay is intended for readers of average understanding and basic education, I hope I may be allowed to speak even more plainly about the difference between *state* and *character*. Childhood is a state; so is adulthood. Now, a person in the state of childhood may sometimes act like a person in the state of adulthood, and those who have reached adulthood may in character or behavior resemble those in a state of childhood. A person in the state of a son may have the character of a servant; and a person in the state of a servant may have the character of a son. This is not generally expected, though it sometimes occurs. Parents and children, masters and servants, husbands and wives, are terms that denote relationships or states. Acting in accordance with these states or relationships is quite different from merely being in any one of these states. Many people enter into the state of marriage, yet act unworthily of it. This is true of many other states. Enough has been said to distinguish state and character, relationships and moral qualities.

It is hardly necessary to point out that as the disciples of Christ are declared to be in a pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved state, they are the only individuals in such a state; and all others are in an unpardoned, unjustified, unsanctified, unreconciled, unadopted, and lost state.

*When, then, is a change of state effected, and by what means?* This is the significant question we will soon discuss.

We must acknowledge that a change in any one of these states necessarily implies, because it involves, a change in all the others. Everyone who is *pardoned* is justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved, and thus everyone who is *saved* is adopted, reconciled, sanctified, justified, and pardoned.

To illustrate what has already been proven, let us look at some of the changes that occur in society as it currently exists. A woman changes her state. She enters into the state of marriage. As soon as she has committed herself to the loving governance and care of the man who has become her husband, she has not only become a wife but also a daughter, a sister, an aunt, a niece, etc.; and may stand in many other relationships in which she previously did not. All these are connected with her becoming the wife of a person who holds many roles. Similarly, when a person becomes Christ's, he is a son of Abraham, an heir, a brother, or is pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved.

To be *in* Christ, or *under* Christ, then, is to stand in these new relationships to God, angels, and humanity; and to be outside of him, or not under his mediatorship or governance, is to be in, or under Adam. It is to be in what is called "the state of nature," unpardoned, unjustified, unsanctified, unreconciled, and an outsider from the family of God, lost in trespasses and sins.

With these points established, the question arises, *When are people in Christ?* I use this phrase to align with the familiar language of today. No one *in* a house, *in* a ship, *in* a state, *in* a kingdom, is there except they have gone or been brought *into* a house, *into* a ship, *into* a state, *into* a kingdom; so no one is *in* Christ except they have been introduced *into* Christ. The scriptural language is very precise. We find the phrases "*in Christ*" and "*into Christ*" frequently in the Christian Scriptures; but in no instance can one phrase be substituted for the other. Therefore, in all instances where someone is said to be *in Christ*, it refers not to their conversion, regeneration, or putting on Christ, but to a state of rest or privilege that follows conversion, regeneration, or putting on Christ. However, the phrase *into Christ* is always connected with conversion, regeneration, baptism, or putting on Christ, translation into his kingdom, or submission to his governance.<sup>27</sup>
Presuming on the understanding of our readers, enough to believe they recognize that this is not just a verbal critique, but a distinction that identifies one of the foundations of a fallen church, I move on to another preliminary proposition, which I will present in the following words, *namely*:

# 1. Patriarchal Age of the World

The world has its infancy just like humanity. Families came before nations. Family worship was, therefore, the first religious institution.

At the head of this institution naturally stood *the father of every family*. By necessity and choice, he was the prophet, the priest, and the king of his household. As a *prophet*, he taught his household about God and the history of humanity. As a *priest*, he led worship at his family altar, interceded for those under his care, and blessed his children. As a *lawgiver* and *king*, he commanded his children and servants, rewarding them according to their merits. By divine ordinance, the *first fathers of mankind* were thus established as prophets, priests, and kings. Hence, the first religious and political institution is rightly called '*the Patriarchal.*'

Family worship was, then, the *first social worship*; and during the early ages of the world (for at least 2500 years), it was the *only social worship* of divine authority. Although other institutions have since been added, this one has never been replaced. Built on the foundation of marriage, the most ancient of all religious and political institutions, and rooted in nature itself, it can never be superseded. While the forms of this worship have always adapted to the various revelations of God given to humanity, it has persisted through all the changes of six thousand years and will continue until the day when people, like angels of God, shall neither marry nor be given in marriage.

Family worship, as long as it remained the only social worship, underwent no significant change; and this is the period that is properly called *the Patriarchal age of the world*. As long as the descendants of one man and one woman lived under the paternal roof, or until they became heads of families themselves, they remained under this religious and political administration. If, after marriage, they did not move far from the family inheritance, the paternal authority was still recognized and accepted. Thus, over time, he who was initially just the head of a single family, if he lived long enough and his descendants multiplied, became the paternal prince or chief patriarch of a tribe.

In the early days of humanity, families grew quickly; and since the father and head could not always be present while alive, and since he might die before all his children became heads of families, it became necessary to appoint a substitute in his absence and a successor in case of his early death to manage the family's affairs. Nature and reason both pointed to the firstborn son, and religion consecrated him as his representative. Hence, the privileges and honors of the firstborn son were both religious and political; and thus the responsibilities placed upon him entitled him to a double portion of the inheritance. Esau was, therefore, both *prodigal* and *profane* in selling his birthright for a bowl of stew.

The ancient nature of this arrangement is evident from the envy and jealousy of Cain, stirred by the rejection of his offering and the acceptance of Abel's. That jealousy seems to have been ignited by his birthright. This is clearly implied in God's address to Cain when it is accurately translated and understood: "If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it."

The moral and religious institutions of the patriarchal or family worship, which continued from the fall of Adam to the covenant of circumcision, included the Sabbath, the service of the altar, oral instruction, prayer, praise, and blessing. With the addition of circumcision in the family of one patriarch for specific purposes, these were the components of that system which lasted for two thousand five hundred years.

The religious observance of weeks or Sabbaths in commemoration of Creation, and in anticipation of an eternal rest arising from the sacrificial and symbolic institution, was faithfully observed until the giving of the law or the establishment of the Jewish institution. Thus, the law of the Sabbath begins with the words, "*Remember the sabbath*." The righteous always remembered the weeks and regarded the end of the week as holy to the Lord. Therefore, even after the apostasy, which led to the neglect of family worship due to the sons of God intermarrying with the daughters of men, resulting in a flood upon the ungodly world — we find Noah faithfully counting his weeks even while confined in the ark. In the wilderness of Sin, before the giving of the law, we also find the Jews observing the Sabbath. To facilitate its observance, God performed three special miracles during Israel's wanderings. He provided a double portion of manna on the sixth day — none on the seventh — and preserved from decay the portion set aside for the Sabbath.

Sin offerings and thank offerings, on altars made of stone and earth, were presented to the Lord — the former in faith of the promise regarding the crushing of the serpent's head by the offspring of the woman — the latter in grateful acknowledgment of God's goodness in creation and providence. Cain, lacking faith in the promised redemption, like many deists and natural religionists today, acknowledged God's goodness and care with a thank-offering; but Abel, *by faith in that promise*, not only offered his thank-offering but also a lamb as a sin offering. Therefore, while God did not respect Cain's offering without faith in that promise, He testified in favor of Abel's *gifts* — accepting both his sin offering and his thank offering.

In the brief and general outlines of almost two thousand five hundred years provided in the book of Genesis, we find various references to this aspect of the patriarchal institution. Immediately after leaving the ark, we find Noah building an altar on the cleansed earth and offering whole burnt offerings of every clean bird and beast to the Lord. Thus, Noah began to worship the Lord according to the patriarchal institution after the flood. We also see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Job, and other patriarchs presenting their sacrifices to the Lord, while family worship remained the only religious institution in the world.

Even libations, drink offerings, and anointing as tokens of gratitude and consecration are found in this most ancient and revered institution. "Jacob rose up early in the morning, took the stone he had used as a pillow, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it." "And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where God spoke with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it."

A beautiful and instructive example of ancient family worship, and of the priestly functions exercised by the patriarchs in relation to *the altar*, is found in that ancient book, believed by many to have been written by Moses while in Midian; but according to others, by Job himself, who was certainly contemporary with *Eliphaz the Temanite*. Eliphaz was the son of Teman, who was the son of Eliphaz, the first son of Esau, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham. He therefore lived before Moses. Thus, we find him also officiating at the altar. We are told that "his sons went and feasted in each other's houses, each on his day, and sent and invited their sisters to eat and drink with them. And when the days of their feasting were over, Job sent and consecrated them, and rose early in the morning and offered burnt offerings for each of them, for Job said, 'It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.' Thus Job acted continually."

The same Job, by divine appointment, acted as priest or intercessor on behalf of his three friends, princes of Edom: for having spoken wrongly, they were commanded to take seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to Job, the servant of God, and offer them for themselves; and "Job my servant shall pray for you." "Job prayed for them, and the Lord accepted his prayer and forgave Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar." "The Lord also accepted and blessed Job after he had prayed for his friends, and the Lord restored Job's fortunes."

During this period of the world, there was only one high or general priest, specially called and sent by God. "He was King of Salem and Priest of the Most High God." To him, the patriarch Abraham paid tithes or gave a tenth of the spoils taken in war, and Melchizedek blessed him. He was of a unique order. He had no predecessor, successor, or equal in the age of family worship.

From all these facts and documents, we learn that the service of the altar belonged first to the father of the family — next, to his eldest son — that it consisted of presenting sin offerings and thank offerings of various kinds on behalf of himself or his family — that all pious sons and individuals might *for themselves* build altars, offer sacrifices, and pour out libations and thank offerings to the Lord; — that these sacrificial observances were generally, if not always, accompanied by prayer, intercession, and thanksgivings; — and that intercession on behalf of those under the care of any father or patriarch was a part of the first institution.

Benediction was also one of the first duties of this office. Fathers pronounced blessings on their children. Those older and of higher standing blessed their inferiors. Melchizedek blessed Abraham, Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob blessed the twelve patriarchs. The invocation of blessings and the laying on of hands upon the head were parts of the family worship institution.
Concerning prayer and praise, since we cannot imagine a religion without them, it is unnecessary to speak specifically about them as parts of the patriarchal institution. Jubal soon taught people to play the harp and organ, and devotion quickly dedicated them to the praise of God. The melodies of nature soon taught people to tune their voices to God. Isaac went into the fields at evening for private prayer. Abraham interceded for Sodom until he was ashamed to press his requests further; and for Abimelech, king of Egypt, and his family, he made his requests to God. Of him and his patriarchal character, God said, "I know Abraham that he will command his children, and his household after him, and they shall keep the ways of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him."8

Prophets of a public character were occasionally raised up to bring people back to the primitive simplicity of the patriarchal institution, as well as to lead them forward to the future developments of God's purposes regarding this work of redemption. Among these, the most notable were Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. All of these were given new visions of the future, and thus they were all preachers of righteousness and reformers in their respective generations.

From these insights from the book of Genesis, one can learn that the family worship institution, which was divinely established in the first age of the world, included the observance of the Sabbath, the service of the altar, oral instruction, prayer, intercession, thanksgiving, and blessing. It contemplated no other bond of union than the marriage covenant and the relationships that arise from it. Doing justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God were emphasized in all its principles and in the examples of those whom God honored and approved.

During the long period of this family institution, there was no community separated from the world larger than a single household — no public altars — no temples — no established order of public teachers; therefore, there were no initiating or separating institutions. There was no *circumcision* for infants, nor *washing of regeneration* for the instructed. These institutions of later times pertained to public professing communities; and therefore, for two thousand years, there was no initiating rite or ordinance among people.

Wherever the family tents were set up, the devout father built his own altar to the Lord, gathered his own children and servants around him, instructed them in the knowledge of God, the creator and preserver of all; and in the history of humanity, its origin and destiny, as far as revealed to them. They offered their thank offerings, acknowledgments of favors received; and when aware of sin, they presented their sin offering, with confessions, and in faith of God's promise, sought forgiveness. Such are the essential attributes of the patriarchal institution and of family worship, as learned from the writings of Moses.

But since the root of all subsequent dispensations of God's mercy and favor to humanity was planted in the patriarchal institution, it is necessary for our purpose, before we proceed further, to pay some attention to one of the patriarchs, whose fame is eternal, on whom God bestowed an honor above all earthly honor, and who is recorded in the annals of time as **the friend of God**. The intelligent reader needs not to be informed that we now specifically refer to Abraham.

## ***Abraham***

Reader, pay attention! "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations." And shall not the name, the calling, the blessing, and the history of Abraham always occupy a significant place in the records of God's governance of humanity, and in all the details of his redemption?

Because of his unprecedented faith in God's promises and his exalted piety, he was made the *father of all believers*; and his entire life serves as a model for all the children of God, as far as walking by faith in God's promises is an adornment to human character.

Sufficient, then, for our present purpose, we observe that *during the family worship institution*, shortly after the beginning of the third millennium, around the 75th year of his life, God appeared to Abraham while he was still living in Ur of Chaldea, and commanded him to leave that country, promising to do certain things for him. Abraham obeyed. God graciously offered him *two promises*, not only interesting and valuable to Abraham himself but to all of humanity.

These two promises were intended to be the basis of a two-fold relationship to God, and the foundation of two distinct religious institutions, called "the Old Testament and the New," "the Old Covenant and the New," "the Two Covenants," and "the Covenants of Promise." These promises outline the constitution for a temporal and spiritual kingdom of God — a kingdom of God in this world, and a kingdom of God not of this world. Therefore, it should always be remembered, when we attempt to form correct views of the whole economy of God's redemption, that these two promises were made while the patriarchal institution was still in place and several centuries before its conclusion. What, then, it will be asked, are these two promises?

## ***Two Promises?***

We find them in their simplest form at the beginning of the 12th chapter of Genesis.

**The first —** "*I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, and you shall be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you.*"

**The second** — "*In you shall all the families of the earth be blessed.*"

These promises, when fully developed, contained numerous blessings. They are, however, in all their details separate and distinct from each other. Abraham's family alone is personally concerned in the first — all families of the earth in the second. Temporal and earthly are the blessings of the former — spiritual and eternal are the blessings of the latter. Paul calls the second, "The gospel preached to Abraham," and "The covenant confirmed by God regarding the Messiah, four hundred and thirty years before the giving of the law." The Jewish kingdom in all its glory was merely the development of the first — the Christian kingdom in its present and future blessings is the fulfillment of the second.

## ***Covenant of Circumcision***

In pursuit of the first promise, and in order to its exact and literal fulfillment, about twenty-four years after its announcement, the *Covenant of Circumcision* was established. This "covenant in the flesh" marked out and defined the natural descendants of Abraham, and provided the world with clear proof of God's faithfulness, allowing everyone to see how God keeps his covenant of promise with his people. This gave the descendants of Abraham the title of "The Circumcision," and beautifully represented the separation of God's people from the children of this world.

The land of Canaan, as *the inheritance* of this nation, is repeatedly promised to Abraham; and as soon as Isaac, the child of promise, is born and circumcised, the promise of the "**seed**" in which all nations were to be blessed is confined to him. Not in Ishmael, but "in Isaac, shall *your seed* be called."9

After the death of Abraham and towards the end of Isaac's life, his father's God gave him a second version of these two promises. The first is considerably expanded in its details, while the second is repeated almost in the same words. That which was first to be accomplished is first developed, and its provisions pointed out. "I will be with you and will bless you; for to you and to your seed I will give all these countries, and I will fulfill all the oath which I swore to Abraham your father; and will make your seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to your seed all these countries; and in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."10

The same two promises are repeated in almost the same words to Jacob, the son of Isaac, at the time he had the vision of the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, while, in obedience to a command given him by his parents, he was on his way to Padan-aram in search of a wife. On these *three* great occasions — to Abraham — to Isaac — to Jacob — these two promises are solemnly pronounced; always standing in the same order — never confused; but as distinct as earth and heaven — as time and eternity.

Four hundred and thirty years after the first solemn declaration of these promises, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, by virtue of the promise, were redeemed from bondage in Egypt, and saved from the tyranny and cruelty of Pharaoh. Then, in order to the *full completion* of its stipulations, God, through the hand of Moses, proposed a covenant with all Israel at Sinai; in which he guarantees to do all for them contemplated in the promise, confirmed by an oath to Abraham, in being a God to his seed after him.

## ***Sinaitic Covenant***

This Sinaitic covenant constituted them a kingdom of God, a holy nation, a peculiar people. All the blessings included in the first promise to Abraham, or that could arise from the relationship to God which it envisioned, were fully detailed in this transaction and secured to the entire nation. The relationship was, however, temporal, and its blessings were temporal and earthly. The second promise made no part of the Jewish institution or covenant at Sinai, any more than it did of the patriarchal or preceding institution. The typical or figurative part of family worship, expanded and improved, was transformed into the *national* institution and became part of it; and whatever *spiritual* privilege was enjoyed by the Jew was enjoyed on the same principle as the patriarch — by faith in the second promise, and by an intelligent and believing participation in all the appointed means that either prefigured the coming redemption or realized the blessings that were to be derived through the promised seed.
The **seed** through which all the families of the earth would be blessed was in the nation, but only in the sense that it was present in the people while in Egypt, or in the patriarchs before they went down into Egypt. It was in the nation, but not as part of the national institution. They had the second promise made to their ancestors, and all the faithful and approved among them believed that promise and acted accordingly. Thus among the Jews, even before the coming of the Messiah, they were

## ***Two Seeds***

The natural and the spiritual children of Abraham. The entire nation were his literal and natural children; and those among them who believed the second promise and understood it were not only his natural children, but his children in the same way that all *believing Gentiles* are considered children of Abraham by virtue of the second promise. The first group, like Ishmael, were born according to the flesh — the physical descendants of Abraham; the second group, like Isaac, were the children of faith in the promise: and thus Abraham is the father of all who believe in that promise, whether they are his physical descendants or not.

However, the second promise was not fulfilled for nearly one thousand five hundred years after the first, or after the national institution was confirmed at Sinai; and therefore

## ***The Blessings of Abraham***

Which were to come upon the nations through his seed, through faith in the fulfilled promises, was to be the foundation and essence of a new institution. This "blessing of Abraham" includes all the spiritual and eternal blessings that are found in his seed, who is the foundation of this new constitution, in whom all the promises of God are fulfilled, and in whom they are kept for the comfort and salvation of all the faithful children of God. Whatever pertained to the family of Abraham, coming through the first promise, descended upon the family principle which is only *flesh*; but whatever concerns all saints of all nations descends upon the new principle of *faith*. "Those who are of faith," says Paul, "are blessed with believing Abraham." And "If you belong to Christ, then" and only then, "you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise."

The blessing of Abraham was promised in the patriarchal age before the Jewish national institution, and independent of it; therefore that institution cannot affect, much less nullify, the blessings promised in the covenant, confirmed by God, regarding the Messiah, during the time of family worship, and four hundred and thirty years before the Jewish institution began.

In calling Abraham, and in making him the father of many nations, and the keeper of even more precious promises and revelations, God did not replace family worship. He only added to the body of religious knowledge, strengthened faith, and expanded the hopes of that single family. The family institution continued without any significant change, except in one specific aspect mentioned in the covenant of circumcision, concerning the single family of Abraham, for four hundred and thirty years after the charter regarding his seed and that concerning the Messiah were secured to this renowned patriarch. Thus we have traced the continuity of family religion, or patriarchal economy, for two thousand five hundred years, and are now ready to make a few remarks on the Jewish national institution, although we have already covered almost everything necessary for our current purpose. Still, we will make it the subject of a distinct notice. (See Next Essay)

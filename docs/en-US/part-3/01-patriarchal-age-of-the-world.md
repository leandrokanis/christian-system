# 1. Patriarchal Age of the World

The world has an infancy as well as man. Families preceded nations. Family worship was, therefore, the first religious institution.

At the head of this institution naturally stood *the father of every family*. From necessity and choice, he was the prophet, the priest, and the king of his household. As a *prophet*, he instructed his household in the knowledge of God and in the history of man. As a *priest*, he officiated at his family altar, interceded for those under his care, and pronounced blessings on his children. As a *lawgiver* and *king*, he commanded his children and servants and rewarded them according to merit. By a divine ordinance, the *first fathers of humankind* were thus constituted prophets, priests, and kings. Hence, the first religious and political institution is properly called '*the patriarchal.*'

Family worship was, then, the *first social worship*; and during the first ages of the world (for at least 2,500 years) it was the *only social worship* of divine authority. Though other institutions have since been added, this has never been superseded. Having its foundation in the matrimonial compact, the most ancient of all religious and political institutions, and this being founded on nature itself, it can never be superseded. While the forms of this worship have always been adapted to the spirit of the various revelations of God revealed to humankind, it has continued through all the changes of six thousand years, and will continue until the day when people, like angels of God, shall neither marry nor give in marriage.

Family worship, so long as it continued the only social worship, underwent no material change; and this is the period which is properly called *the patriarchal age of the world*. So long as the descendants of one man and one woman continued under the paternal roof, or until they became heads of families themselves, they remained under this religious and political administration. And if, after marriage, they did not migrate a great distance from the ancestral estate, the paternal authority was still acknowledged and accepted. Thus, in the course of time, he who at first was only the head of a single family, if his days were prolonged and his offspring multiplied, became the paternal prince, or chief patriarch of a tribe.

In the world's youth and the freshness of human nature, families soon became large; and since the father and head could not always be present while he lived, and since he might die before all his children could have become heads of families, it became necessary that a substitute in his absence, and a successor in case of premature death, should be appointed to fill his place and administer the affairs of the family. Nature and reason alike pointed to the firstborn son, and religion consecrated him as his deputy. Hence, the privileges and honors of the firstborn son were both religious and political; and thus the duties devolving upon him gave him a right to a double portion of the inheritance. Esau was, therefore, both *prodigal* and *profane* in selling his birthright for a bowl of stew.

The antiquity of this arrangement appears from the envy and jealousy of Cain, roused at the rejection of his offering and the acceptance of Abel's. That jealousy seems to have been kindled into rage because of his birthright. This is fairly implied in God's address to Cain, when that address is fairly translated and understood. "If you do well, will you not have the preeminence; and if you do not do well, sin excludes you (from the preeminence). And (Abel shall be subject to you) to you shall be his desire, and you shall rule over him."2

The moral and religious institutions of the patriarchal or family worship, which continued from the fall of Adam to the covenant of circumcision, were the Sabbath, the service of the altar, oral instruction, prayer, praise, and blessing. With the addition of circumcision in the family of one patriarch, for special purposes these were the elements of that system which continued for 2,500 years.

The religious observance of weeks or Sabbaths in commemoration of Creation, and in anticipation of an eternal rest arising from the sacrificial and typical institution, was religiously observed up to the giving of the law, or the establishment of the Jewish institution. Thus the law of the Sabbath begins with the words, "*Remember the Sabbath*." The righteous always remembered the weeks and regarded the conclusion of the week as holy to the Lord. Hence, even after the apostasy, which resulted in the neglect of family worship because the sons of God intermarried with the daughters of men, and which brought a flood of water upon the ungodly world — we find Noah religiously counting his weeks even while confined in the ark. In the wilderness of Sin, before the giving of the law, we also find the Israelites observing the Sabbath. And to facilitate the observance of it, God performed three special miracles during the wanderings of Israel. He gave a two-days' portion of manna on the sixth day — none on the seventh — and preserved from spoiling that portion laid up for the Sabbath.3

Sin offerings and thank offerings, on altars both of stone and of earth, were presented to the Lord — the former in faith of the promise concerning the bruising of the serpent's head by the offspring of the woman — the latter in grateful acknowledgment of God's goodness in creation and providence. Cain, without faith in the promised redemption, like many deists and advocates of natural religion in our time, acknowledged the goodness and care of God by a thank offering; but Abel, *by faith in that promise*, not only offered his thank offering, but a lamb as a sin offering: therefore, while God did not accept Cain's offering without faith in that promise, he testified in favor of the *gifts* of Abel — he accepted his sin offering and his thank offering.

In the very brief and general outlines of almost 2,500 years given us in the book of Genesis, we find various allusions to this part of the patriarchal institution. Immediately after his exit from the ark, we find Noah building his altar on the cleansed earth, and offering whole burnt offerings of every clean bird and beast to the Lord. Thus Noah began, after the deluge, to worship the Lord according to the patriarchal institution. And thus we find Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Job, and other patriarchs presenting their sacrifices to the Lord, while family worship was the only religious institution in the world.

Even libations, drink offerings, and anointing as tokens of gratitude and consecration are found in this most ancient and venerable institution. "Jacob rose up early in the morning, took the stone which he had put for his pillow, set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it."4 "And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where God had spoken with him, even a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon."5

A beautiful and instructive instance of ancient family worship, and of the priestly functions as exercised by the patriarchs in reference to *the altar*, we have in that most ancient of books, supposed by many to have been written by Moses while in the land of Midian; but according to others, by Job himself, who was certainly contemporary with *Eliphaz the Temanite*. Eliphaz was the son of Teman, who was the son of Eliphaz, who was the first son of Esau, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham. He therefore lived before Moses. Thus we find Job also officiating at the altar. We are told that "his sons went and feasted in each other's houses, every one his day, and sent for and invited their sisters to eat and drink with them. And it was so, that when the days of their feasting had gone about, Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. Thus acted Job continually."6

The same Job, by divine appointment, acted as priest or intercessor on behalf of his three friends, princes of Edom: for having spoken amiss, they were commanded to take seven bulls and seven rams, and go to Job, the servant of God, and to offer them up for themselves; and "Job my servant shall pray for you." "Job prayed for them, and the Lord accepted his prayer, and forgave Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar." "The Lord also accepted and blessed Job after he had prayed for these his friends, and the Lord restored the fortunes of Job."7

During this period of the world, there was only one high or general priest, specifically called and sent by God. "He was King of Salem and Priest of the Most High God." To him the patriarch Abraham paid tithes or gave the tenth of the spoils taken in war, and Melchizedek blessed him. He belonged to an order of his own. He had no predecessor, successor, or equal in the age of family worship.

From all these facts and documents we learn that the service of the altar belonged first to the father of the family — next, to his eldest son — that it consisted in presenting sin offerings and thank offerings of various sorts on behalf of himself or his family — that all pious sons and individuals might *for themselves* erect altars, offer sacrifices, and pour out libations and thank offerings to the Lord; — that these sacrificial observances were generally, if not always, accompanied by prayer, intercession, and thanksgiving; — and that intercession on behalf of those under the care of any father or patriarch was part of the original institution.

Benediction also was one of the first duties of this office. Fathers pronounced blessings on their children. Superiors in age and standing blessed their inferiors. Melchizedek blessed Abraham, Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob blessed the twelve patriarchs. Invoking blessings and placing hands upon the head were parts of the family worship institution.
Concerning prayer and praise, since we cannot imagine a religion without them, it is unnecessary to speak at length about them as parts of the patriarchal institution. Jubal soon taught people to play the harp and organ, and piety soon devoted them to the praise of God. The melodies of nature soon taught people to tune their voices to God. Isaac went into the fields at evening for private prayer. Abraham interceded for Sodom until he was ashamed to press his pleas further; and for Abimelech, king of Egypt, and his household, he made his requests to God. Of him and his patriarchal character God said, "I know Abraham that he will command his children, and his household after him, and they shall keep the ways of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him."8

Prophets of a public character were occasionally raised up to bring people back to the original simplicity of the patriarchal institution, as well as to lead them forward to the future developments of God's purposes in reference to this work of redemption. Among these the most conspicuous were Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. To all of them were given new visions of the future, and thus they were all preachers of righteousness and reformers in their respective generations.

From these gleanings from the book of Genesis, one may learn that the family worship institution, which God established in the earliest age of the world, included the observance of the Sabbath, the service of the altar, oral instruction, prayer, intercession, thanksgiving, and benediction. It recognized no other bond of union than the marriage covenant and the relationships that flow from it. Doing justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God were enforced in all its teachings, and in the examples of those whom God honored and approved.

During the long period of this family institution, there was no community separated from the world larger than a single household — no public altars — no temples — no established order of public teachers; therefore, there were no initiating or separating institutions. There was no *circumcision* for the infant, nor *washing of regeneration* for the instructed. Those later institutions related to publicly professing communities; and therefore, for two thousand years there was no initiating rite or ordinance among men.

Wherever the family curtains were spread and a tent erected, the devout father built his own altar to the Lord, gathered his children and servants around him, instructed them in the knowledge of God the Creator and Sustainer of all, and in the history of humanity, its origin and destiny, as far as revealed to them. They offered their thank-offerings, acknowledgments of favors received; and when conscious of sin, they presented their sin offering with confessions, and in faith of God's promise, pleaded for pardon. Such are the essential attributes of the patriarchal institution and of family worship, as learned from the writings of Moses.

But since the root of all subsequent dispensations of God's mercy and favor to humanity was planted in the patriarchal institution, it is necessary for our plan, before we advance farther, to pay some attention to one of the patriarchs whose fame is eternal, on whom God bestowed an honor above all earthly honor, and who stands enrolled in the annals of time as **the friend of God**. The intelligent reader does not need to be told that we now direct his attention especially to Abraham.

## ***Abraham***

Reader, pay attention! "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations." And should not the name, the calling, the blessing, and the history of Abraham always occupy large space in the records of God's government of humanity, and in all the details of his redemption!

Because of his unprecedented faith in God's promises and exalted piety, he was constituted the *father of all believers*; and his whole life is made a model for all the children of God, so far as walking by faith in God's promises is an ornament to human character.

Sufficient, then, for our present purpose, we observe that *during the family worship institution*, a little after the start of the third millennium, at about the seventy-fifth year of his life, God appeared to Abraham while he still lived in Ur of Chaldea and commanded him to leave that country, and said that he would do certain things for him. Abraham obeyed. God freely offered him *two promises*, not only important and valuable to Abraham himself, but to all humanity.

These two promises were intended to be the basis of a twofold relation to God and the foundation of two distinct religious institutions, called "the Old Testament and the New," "the Old Covenant and the New," "the Two Covenants," and "the Covenants of Promise." Contained in them was the constitutional basis for a temporal and a spiritual kingdom of God — a kingdom of God of this world, and a kingdom of God not of this world. Therefore, always remember, when we attempt to form correct views of the entire plan of God's redemption, that these two promises were made while the patriarchal institution still stood and several centuries before its close. What, then, it will be asked, are these two promises?

## ***Two Promises?***

We find them in their simplest form at the beginning of the 12th chapter of Genesis.

**The first —** "I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you."

**The second** — "All the families of the earth will be blessed through you."

These promises, when fully developed, contained numerous blessings. They are, however, in all their details separate and distinct from one another. Abraham's family alone is personally concerned in the first — all the families of the earth in the second. The blessings of the former are temporal and earthly — those of the latter are spiritual and eternal. Paul calls the second "the gospel preached to Abraham," and "the covenant confirmed by God in reference to the Messiah, four hundred thirty years before the giving of the law." The Jewish kingdom in all its glory was but the development of the first — the Christian kingdom in its present and future blessings is the consummation of the second.

## ***Covenant of Circumcision***

In fulfillment of the first promise, and to ensure its exact and literal accomplishment, about twenty-four years after it was given the "Covenant of Circumcision" was established. This "covenant in the flesh" marked and defined the natural descendants of Abraham, and gave the world clear proof of the faithfulness of God, making it possible for anyone to see how God keeps his covenant of promise with his people. This gave the descendants of Abraham the title of "The Circumcision," and beautifully represented the separation of God's people from the children of this world.

The land of Canaan, as *the inheritance* of this nation, is repeatedly promised to Abraham; and as soon as Isaac, the child of promise, is born and circumcised, the promise of the "**seed**" in which all nations were to be blessed is confined to him. Not in Ishmael, but "in Isaac shall your seed be called."9

After the death of Abraham and toward the close of Isaac's life, the God of his father gave him a second edition of these two promises. The first is considerably amplified in its details, while the second is repeated almost in the same words. That which was first to be accomplished is first developed, and its provisions pointed out. "I will be with you and will bless you; for to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will fulfill the oath I swore to Abraham your father; and I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven, and will give to your offspring all these lands; and in your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed: because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."10

The same two promises are repeated in almost the same words to Jacob, the son of Isaac, at the time he had the vision of the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, while, in obedience to a command given him by his parents, he was on his way to Padan-aram in search of a wife. On these *three* great occasions — to Abraham — to Isaac — to Jacob — these two promises are solemnly pronounced; always standing in the same order — never confounded; but as distinct as earth and heaven — as time and eternity.

Four hundred thirty years after the first solemn declaration of these promises, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, by virtue of the promise, were redeemed out of bondage in Egypt and saved from the tyranny and cruelty of Pharaoh. Then, in order to the *full completion* of its stipulations, God, through Moses, proposed a covenant with all Israel at Sinai, in which he guaranteed to do for them everything contemplated in the promise, confirmed by an oath to Abraham, by being a God to his offspring after him.

## ***Sinaitic Covenant***

This Sinaitic covenant constituted them a kingdom of God, a holy nation, a peculiar people. All the blessings comprehended in the first promise to Abraham, or that could grow out of the relation to God which it contemplated, were set forth in full detail in this transaction and secured to the whole nation. The relation was, however, temporal, and its blessings temporal and earthly. The second promise made no part of the Jewish institution or covenant at Sinai any more than it did of the patriarchal or antecedent institution. The typical or figurative part of family worship, enlarged and improved, was transferred into the *national* institution and made a part of it; and whatever *spiritual* privilege was enjoyed by the Jew was enjoyed on the same principle as with the patriarch — by faith in the second promise and by an intelligent and believing attendance upon all the appointed means which either prefigured the coming redemption or realized the blessings to be derived through the promised seed.
The **seed** in which all the families of the earth were to be blessed was in the nation, but only in the same sense it was in the people while in Egypt, or in the patriarchs before they went down into Egypt. It was in the nation, but not a part of the national institution. They had the second promise given to their fathers, and all the faithful and approved among them believed that promise and acted in accordance with it. Thus amongst the Jews, even before the coming of the Messiah, they were

## ***Two Seeds***

The natural and the spiritual children of Abraham. The whole nation were his literal and natural children; and such of them as believed the second promise and understood it were not only his natural children, but his children in the same sense in which all *believing Gentiles* are by virtue of the second promise constituted the children of Abraham. The first, like Ishmael, were born according to the flesh — the fleshly seed of Abraham; the second, like Isaac, were the children of faith in the promise: and thus Abraham is the appointed father of all who believe that promise, whether of his flesh or not.

But the second promise was not fulfilled for nearly one thousand five hundred years after the first, or after the national institution was confirmed at Sinai; and therefore

## ***The Blessings of Abraham***

Which, as to come on the nations through his seed, through faith in the accomplished promises, was to be the basis and the substance of a new institution. This "blessing of Abraham" includes all the spiritual and eternal blessings that are laid up in his seed, who is the ark of this new constitution, in whom all the promises of God are verified, and in whom they are deposited for the comfort and salvation of all the faithful children of God. Whatever concerned the family of Abraham, coming through the first promise, descended upon the family principle which is only *flesh*; but whatever concerns all saints of all nations descends upon the new principle of *faith*. "They who are of faith," says Paul, "are blessed with believing Abraham." And "If you be Christ's, then" and only then, "are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise."

The blessing of Abraham was then promised in the patriarchal age before the Jewish national institution, and independent of it; therefore that institution cannot affect, much less annul, the blessings God promised in the covenant concerning the Messiah, established during the time of family worship, four hundred and thirty years before the Jewish institution began.

In calling Abraham, in making him the father of many nations, and the depository of still more precious promises and revelations, God did not replace the family worship. He only added to the stock of religious knowledge, strengthened the faith, and enlarged the hopes of that single family. The family institution continued without the slightest change, except in one particular specified in the covenant of circumcision with respect to Abraham's single family, for four hundred and thirty years after the charter concerning his seed and the one concerning the Messiah were secured to this renowned patriarch. Thus we have traced the continuance of the family religion, or patriarchal economy, for two thousand five hundred years, and are now prepared to make a few remarks on the Jewish national institution, though we have already anticipated almost everything necessary to our present purpose. Still, however, we shall make it the object of a distinct notice. (See Next Essay)

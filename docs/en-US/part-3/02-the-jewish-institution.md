# 2. The Jewish Institution

In this age of improvement of divine institutions, we read and hear much about "two dispensations of the covenant of grace," thus making the Jewish and the Christian institutions dispensations of one "covenant of grace." Why not also consider the patriarchal, which is even more venerable for its antiquity and lasted a thousand years longer than the Jewish, as a dispensation of the covenant of grace? Then we would have had *three* dispensations of one covenant. This is merely a "*show* of wisdom." The Holy Spirit refers to them as "two covenants," or "two institutions," and not as two modifications of one covenant; and it speaks of each as established upon promises. The Jewish covenant was established upon temporal and earthly promises, contained in the first promise made to Abraham; but the new covenant, Paul says, "is established upon *better promises,*" which arise from the promise concerning *the blessing of the nations* through the promised seed.

The Jewish institution began and lasted about 1500 years before the Reign of Heaven commenced. It was not a replacement for family worship but an addition to it; however, it did affect the patriarchal institution in some respects, particularly concerning the single family of Abraham. The individual families of the Jewish nation, *as such,* still maintained their family worship — the worship of God was still heard in the homes of the righteous; and, like Joshua, every good Israelite declared, "As for me and my family, we will serve the Lord."

In four hundred years, the family of Abraham had, through Isaac and Jacob, in fulfillment of the first promise, grown into millions. Not less than two million people came out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses. The heavenly Father, in the progressive development of his plan to bless all nations, left the entire world under the family worship institution and established the whole lineage of Abraham that came out of Egypt into one great national institution. He chose to appear as the *King of the Jews* and to make them a *kingdom of God,* as a preparation for the appearance of his *Son,* who is destined to be the King of the whole earth and to have a kingdom that will ultimately embrace all the nations of the world.

The twelve tribes were formed into one great worshiping family, presenting their united worship to God through the common High Priest. This led to the establishment of one public house dedicated to the Lord, serving as the place of gathering in their social and national identity. A constitution, political, moral, and religious, was presented to the people; and upon their acceptance of it, they became the covenanted people of God. This constitutional kingdom was built upon precepts and promises; and its worship, when fully developed, was little more than an extension of family worship to one great national family. They had one king, one high priest, one national altar, one national house of God, one morning and evening service, one great national sacrifice, and one great annual atonement. The nation was a family of families, and whatever pertained to a single family in its worship was extended and adapted to this great confederate family.

Various mystic and significant institutions distinguished this nation from all others; for one principal purpose of its institution was to keep its subjects separate and distinct from all other peoples until the Messiah (the promised seed) should come. Another purpose was to illustrate through appropriate types the spiritual worship of the kingdom of heaven and to present the great doctrines of faith, repentance, forgiveness, adoption, and inheritance through vivid images, cleverly designed to foreshadow the entire doctrine of reconciliation and sanctification to God.

The Jewish institution should not only be viewed in its political, moral, and religious aspects but especially in its figurative and prospective character. God designed it so wisely and benevolently from its origin to its conclusion that its entire history — the fates and fortunes of its subjects from their descent into Egypt, their journey to Canaan, and their settlement in the promised land — their experiences in that land to their final downfall, should exactly and impressively foreshadow the new institution along with the fates and fortunes of the subjects of this new and more glorious order. "All these things happened to them for *types,*" (examples,) says Paul, "and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world have come." The same great commentator on this institution not only presents the history of its subjects as instructive to the citizens of the new institution, but regarding the tabernacle, he says, "It was a figurative representation for the time then present," and its furnishings "the patterns of things in the heavens." "The law," he adds, "contained only a shadow of the good things to come." A shadow, indeed, coming from a man, a house, a tree, is not, and cannot be, an exact image or representation of them; yet, when explained through a verbal description, it greatly aids in forming an easy and accurate understanding of them.

So full of the doctrine of the new institution was the old that we find all the Apostles and Christian writers freely applying everything they quote from the law, the prophets, and the psalms, to the Messiah, his kingdom, and the fortunes of his people; as if the Jewish writings had no other purpose than to reveal the kingdom of heaven. Jesus begins with Abraham seeing his day on Mount Moriah in the typical resurrection of Isaac. Paul views Hagar, Ishmael, Sarah, and Isaac as the best illustration of the *two institutions*; and John concludes with the description of the descent of Jerusalem from heaven.

Therefore, anyone who wishes to accurately understand the Christian institution must approach it through the Mosaic; and anyone who wants to be proficient in the Jewish must make Paul his commentator. While the mere politician, moralist, or religionist contemplates one without the other, though he may find much to admire in both, he will never fully understand either. A veil, as thick as that which concealed the glory of Moses' face from the Israelites, will hide the glory of the Jewish and Christian institutions from his view.

Not only did the tabernacle, the temple, their furnishings, the services of both, the priests, the sacrifices, the festivals, the convocations, and all the ordinances of that Ritual, along with the history of that people, take on a picturesque and figurative character, but almost all the illustrious and highly distinguished figures of that institution were made prophetic or typical of the Messiah or of the significant events of his life, sufferings, and triumphs, and the major affairs of his governance. Among *persons* in the patriarchal and Jewish ages who, in one or more prominent roles or events, or in their general history foreshadowed the Messiah and his reign, the following group stands out: — Adam, Abel, Noah, Melchizedek, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Samson, David, Jonah. Of *things* of this class, as well as persons that are highly figurative and instructive, are the visions of Jacob's ladder — the burning bush — the pillar of cloud and fire — the manna — the rock Horeb, a source of living water in the wilderness — the veil of Moses — the bronze serpent — the victory over the nations of Canaan, and the land of Canaan itself. And of *ordinances,* the Passover, the scapegoat, the red heifer, the year of jubilee, the law of the leper, the kinsman redeemer, the cities of refuge; along with all the sacrifices, washings, anointings, and consecrations of the *holy* nation.

But a third purpose of the Jewish institution, of paramount importance to the world, was to provide a new alphabet and language (the elements of heavenly knowledge), without which it would seem almost, if not entirely, impossible to learn spiritual truths or to make any progress in understanding the relationships that Christianity reveals. The language of the new institution is therefore explained by that of the old. No one can understand the dialect of the kingdom of heaven who has not studied the dialect of the preceding administrations of heaven over the patriarchs and Jews. The most striking and characteristic attribute of the sacred dialect is that its elements are composed of the incidents of history, or what we call *remarkable providences.*

I cannot explain myself better or provide my readers with a more essential service than by illustrating through an actual account of sacred history the following proposition: — *That sacred history or the remarkable instances of God's providence to the Jews and Patriarchs are the foundation of the sacred dialect of the new institution.* Or, if the reader will understand it better, it may be expressed — *All the leading words and phrases of the New Testament are to be explained and understood by the history of the Jewish nation and God's governance of them.* Take the following as a mere example: —

God *called* Abram out of Ur and changed his name to *Abraham*; and the name of his wife Sarai was changed to *Sarah.* He *promised* Isaac as the person in whom his *seed* would be *called.* God did *test* Abraham, commanding him to *offer* Isaac as a burnt offering — Isaac had two sons — Esau the elder and Jacob the younger. Esau *despised* his *birthright* and *sold* it to Jacob. Jacob wrestled with God and *prevailed*; he received a blessing and was therefore called *Israel.* He had *twelve* sons: of these, Joseph was his favorite. His brothers *envied* him and *sold* him for twenty pieces of silver. Joseph *found favor* in the sight of his master. *The Lord was with Joseph.* He was imprisoned, and from there was elevated to the *governor* of Egypt under Pharaoh. A famine in Canaan forced Jacob and his sons to go to Egypt for food, and Joseph was *revealed* to his brothers. Joseph died in Egypt and left his father's house in the land. They multiplied greatly, and the Egyptians severely *afflicted* and *oppressed* the Israelites. *Moses* was born and exposed: Pharaoh's daughter found him and *adopted* him as her son. Moses fled to Midian, married the daughter of the priest or prince of Midian, and tended his father-in-law's flock in the *desert,* and came to Horeb, *the mountain of God.* The Lord appeared to him in *a flame of fire* in a bush. The bush burned and was not consumed. Moses *drew near,* and then for the first time stood on *holy ground.* God *sent* him to Egypt to lead *his* people out of *bondage.*
God made him say to the *children of Israel,* "**I am** has sent me to you. Gather the *elders* of Israel and say to them, *The Lord God* of your fathers, the God of Abraham,' etc. 'has sent me to you. I will *strike* Egypt with my *wonders,* and *bring you out of the afflictions* of Egypt. Tell Pharaoh, Israel is *my son — my firstborn.* Take Aaron with you, and you shall *put words in his mouth*; and I will be *with your mouth* and with his mouth: he shall be to you instead of a mouth, and you shall be to him *instead of God.* Take your *staff* in your hand. The Lord *sent* Aaron to Moses: he met him on the mountain and *kissed* him. And the Lord *visited* his people. And the people *believed when they heard* that the Lord had *looked upon* their affliction. Pharaoh oppressed them even more. The Lord said, with a *strong hand* shall he let them go. I will *redeem* them with an outstretched arm, and with great *judgments.* I will give you Canaan for a *heritage*; I will take you to me *as a people. I will be your God.*

Moses said, I am a man of *uncircumcised lips,* and how shall Pharaoh *listen* to me? I have made you a *god* to Pharaoh, and Aaron *your prophet.* I will multiply my *signs,* and bring out *my people,* and *harden* Pharaoh's heart. When he says, "Show me a miracle," cast your staff before him, and *it shall become* a serpent. Still Pharaoh refused, and *hardened his heart.* The magicians, overwhelmed by the *signs,* said, *This is the finger of God.* The *God of the Hebrews* said, Let *my people go.* I have *raised* you up (like a lion) to show in you my power, and to make *my name known* throughout *all the earth.* The Lord struck down all the *firstborn* of Egypt after he had *plagued* them severely. Pharaoh commanded them to leave; but he pursued them to the Red Sea. Israel was terrified at the sight before and behind them. Moses said, Stand still and see *the salvation of God.* The sea was divided. Covered with a cloud, Israel marched through as on dry ground. The waters stood on either side like a wall. Pharaoh pursued with his chariots and horsemen, but the waters returned, and they were drowned. Thus the Lord *redeemed, saved, delivered, and brought Israel out of bondage.*

After this deliverance, Moses and the children of Israel sang, "The Lord has become *my salvation*; he is *my God.* You have overthrown those who *rose up against you.* You have *led forth your people* whom you *have redeemed.* You *have guided them* in your strength to your *holy habitation.* The inhabitants of Canaan shall be still as a stone until *your people* pass over, O Lord, the people *you have purchased.* You shall plant them on the mountain of *your inheritance*; in the *sanctuary* which *your hands* have *established.*"

They came into *the wilderness of Sin.* They cried for bread, and God *rained bread from heaven upon them,* that he might *test* them whether or not they would *walk in his law,* and they ate manna for forty years until they reached the borders of Canaan.

They complained for water and tested God. And Moses *struck the rock* at Horeb, and water gushed out. But Moses was angry and struck the rock twice, and he and Aaron thus *rebelled* against God and fell in the wilderness. The Lord made a covenant with the whole nation at Sinai and made them a *special treasure* above all people — a *kingdom of priests,* a *holy nation*; and God *spoke* all the words of the law, written on two tablets of stone; and *spoke to Israel from heaven.*

The Lord, through Moses, gave them instructions for building a *tabernacle,* and a pattern for all its furnishings. And as *a ransom for his soul,* every man, rich and poor, was to pay half a shekel as an *offering to the Lord* to *make atonement* for his soul; and it was given for *the service* of the tabernacle. When the tabernacle was erected and completed, *the glory of the Lord* filled the tabernacle and the *cloud* covered it. And when the cloud *was lifted,* they journeyed; but until it was lifted, they did not move. The *cloud* was over the tabernacle by day, and *fire* was on it by night, in the sight of all Israel throughout all their journeys.

And before Moses died, he *laid his hands* on Joshua and gave him a *charge* as the *Lord commanded*; and thus honored him, that the children of Israel might be *obedient* to him as their *savior.* "As I was *with Moses,* so will I be *with you*," says God: "I will not fail you nor *forsake* you."

If we were to continue with the history of this people and add to their history the observance of their religious institutions, we would find the true meaning of the sacred style of the New Testament with more accuracy and certainty than from all the commentators of ancient and modern times. This, as a sample, must suffice for our present purpose.

From the premises now before us, the specifications of the outlines of the Sinaitic and national institution, and the terms and phrases found in the history of this people, we may discover in what *relationship* they stood to God, and what *favors* he bestowed upon them in that relationship.

They were *called* and *chosen,* or the *elect* of God as a nation. As such, they were *delivered, saved, bought,* or *purchased,* and *redeemed.* God is said to have *created, made, formed,* and *begotten* them. As such, he is called their *Father,* their *God,* their *Redeemer,* their *King,* their *Savior,* their *Salvation*; and they are called his *children, sons* and *daughters; born to him,* his *house, people, inheritance, family, servants.*

As a *chartered* and gathered people, they are called *the city, the holy city, the city of the Lord, Jerusalem, Zion, Mount Zion, the city of David.* Other nations in contrast with them are called *not a people, aliens, strangers, enemies, far off, unclean.*

Various similitudes expressive of the close relationship in which they stood to God are also found in the pages of the ancient institutions — such as *husband* and *wife, shepherd* and *flock, vine* and *vineyard, mother* and *children.* They are said to be *written* or *enrolled* in *the book of God*; to be *planted, washed, sanctified, clean, separated to God*; they are called *the house, building, sanctuary, dwelling place* of God; *a kingdom of priests, a holy nation, a special people, saints,* etc.

Those who are curious to trace these phrases descriptive of the relationship and privileges of this ancient kingdom of God would do well (in addition to the passages quoted in their history from Egypt to the Jordan) to examine the following passages: — Exodus 14:30; 15:16; 19:6; Deut. 4:37; 7:6; 10:15; 14:1; 1:31; 7:5; 32:6; 32:18-19; 18:7; 3:18, 20; 12:9. 1 Kings 3:8. Psalm 105:6; 33:13; 105:43; 106:5, 21; 124:2; 149:2. Isa 41:8-9, 43:1, 3, 5, 7; 51:2, 4. Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Psalms of David throughout, etc.

Unless we write a full treatise on these earlier institutions, we cannot properly go into further details. The outlines, as far as they relate to the theme of this essay, are now before the reader; and with this preparation, we shall now invite his attention to **the kingdom of heaven.**

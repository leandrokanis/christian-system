# 3. The Kingdom of Heaven 

And why, an *American* might ask, is it not called the *Republic* of Heaven, and the Chief called the *President* of a Celestial Republic? Certainly, there were the Republics of Greece and Rome before the doctrine of this Kingdom was first proclaimed, and both Gentiles and Jews could have understood the concept of a Republic just as well as that of a Kingdom. It was not, then, because there was no model or type of this sort in society; but because such a type would have been inappropriate to the nature of this institution. 

History shows that Republics are better suited for peace than for war, and that they are forced and unnatural organizations of society. Aristocracies and Republics owe all their appeal to the excessive corruption of the governments under which they have emerged. They are the reaction to force and fraud, cruelty and oppression, and are sustained by the memory and fear of the evils that caused them. They have always been praised or admired either in contrast to the vices and atrocities of corrupt and immoral monarchies, or in the freshness of the memories of the wrongs and outrages that led to their formation; and people have generally grown tired of them when they became corrupt and forgetful of the oppressions and crimes that brought them into existence. Thus, the corruption of monarchies has given rise to Republics, and the corruption of these has led to monarchies once again. 

In these last days of decline, Republics are great blessings to humanity, much like good doctors are blessings in times of plague; but it must be acknowledged that it would be a greater blessing to be without plagues and doctors. While humanity is in such a state of decline, and while selfishness and injustice are so prevalent in society, republican officials are better than kings — because we can remove them more easily. They are indeed kings under another name, with a short-term authority; and our experience clearly shows that in these troubled times, the reigns of our republican kings are nearly long enough. Until the King of kings comes, we Christians should be good republicans, under the belief that human governments seldom improve, and that the popular doctrine of our country is true — that political authority generally makes a person worse, and public favors almost always corrupt the heart. Rapid rotation in office is the practical influence of the republican theory; and the experiment shows that, brief as republican authority is, it is sometimes too long for republican virtue to maintain without deterioration. Now, if this is true of republican virtue, the brightest and best, what earthly virtue can long withstand the contamination of prolonged authority! 

Monarchy is the only form of government that nature recognizes. It was the first, and it will be the last. A government with three or thirty heads is a monster; and therefore the beast that represents it comes out of the sea with multiple horns as well as heads. 

The most accepted theory of human nature and human government now prevalent wherever English is spoken, either in the Old World or in the New, is that a monarchy would always be the best government, because it is the cheapest, the most efficient, and the most dignified; provided only that the crown is placed on the wisest head and the scepter wielded by the purest hands. If we could always ensure this, we would be monarchists; because we cannot, we are all republicans. 

But, after this explanation for the phrase *Kingdom of Heaven,* we would draw the reader's attention to the acknowledgment made by republicans themselves, that a kingdom is better suited to a state of war than a republic; and that this beautiful, though most fitting figure, which appears in the New Testament more than one hundred and fifty times, and very often in the Old, presupposes a state of war existing in the universe. But for the reasons given in favor of a monarchy, the *natural* government of the universe always was, is, and will always be monarchy. God himself is necessarily the absolute monarch of the universe. Had he not essentially maintained that relationship to all his creatures, there could never have been rebellion or sin in his dominion. The systems of nature all follow this model. Every sun is a king over the system it controls; and in every sphere, there is one controlling and supreme principle. It will be the last government; for when the episode in the great drama of *rational* existence caused by sin is completed, the government of the universe will return to its ancient order, and God will be supreme monarch again. But this will not happen until Jesus hands over the kingdom to God, which a supernatural state of affairs placed in his hands. This cannot occur until he has brought humanity back to its rightful allegiance or permanently destroyed every opponent to the absolute monarchy of the Eternal Supreme: "for Jesus must reign until all his enemies are put under his feet." 

The kingdom that Jesus has received from his Father, however heavenly, sublime, and glorious it may be regarded, is only temporary. It had a beginning, and it will have an end; for he must reign only *until* all enemies are put under his feet. But the transition of the scepter into the hands of Emmanuel has not changed the government. He is now the hereditary Monarch of the universe, as well as the rightful King of his own kingdom. He now reigns as absolutely over all principalities, hierarchs, and powers, celestial and terrestrial, as did the great God and Father of the universe before he was given regal authority. 

We have said it was a supernatural state of affairs that originated the kingdom of Jesus; therefore the purpose of this remedial reign is to eliminate that supernatural state of affairs — to put an end to sin. Now, as all human governments presuppose disorder, and as the kingdoms of this world generally have arisen out of confusion and war, the kingdom of heaven we are discussing owes its origin to the celestial and terrestrial rebellions — the revolt of Satan and of Adam. Were there no justice within, or violence without, civil government would be entirely unnecessary, and its components an excrescence upon society. Had there not been such a revolt and rebellion as sacred history records, there would have been no such kingdom of heaven as that over which Jesus the Messiah now presides. Now, as both this King and kingdom, and all that pertains to them, were brought about by such a supernatural state of affairs, we must view them in all their attributes and details, with reference to those circumstances that called them into being. 

***The Elements of a Kingdom*** 

We must understand the type, or we cannot understand the antitype. We must understand what is natural before we can understand what is spiritual. What, then, are the essential elements of a kingdom as existing among people? They are five: King, Constitution, Subjects, Laws, and Territory. Such are the essential parts of every political kingdom, perfect in its kind, currently existing on earth. 

In *forming a state,* the essential elements are people and land. The people create a constitution, and this establishes a President or King, citizens or subjects, and everything else belonging to a state. It is, then, the relationship into which the people enter that makes it a republic, an aristocracy, or a monarchy. Do they choose a monarchy? They first create a constitution, and this places one on the throne — makes them subjects, and then gives them laws. Although the constitution comes first, in the order of nature, among all the elements of a kingdom, for it makes one person a king and the rest subjects; yet we cannot imagine a constitution in relation to a kingdom, without a king and subjects. In discussing them in detail, we cannot speak of any one of them as existing without the others — we must regard them as interdependent, and as coming into existence simultaneously. There is no husband nor wife before marriage, nor can there be a husband without a wife; yet one of the parties must be established before the other. Marriage makes a husband out of a bridegroom, and a wife out of the bride. So the constitution makes the king or the governor; the citizens or subjects, out of the people, as the case may be; for there can never be a king or subject without a constitution, or, what is the same thing, an agreement, verbal or written, for certain privileges stipulated and conditioned. In every well-regulated political kingdom, *in the order of nature,* the elements stand thus: 1. Constitution; 2. King; 3. Subjects; 4. Laws; 5. Territory.  

In the kingdom that God established through Moses, the elements stood in this order. The constitution was first proposed under which God agreed to be their King, and they were to be regarded as his people or subjects; he then gave them laws and established them in the territory previously promised. 

But in the kingdom of nature, or in the original kingdom of God, the elements are only four, and the order in which they stand is: 1. King; 2. Subjects; 3. Laws; 4. Territory. As Father and Creator of the kingdom, God himself was the absolute Sovereign, whose will is the supreme law of the entire realm of nature. 

Having identified the essential elements of a *kingdom,* and marked the order in which they stand, before we specifically address those elements in order, we shall ask, Why is this kingdom called the kingdom of *Heaven?* 

***The Name*** 

Heaven and the Kingdom of Heaven are not one and the same thing. God is not the Kingdom of God. But just as the kingdom of God pertains to God, so the Kingdom of Heaven pertains to heaven, and consequently to God. Whether the phrases "the Kingdom of God" and "the Kingdom of Heaven" always represent the exact same thing, it is certain that both phrases are often applied to the same institution.
This is true of them, whether translated *reign* or *kingdom;* and it is very clear that often the original word *basileia* should preferably be rendered *reign,* since this term better fits all those passages where *coming* or *approaching* is mentioned: for while reigns or administrations approach and recede, kingdoms have attributes and boundaries that are stationary. The reign and Kingdom of God, though sometimes applicable to the same subject, never view it in the same light. They are, in fact, as closely connected as the reign of King William and the kingdom of Great Britain. The former represents the administration of the kingdom, and the latter the state over which this administration extends.

Two good reasons can be offered why Matthew, the oldest Christian writer, generally prefers Kingdom or Reign of *Heaven* to the phrase Kingdom or Reign of *God:* I say *generally,* for he occasionally uses *both* terms. He wrote to Jews in Judea who expected a Messiah, a King, and a Kingdom of God on *earth,* a mere improvement of the Jewish system; and therefore to elevate their understanding, he enjoys calling it the Reign or Kingdom of *Heaven,* in contrast with that earthly Kingdom of God, of which they had been in possession for so long.

He also found a good reason in the idiom of the Jewish prophets for using the word *Heaven* (both in singular and plural form) for *God.* Daniel told the Assyrian king that his kingdom would be secure when he learned that "the *Heavens* do rule;" yet in the preceding verse he says, "Until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of man," — thus using *Heavens* and *the Most High* as synonymous. The Psalmist says, "The wicked set their mouths against the *Heavens.*" The Prodigal confesses that he had "sinned against *Heaven,*" and Jesus himself asked whether the baptism of John was "from *Heaven* or from men." Thus he was authorized by the Jewish use of the word to regard it as equivalent to *God.* If, then, Matthew had meant no more by the phrase "Kingdom of Heaven" and the "Kingdom of God," he was justified by the Jewish use of the word *heaven* to apply it in that sense. Some may object to all these remarks about Matthew's style, that it was Jesus Christ and the preachers he commissioned who called it the Kingdom of Heaven, and not Matthew Levi. To such we reply that the other sacred writers uniformly, in recounting all the same parables and incidents, use the phrase "Kingdom of God," and *never* the phrase "the Kingdom of Heaven."

From the use of the phrase "Kingdom of God," we must, I think, regard him as having special reference to the reason first given. He does not say the Kingdom of *Heaven* shall be taken from the Jews; but "The Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation producing its fruits:" for although it might be appropriately said, in his understanding, that the Jews already had the kingdom of God, it could not be said that they had the kingdom of *Heaven* as proclaimed by Matt. 15:1-39.

When compared with the earthly Kingdom of God among the Jews, it is certainly the Kingdom of *Heaven;* for Jesus claims that his kingdom is not of this world; and Daniel affirmed that in the days of the last worldly empire, the God of heaven would establish a kingdom unlike all others then on earth; in which, as Paul teaches, people are "blessed with every spiritual blessing in heavenly places in Christ;" for he has raised us Jews and Gentiles, and "has seated us together in the heavenly places by Christ Jesus."

There is, in the superior and heavenly privileges and honors bestowed upon the citizens of this kingdom, the best reason why it should have first been presented to the world under this title, rather than any other; and for the same reasons that influenced Matthew to introduce it in Judea under this designation, we should now prefer it, because many of our contemporaries, like the ancient Jews, see as much of heaven and glory in the veiled grace of the Mosaic institution, as in the unveiled grace of the Christian kingdom. The relevance of this title will become even more evident as we explore the constitutional privileges of this kingdom.

But most clearly, the kingdom of heaven is "*the Kingdom of Christ and of God.*" It is the kingdom of God because he established it, provided the constitution and King, and all the materials from which it is built. It is the kingdom of Christ because God the Father gave it to him as his Son, and as the *heir of all things,* and therefore, "all that is the Father's is mine," says Jesus, "and I am his." *God created all things by Jesus Christ and for him.*

Having noted the reasons for the characteristic *titles* of this kingdom, and having already determined what are the elements absolutely essential to a kingdom, distinguished from those merely circumstantial or accidental, we shall now proceed to consider in the order suggested, the Constitution, King, Subjects, Laws, and Territory of the Kingdom of Heaven.

***Constitution***

God himself, after the gracious counsels of his own will, proposed and offered the constitution of this kingdom to his own Son. This "glory he had with the Father before the world was." He who was "in the beginning with God" — "*the wisdom and power of God*" — was set up from everlasting, or before the earth was. "Then was I with God, as one brought up with him; I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him — rejoicing in the habitable parts of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men."

Therefore, he who was to be "*ruler in Israel*" was with God in counsel "in the beginning of all his ways;" for "his goings forth were from of old, even from the day of eternity."

It was **to do the will**, or fulfill the items of this constitution, that "*the* **word** was made flesh and dwelt among us." I came to *do the will* of him that *sent* me, and to finish "the work *given* me to do." "I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it up again; this command I received from my Father." The Father "commissioned and sent him into the world." He "came down from heaven." "You have given me power over all flesh, that I might give eternal life to all that you have given me."

These, and many other passages, which the reader will easily recall, clearly show that an understanding and agreement existed before time began between God and the **Word** of God — or, as now revealed, between the **Father** and the **Son**, regarding the kingdom. As a result, "the *Word* was made flesh and dwelt among us" — as a result, "he divested himself" of his previous glory — "took upon himself the form of a bond-servant" — "was made in the likeness of sinful flesh" — "took part with us in flesh and blood." As a result of this agreement, and the promised glory, for "the joy set before him in the promise," of "seeing his seed the travail of his soul, and being satisfied," he "endured the cross, despising the shame," and was "made perfect through sufferings to lead many sons to glory."

To the stipulations concerning eternal life, proposed in the constitution of the Kingdom of Heaven, frequent references are made in the Apostle's writings. Thus the believers were "elected in *him* before the foundation of the world," and "eternal life was promised before the ages began," "according to the benevolent purposes which *he purposed in himself* for the administration of the fullness of the appointed times, to gather together all under Christ — all in the heavens and all on the earth, under him. He previously marked us out for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to his purpose, who effectively works all things according to the counsel of his will.

From all these sayings and references, we must trace the constitution of this kingdom into eternity — before time began. We must date it from *everlasting,* and resolve it into the absolute gracious will of the eternal God. In reference to all the prospective developments of time, "known to God from the beginning," it proposed to make the **word** flesh, and then to make the Incarnate Word, called Emmanuel, of Jesus Christ, the *King,* to give him all who should be reconciled to God by him for *subjects,* to put under him all the angelic hosts, and constitute him monarch of earth, *lawgiver* to the universe; and thus make him heir and Lord of all things.

As a constitution brings all the elements of a kingdom into a new relationship with one another, it is the measure and guarantee of all the privileges, immunities, and obligations accruing to all the parties in that relationship. It prescribes, arranges, and secures all the privileges, duties, obligations, honors, and benefits of the King and the subjects. Neither of them can claim more than it stipulates and guarantees, and neither of them can rightfully be deprived of any of them.

From the premises now before us, and the light given to us in these scriptures and those in the margin, we learn —

***First.*** That God is the author of the constitution of the Kingdom of Heaven; that he proposed it to the **word** that was made flesh, before the world was, in anticipation of all the developments of creation.

***Second.*** That the **word** accepted it, because the will of God was always his delight; therefore he said, "I come to do your will, O God!" Hence "*God* has so loved the world as to give his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him may not perish, but obtain eternal life."

***Third.*** That as a result, "all *authority* in heaven and earth" was given to Jesus Christ, and all orders of intelligence subjected to him, so that he might be *King* over all, and have the power of giving eternal life to his people.

***Fourth.*** That the earth is now the Lord's, the present temporal territory of his kingdom; that the heathen people are given to him for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession; that all ends of the earth are his, and all dominions, kindreds, tribes, tongues, and people shall yet serve him on earth and glorify him in heaven.
***Fifth.*** That all whom he redeems are his offspring — his subjects: that he will have their faith, confidence, esteem, admiration, and gratitude forever; that he will be worshipped, honored, and revered by them in a world without end: that God, angels, and saints will delight in him forever. He has, therefore, to raise the dead, judge the world, and present the redeemed pure, holy, happy, and triumphant before his Father, and then to give up his kingdom to God.

To fully understand the nature of this kingdom, we must learn more than just its history or the way it was introduced and proclaimed. We must consider all the elements of the kingdom as *constitutional* elements — the King as constitutional King; the subjects, laws, and territory, including the ultimate inheritance, as constitutional subjects, laws, territory, inheritance; and, therefore, we will discuss them in detail.

***The King***

The Lord Jesus Christ is the constitutional monarch of the Kingdom of Heaven. The privileges guaranteed to him regarding the kingdom are as follows:

As King, he is to be the *oracle* of God — to have control over the Holy Spirit — to be Prophet and High Priest of the Temple of God — to have the throne of his Father — to be governor of all nations on earth, and head of all hierarchs and powers in heaven — the supreme Lawgiver, the only Savior — the resurrection and the life, the ultimate and final Judge of all, and the Heir of all things. These honors, privileges, and powers are secured to him by the irrevocable grant of the God and Father of all; therefore, as Isaiah said, "The Lord comes with a strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him. Behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him." "I have set my King upon my holy hill of Zion." "Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for your inheritance, and the ends of the earth for your possession." "I have made him a leader and commander of the people" — "a light to the Gentiles" — "salvation to the ends of the earth" — "a Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek," "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool." "The government shall be upon his shoulders." "All things have been delivered to me by my Father." "He is Lord of the dead and living." "Angels, authorities, and powers are subjected to him." "The Father gave the Spirit without measure to him." "He received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit." "The kingdom is the Lord's, and he is the governor among the nations." "He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth." "They shall fear you as long as sun and moon endure to all generations." "The Father has committed all judgments to the Son."

But, not to tire the reader with quotations and proofs, we will provide just one more: — "Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen one, in whom my soul delights. I have put my Spirit upon him. He shall bring forth judgment unto truth. He shall not fail nor be discouraged until he has set judgment in the earth; and the islands shall wait for his law." — "I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand and keep you, and give you for a *covenant* of the people, for a *light* to the Gentiles — to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and those who sit in darkness out of the prison house."

***The Subjects of the Kingdom***

They are all born again. Their privileges and honors are as follows: —

***First.*** Their constitutional King is the only begotten Son of God; whose titles and honors are — Image of the invisible God — Radiance of the Father's glory — Emmanuel — Upholder of the universe — Prophet of the Prophets — High Priest of the temple of God — King of kings — Lord of lords — the only Sovereign — Commander and Covenant of the people — Captain of Salvation — Counselor, Lawgiver, Redeemer, Deliverer, Mediator, Savior, Advocate, Judge. He is the Sun of Righteousness, Prince of Peace, Lamb of God, Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root and Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star, Light of the World, the Faithful and True Witness, Bishop of Souls, Great Shepherd of the Sheep, Head of the Church, Lord of all, Heir of the Universe, the Resurrection and the Life, the Son of Man, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the end, the Amen, etc. etc. Such is the Christian's King, whose assistance in all these roles, offices, and relationships, as exhibited under all these figures, is guaranteed to him in the Constitution. Indeed, it is all expressed in one promise — "*I will be your God, and you shall be my people.*"

***Second.*** It is guaranteed that "their sins and iniquities will be remembered no more." "There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ." "Sin shall have no dominion, nor lord it over them." The Lord does not impute sin to them. They are all pardoned, justified, and saved from sin.

***Third.*** They are adopted into the family of God; made sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty, children of God, and heirs — joint heirs with Christ. They have an Advocate in heaven, through whom their persons and prayers are accepted.

***Fourth.*** They all know the Lord. "All your children shall be taught by God." The Holy Spirit of God writes the law of God upon their hearts and inscribes it upon their understanding: so that they need not teach every one his fellow citizen to know the Lord, "for they all know him from the least to the greatest." They are sanctified through the truth — separated and consecrated to God.

***Fifth.*** They have the promise of a resurrection from the dead and eternal life; an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading — new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness alone shall dwell forever.

Such are the constitutional rights and privileges of the citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven. All these have obtained for them the following titles and honors: — Kingdom of Heaven; Israel of God; chosen generation; body of Christ; children of God; habitation of God; family of God; Jerusalem from above; Mount Zion; peculiar people; the elect of God; holy nation; temple of the Holy Spirit; house of God; city of the living God; pillar and ground of the truth; living stones; seed of Abraham; citizens of heaven; lights of the world; salt of the earth; heirs of God; joint heirs with Christ, etc.

The privileges, honors, and benefits belong to every citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven. Indeed, they are all summarized in the statement that Paul (from Jeremiah) presents to the believing Hebrews: — "This is the constitution that I will make with the house of Israel in those days: I will put my laws into their minds, and inscribe them upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall not teach every man his fellow citizen, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them; because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more." To this summary, the reader may add those scriptures in the margin, as confirmation of the above.

***The Laws of the Kingdom***

The supreme law of the kingdom is *love* — love for the King and love for each other. From this law all its religious homage and morality flow. Numerous precepts and examples present this to the minds of all the citizens. The Kingdom of Heaven is divided into small societies, called *churches,* or *congregations of the Lord.* Each of these communities, in the reception of members, in their education and discipline, or in excluding them when necessary, is to be governed by the apostolic instructions: for to the Apostles, the Savior committed the management of his kingdom. After they had made citizens by preaching the gospel and baptizing, they were commanded to teach them to observe whatever the Savior had commanded them.

These laws and practices of the Apostles must be learned from what the Apostles published to the world after the ascension and coronation of the King, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles: for we will see later that the gospel was fully developed, and the whole doctrine of the Reign of Christ *began* to be proclaimed in Jerusalem on the first Pentecost after the ascension.

The old or Jewish constitution was proclaimed first on Sinai on the first Pentecost after the redemption of Israel from Egyptian bondage; and from that day, and what is written after it in Exodus and Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, all the laws, customs, and practices authorized by the national constitution are to be found. They are not to be sought after in Genesis, nor in the earlier economy. Neither are the statutes and laws of the Christian kingdom to be sought in the Jewish scriptures, nor prior to the day of Pentecost; except to the extent that our Lord himself, during his lifetime, presented the doctrine of his reign. But we will clarify the *beginning* of this kingdom.

There is one universal law of naturalization, or for making citizens out of all nations, mandated upon those citizens of the kingdom who are engaged in the work of proselytism; but the laws of this kingdom, like the laws of every other kingdom, are obligatory only on the citizens.

The weekly celebration of the death and resurrection of Jesus, and the weekly meeting of the disciples of Christ for this purpose, and for the edification of one another in their most holy faith, are the only positive statutes of the kingdom; and, therefore, there is no law, statute, or observance in this kingdom that in the least hinders its extension from East to West, from North to South, or that can prevent its progress in all nations of the world.

It is, however, worth noting that every part of Christian worship, in the small communities spread over the territory of the Kingdom of Heaven, like so many candlesticks in a large building, is designed to enlighten and convert the world; and, therefore, in all the meetings of the family of God, they are to keep this supremely in view; and to regard themselves as the "pillar and ground of the truth."
Concerning the details of the laws of the kingdom, we cannot speak specifically at this time. "The grace of God that brings salvation teaches all the citizens of heaven that, denying all ungodliness and worldly desires, they should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, expecting the blessed hope — namely, the appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all wrongdoing and purify for himself a special people, eager to do good works." These things the Bishops of every community should teach and enforce; for such is the spirit, and such is the purpose of all the laws and statutes of the Kingdom of Heaven.

***The Territory of the Kingdom***

In all other kingdoms, except the Kingdom of Heaven, the territory is the national domain and inheritance. It was so in the first Kingdom of God under the constitution from Sinai. But in the typical kingdom, they lived at a distance from their inheritance for one generation. During these forty years, in which they pitched their tents in the wilderness, *God was their inheritance.* He rained bread from heaven upon them and sent them meat upon the east wind. He made the flinty rock Horeb a living spring, whose stream followed them all the way to Jordan. He renewed their garments every day, so that for forty years they did not wear out and did not need a single patch. A pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day guided them toward Canaan, the land of their inheritance.

The whole earth is the present territory of the Kingdom of Heaven, but the new heavens and earth are to be its *inheritance.* The earth, indeed, is the Lord's, and everything in it; but the children of God and the children of the wicked one — the *wheat* and the *tares,* are both planted in it and must grow until the harvest. The righteous have their bread and water guaranteed to them while they live; for "godliness is profitable for all things, having *promise of the life that now is,* as well as of that which is to come." But the joint heirs of Christ are never taught to regard the earth as their inheritance. They may indeed say, though poor and penniless, "All things are ours; whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come — all are ours, and we are Christ's, and Christ is God's." But, like the Jews on their journey to Canaan, "they seek a better country" — "they seek a city yet to come." "My kingdom," says Jesus, "is not of this world." And therefore, in the world, Christians are strangers and pilgrims and may expect tribulation.

The earth is the present *theater of war;* therefore all Christians in the territory are *soldiers.* Their expenses and rations are provided, and the arms and munitions of war are supplied to them from the stores in Mount Zion, the stronghold and fortress of the kingdom; where the King, the heads of departments, and all the legions of angels reside. So that upon entering the Army of Faith, every soldier is equipped with the armor of God; and when inducted into the heavenly tactics under the Captain of Salvation, he is expected to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ and to fight the good fight of faith courageously and victoriously.

The Kingdom of Heaven in this territory is greatly opposed by the kingdom of Satan, which always seeks to make an *inheritance* out of the territory of the militant kingdom of righteousness; and therefore, the citizens do not wrestle with flesh and blood, but with the rulers of the darkness of this world — with spiritual wickedness in high places.

Ever since the beginning of this kingdom, the governments of this world have either been directly opposed to it or, at best, pretended to be friends; and therefore their influence has always been contrary to the true spirit and essence of the Christian institution. Christians have nothing to expect from them except liberty of conscience and protection from violence while leading peaceful and quiet lives, in all godliness and honesty, until Jesus takes to himself his great power, hurls all these rulers from their thrones, and makes his cause triumphant — a consummation devoutly to be wished, and which cannot now be regarded as far off.

***Manner and Customs of the Kingdom***

Regarding *the manners and customs* of the Kingdom of Heaven, they are similar to those generally practiced in the land of Judea and in the East at the time of its establishment: or, rather, they are the simple manners and customs of the *family worship age* of the world. These are sanctified by simply performing them with regard to Jesus Christ or from the motives prompted by the doctrine of the Reign of Heaven. As we treat our natural brothers and sisters in public and in private — as we address, greet, and converse with them — as we handle all family business and conduct the affairs of the household — so are Christians to treat one another. There is no other virtue or utility in these actions than as they foster brotherly kindness and love and are directed toward the Lord.

***Induction into the Kingdom of Heaven***

In every kingdom, human or divine, there is a legal door of admission. That is, in the statute book of Heaven, called a *birth.* Into the kingdom of nature, we are born. Into the future and ultimate kingdom of glory, we enter, soul and body, by being born from the grave. As Christ, the firstborn from the dead, entered the heavenly kingdom, so must all his brethren. And as for this kingdom of which we speak, as it now exists in this world, Jesus himself taught that no one can legally enter it who is not born again, or "*born of water and the Spirit.*" The analogy is complete between the kingdoms of nature — of grace — and of glory. Hence we have natural birth, metaphorical or spiritual birth, and supernatural birth. There is being born of the flesh — born of the Spirit — born of the grave; and there is a kingdom for the flesh — a kingdom for the Spirit — and a kingdom for the glorified person.

This second, or new birth, which inducts into the Kingdom of God, always follows a death and burial, as it will into the everlasting kingdom of glory. It is indeed a literal death and burial before a literal resurrection into the heavenly and eternal kingdom. It is also a metaphorical or figurative death and burial before the figurative resurrection or new birth into the Kingdom of Heaven. Water is the element in which this burial and resurrection are performed, according to the constitutional laws of the Kingdom of Heaven. Hence Jesus connects the water and the Spirit when speaking of entering the Kingdom of God.

In naturalizing aliens, the command of the King is first — submit to them the Constitution, or preach to them *the gospel of the kingdom.* As soon as they understand and believe this and desire to be translated into the Kingdom of Christ and of God, that "they may receive the remission of sins and inheritance among all who are sanctified," they are to be buried in water in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and raised out of it confessing their death to sin, their faith in Christ's sacrifice and resurrection: and thus they are born of water and the Spirit and made citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven. *To as many as thus receive him, he gives the privilege to become the children of God;* for they are "*born of God*" — born of *God,* when born of water and the Spirit, because this is the institution of God.

In these days of apostasy, people have sought out many inventions. Some have attempted to enter the Kingdom of Heaven without being born at all. Others imagine that they can be born of the Spirit without water and that the King is pleased with those who have been born without a mother, as with those who are lawfully born of father and mother. Others think that neither Spirit nor water is necessary; but if they are politically born of the flesh, they can enter the kingdom as rightfully as the Jewish circumcised infants enter the earthly kingdom of Israel. But since we have no faith in any modern improvements of the gospel, changes, or amendments to the constitution of the Kingdom of Heaven, we must leave them to account to the King himself, who "*have transgressed the law, changed the ordinance, and broken the everlasting covenant;*" and proceed to the question, “When did the Kingdom of Heaven begin?” (See next essay)

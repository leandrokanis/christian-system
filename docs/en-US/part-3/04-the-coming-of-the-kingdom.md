# 4. The Coming of the Kingdom

When did the Kingdom of Heaven begin? "With the ministry of John," says one: "With the ministry of Jesus," says another: "With the first sending out of the Twelve Apostles," says a third: "At the resurrection of Jesus," says a fourth: "At none of them; but gradually from the baptism of John until the fall of Jerusalem," says a fifth.

The reader should remember that there are at least *five elements* essential to a perfectly organized kingdom, and that it can be considered in relation to one or more of these components. Hence the numerous and varied parables of the Savior. Sometimes he speaks of the administration of its affairs — of its principles in the heart — of its subjects — of its King — of its territory — of its progress — of various incidents in its history. Thus, the parable of the sower — of wheat and tares — of the leaven — of the merchant seeking fine pearls — of the grain of mustard seed — of the dragnet — of the marriage of a king's son — of a nobleman going into a far country — of the ten virgins — of the talents — of the sheep and goats present to our view the Kingdom of Heaven in different aspects, either in its elements or in its history — its beginning or its end.

The coming of the Kingdom of Heaven can properly refer only to one or two of the elements of a kingdom; or to the formal presentation of that entire organization of society which we call *a kingdom.* It cannot properly refer to its territory; for that was created and established before man was created. It cannot refer to the individuals who were made subjects, for they too existed before the kingdom began. It cannot refer to the birth or baptism of the King, for it was not until after these that Jesus *began* to proclaim its coming or approach. It cannot refer to the ministry of John or of Jesus, any more than to the patriarchal or Jewish dispensations; because Jesus did not begin to proclaim the coming of this reign *until after John was imprisoned.* This is a fact of such significance that Matthew, Mark, and Luke clearly state that, in accordance with ancient prophecies, Jesus was to begin to proclaim in *Galilee,* and *that he did not start to proclaim the doctrine or the gospel of the coming of the Reign until after John's ministry ended and he was imprisoned.* In this assertion, the Evangelists agree: "Now Jesus, hearing that John was imprisoned, withdrew into Galilee; and having left Nazareth, he settled in Capernaum. For thus says the Prophet," etc. From that time, Jesus *began* to proclaim, saying, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near;" or, "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand," as the common version states.

Some Baptists, for the sake of *immersion,* and some of our brethren in the Reformation, for the sake of *immersion for the remission of sins,* seem eager to place John in the Kingdom of Heaven and to date the beginning of the Christian dispensation with the first appearance of John the Baptist. They argue in support of this hypothesis that Jesus said, "The Law and the Prophets were until John," (the only instructors of men); "since that time the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is pressing into it." "Tax collectors and sinners show you the way into the Kingdom of Heaven," Jesus said to the Pharisees. Again, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees! For you shut the Kingdom of Heaven against men, and will neither enter yourselves, nor allow others who would to enter." "The Kingdom of God is within you." "The Kingdom of Heaven has come upon you." From these premises, they conclude that the Kingdom of Heaven was actually established by John the Baptist: "For," they say, "how could men and women *enter into a kingdom* that was not established? And did not John immerse for the remission of sins, and call upon people to repent and reform in order to baptism?"

The Paidobaptists, too, want Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, David, and all the circumcised Jews in the Kingdom of Heaven, because Jesus said, "Before Abraham was, I am;" "Abraham saw my day and was glad;" and Paul says Moses considered the reproach of Christ greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt, and forsook Egypt in faith of the Christian reward. Yes, and Paul affirms that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their families, who lived in tents in the promised land, looked not only to the rest in Canaan, but they sought a heavenly country, and expected the city with foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Thus, the Jews had Christ in the manna and in the rock, and baptism in the cloud and in the sea.

The mistake is fundamentally the same. Christ was promised and foreshadowed before he came, and the Kingdom of Heaven was promised and preached by John, by Jesus, the Twelve, and the Seventy, (who went about proclaiming the good news of the Reign), before the Reign of Christ, or Kingdom of Heaven began. Because Christ was promised and foreshadowed in the patriarchal and Jewish ages, the Paidobaptists will assert that the Kingdom of Heaven has existed on earth since the days of Abel; and because the good news of the Reign and Kingdom of Heaven and the principles of the new and heavenly order of society were proclaimed by John, the Baptists will insist that John the Baptist was in the Kingdom of Heaven, and the very one who established it.

Let us, then, examine this matter with complete honesty: and first, we will place the passages quoted from the testimonies of the Evangelists on one side, and the following passages on the other side; and then see if we can reconcile them. John says, "Repent, for the Kingdom of God is near." Jesus began to proclaim, saying, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." He also commanded the Twelve and the Seventy to travel throughout Judea, making the same proclamation. Of John the Baptist, he said, though greater than all the Prophets, "The least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he."

Thus, after John was beheaded, we have about eighty-four preachers daily proclaiming the imminent approach of the Kingdom of God; and Jesus often assuring his disciples that the Kingdom of God was soon to appear, and that some of his companions would see him enter upon his Reign before they died — and yet the Kingdom was established by John! Scribes and Pharisees were shutting the kingdom against men, when Jesus had only given the keys to Peter! John the Baptist was in the kingdom, and the least in the kingdom is greater than he! More than eighty preachers say, "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand;" and John the Baptist, before he died, introduced all Judea and Jerusalem into it! How, then, shall we reconcile these apparent contradictions? Make both sides figurative, and it may be done. Regard both sides literally, and it cannot be done! To say that the kingdom came in one sense at one time, and in another sense at another time, is simply to say that it came in different meanings — literally and figuratively. For our part, we must believe that the Kingdom of Heaven began, or the Reign of Heaven literally and truly commenced in one day.

Many of its principles were developed by the ancient Prophets; David, Isaiah, and others wrote extensively about it; John the Baptist proclaimed its immediate and near approach, and more fully developed its spiritual purpose; therefore he was superior to them. Jesus often revealed its character and purpose in various parables; and everyone who understood and accepted these *principles* was said to "press into the kingdom," or to have "the kingdom within them;" and wherever these principles were proclaimed, "the Kingdom of Heaven" was said to "come near" to the people, or to have "overtaken them;" and those who opposed these principles and used their authority to prevent others from receiving them were said to "shut the Kingdom of Heaven against men;" and thus all these scriptures must necessarily be understood in the contexts in which they appear: for it is impossible that the Reign of Heaven could literally commence "*until Jesus was glorified,*" "received the promise of the Holy Spirit," was "made Lord and Christ," and "sat down with his Father upon the throne" — for he left the earth *to receive a kingdom.*

To make this, if possible, even more evident, we ask *When did the Kingdom of God, established by Moses among the descendants of Abraham, cease?* This question penetrates the whole nature and necessity of the case: for will anyone suppose that there were two Kingdoms of God on earth at the same time? Certainly one must have ceased before the other began.

Now, that the kingdom of God, administered by Moses, had not ceased during the personal ministry of the Messiah on earth, is, we think, abundantly evident from the following facts and documents:

***First.*** Jesus was to have appeared, and did appear, "*in the end of the world,*" or last days of the first Kingdom of God. "In the conclusion of the age has he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself." The "world to come" was one of the names of the gospel age. He has not subjected "the world to come" to angels, as he did the past world, says Paul to the Hebrews. He appeared, then, not in the beginning of the gospel age, but in the end of the Jewish age.

***Second.*** The Temple was the house of God until the very end of Jesus' life. For it was not until the Jewish leaders conspired to kill him that he abandoned it. At the last festival of his life, and immediately before he fell into their hands, upon leaving the Temple, he said, "Behold, your house is deserted, for you shall not see me henceforth until you say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" It was his Father's house, the house of God, until that moment. Then, indeed, the glory departed.

***Third.*** The Jewish offerings and service, as a divine institution, continued until the condemnation of Jesus. He sent the cleansed leper to the priest to make the offering commanded in the law. He commanded the people to listen to the teachers of the law who sat in Moses' seat. He paid the temple tax. He was a minister of the circumcision. He lived *under,* not *after* the law. He kept all its ordinances, and caused all his disciples to regard it in its original meaning and authority until the last Passover. *Indeed, it could not be disannulled, for it was not completed until on the cross he said,* "**it is finished**."
***Fourth.*** When he visited Jerusalem for the last time, and in the final parable he shared with them, he told them clearly that "the Kingdom of God would be taken from them" and given to a nation that would make better use of the honors of the kingdom; consequently, at that time, the Jews had the Kingdom of God.

***Fifth.*** It was not until his death that the veil of the Temple was torn; that the things "which could be shaken were shaken." It was then, and not until then, that he nailed the legal institution to the cross. Then, and not until then, was the middle wall of partition broken down. The last Sabbath he rested in the grave. *From the moment of his death, there was no life in the old Kingdom of God.* The Temple was deserted, its veil torn, its foundation shaken, the city devoted, the ritual abolished, and as after death comes judgment — the Temple, city, and nation waited for the day of his vengeance.

The Kingdom of God was clearly present in the Jewish institution until Jesus died. Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven did not come while Jesus lived. In anticipation, those who believed the gospel of the kingdom received the Kingdom of God, just as in anticipation he said, "I have finished the work which you gave me to do" before he began to suffer; and as he said, "This cup is the new testament in my blood, shed for the remission of the sins of many," before it was shed. So while the doctrines of this reign — faith, repentance, baptism, and a new principle of sonship to Abraham were being proclaimed by John, the Twelve, the Seventy, and by Himself, the Kingdom of Heaven was approaching; and those who embraced these principles by anticipation were said to enter into the kingdom, or to have the kingdom within them.

The principles of any reign or revolution are always proclaimed, debated, and discussed before a new order of things is established. A party is formed around these principles before strength is acquired, or a leader is found capable of starting a new order of things. In society, as in nature, we first have the blade, then the stem, and finally the ripe grain in the ear. We call it wheat, or we call it corn, when we only have the promise in the blade. By such a figure of speech, the Kingdom of God was spoken of while only its principles were being proclaimed.

When these American states were colonial subjects of the king of England, and long before the establishment of a republic, republican doctrines were proclaimed and debated. The believers and advocates of these doctrines were called republicans, even though there was not yet a republic on this continent. He who dates the beginning of the Kingdom of Heaven from the ministry of John the Baptist aligns with those who date the American republics from the first proclamation of republican principles, or from the formation of a republican party in the British colonies. But just as a faithful and knowledgeable historian, in writing the history of the American republics, starts with the history of the first proclamation of these principles and records the sayings and deeds of the first proponents of the new doctrines; so the sacred historians began their history of the Kingdom of Heaven with the appearance of John in the wilderness of Judea, preaching the Messiah, faith, repentance, a holy life, and *raising up a new generation of Israelites based on faith rather than lineage;* for this was truly the "blade" of the Kingdom of Heaven.

Having considered all these points, we see that until the death of the Messiah, his kingdom *could not* begin; and we see from the record itself that it *did not* begin before his resurrection. We now proceed to the development of events after his resurrection to determine the day on which this kingdom was established, or when the Reign of Heaven began.

The writer to whom we owe the most for an orderly and continuous narrative of the affairs of the Kingdom of Heaven is the Evangelist Luke. His history begins with the angelic announcements of the births of John and Jesus, and ends with the appearance of the great standard-bearer of the Cross in Imperial Rome, A.D. 64. The part of the history we now examine as a guide to the affairs at the beginning of the Reign is the account of the *forty days* that the Lord spent in his crucified body before his ascension. The reader should not need to be told (for he should know) that Jesus rose in the same body in which he was crucified, and in that reanimated physical body, he ate, drank, and conversed with his Apostles and friends for forty days. That body was not changed until, like the living saints who will be on the earth at his second personal coming, it was made spiritual, incorruptible, and glorious at the moment of his ascension. Thus, the man Christ Jesus was made like all his brethren in his death, burial, resurrection, transfiguration, ascension, and glorification; or, rather, they will be made to resemble him in all these respects.

The Apostles testify that they saw him ascend — that a cloud received him out of their sight — that angels descended to inform them that he was taken up into heaven, not to return for a long time — that he ascended far above the visible heavens, and now fills all things. Stephen, when dying, saw him standing at the right hand of God.

Much attention is due to all the events of these forty days — at least as much as to the forty days spent by Moses on the mountain with God in the affairs of the preceding Kingdom of God. For the risen Messiah makes the affairs of his approaching kingdom the main topic of these forty days. Towards the end of these days, and immediately before his ascension, he gave the commission to his Apostles concerning the establishment of this kingdom. "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me: go, *therefore,*" he said, "make disciples of all nations," "baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe *all the things* which I have commanded you; and, behold! I am with you always, even to the end of this age." "But stay in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high." Thus, according to his promise and the ancient prophecy, it was to "begin at Jerusalem."

The risen Savior thus directs our attention to Jerusalem as the *place,* and to a time not distant "many days" as the *time* for the beginning of his reign. The great facts of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus, not yet fully understood by his Apostles, left them unprepared to take any steps toward establishing a kingdom that was to be *founded upon Christ crucified.* They needed an interpreter of these facts and a supernatural advocate for the claims of the King before they could lay the foundation of his kingdom.

Again, the King himself must be glorified before his authority could be established on earth; for until he received the promise of the Spirit from his Father and was placed on his throne, the Apostles could not receive it; so Christ's ascension to heaven and coronation were essential to the commencement of this Reign of Heaven.

Here let us pause for a moment — leave the earth, and on the wings of faith in the testimony of Prophets and Apostles, the two witnesses for Jesus, let us follow him to heaven and witness his reception into the heaven of heavens and exaltation to the right hand of God.

***The Ascension of the Messiah***

Prophets and Apostles must now be heard. David, by the Spirit, says, "The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels; the Lord is among them as in Sinai in the holy place. You have ascended on high; you have led captivity captive; you have received gifts for men; yes, for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them." The same Prophet, in speaking of the solemn and joyful procession at the carrying up of the ark of the ancient constitution to Mount Zion, turns his gaze from the type to the antitype, and thus describes the entrance of the Messiah into Heaven: — "Who shall ascend into the hill of God?" The attending angels in the train of the Messiah, approaching the heaven of heavens, shout, "Lift up your heads, O you gates! be lifted up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in." Those inside, astonished that anyone should so confidently demand admission into those gates long barred against the sons of men, respond, "Who is the King of glory?" The angels attending the Messiah reply in triumphant tones, "The Lord, strong and mighty! the Lord, mighty in battle!" and even more triumphantly shout, "Lift up your heads, O you gates! even lift them up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is the King of glory? He is the Lord of hosts! he is the King of glory!"

***Coronation of the Messiah***

Everything in its proper place. He who ascended first descended. Jesus died, was buried, raised from the dead, ascended, and was crowned Lord of all. In the presence of all the heavenly beings, the four living creatures, the twenty-four elders, and ten thousand times ten thousand angels, he presents himself before the throne. As soon as the First Born from the dead appears in the royal palace of the universe, his Father and his God, in his inaugural address, when anointing him Lord of all, says, "Let all the angels of God worship him" — "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." "The Lord shall send out of Zion the rod of your strength: rule in the midst of your enemies. Your people, willing in the day of your power, shall come to you. In the beauty of holiness, more than the womb of the morning, you shall have the dew of your progeny. The Lord has sworn, and will not change his mind. You are a Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. The Lord at your right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath." "Your throne, O God, endures forever: the scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of righteousness. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy above your companions. You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands: they shall perish, but you remain; and they shall all grow old like a garment, and as a vesture, you shall fold them up, and they shall be changed: but you are the same, and your years shall not fail."
Thus God highly exalted him and set him over all the works of his hands, giving him a name and honor above every name in heaven and on earth, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow and every tongue confess, to the glory of God.

"Now we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, so that he might taste death for everyone, because of the sufferings of death, crowned with glory and honor" — Now "angels, authorities, principalities, and powers are subjected to him." "His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon himself shall his crown flourish."

The Holy Spirit, sent down by Jesus from heaven on Pentecost after his resurrection, informed the Apostles of all that had been transacted in heaven during the week after his ascension and until that day. Peter, now filled with that promised Spirit, informs the large crowd gathered on the great day of Pentecost that God had made that Jesus whom they had crucified both Lord and Christ — exalting him as a **Prince** and a Savior to grant repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.

The first act of his reign was the giving of the Holy Spirit, according to the prophecy of Joel and his own promise. As soon as he received the kingdom from God his Father, he poured out the blessings of his favor upon his followers; he fulfilled all his promises to the Apostles and *forgave three thousand of his fiercest enemies.* He received pardons and gifts for those who rebelled and abundantly poured out all spiritual gifts on the small group to whom it pleased the Father to give the kingdom. Thus began the Reign of Heaven on the day of Pentecost, in the person of the Messiah, the Son of God, and the anointed Monarch of the universe. Under him, his people, saved from their sins, have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken or removed.

But just as the construction of the Jewish tabernacle, after the beginning of the first Kingdom of God, took time and required the united effort of those raised up and qualified for the work, so did the complete construction of the new temple of God. The Apostles, as wise master builders, laid the foundation — proclaimed the constitution, laws, and institutions of the King, and raised the standard of the kingdom in many towns, cities, and countries for forty years. Some of them not only witnessed "the Son of Man enter upon his reign" and the Kingdom of God begin on Pentecost, carrying his conquests over Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth; but they also saw the Lord "come with power" and great glory, fulfilling all his predictions regarding the abandoned and doomed temple, city, and people. Thus they witnessed a bright display of the golden scepter of his grace in forgiving those who submitted to his authority, and a terrifying display of the iron rod of his wrath in taking vengeance on his enemies who would not have him reign over them.

***Present Administration of the Kingdom of Heaven***

During the personal absence of the King, he has entrusted the management of this kingdom to stewards. These were first the Apostles; next, Prophets; then, teachers; followed by assistants or helpers; and finally directors or presidents, all equipped with gifts, knowledge, and character suited to their respective roles. In addition to these, many individuals with miraculous powers — gifts of healing and speaking foreign languages — were employed in establishing and organizing the communities that make up the Kingdom of Heaven. Angels were also employed, and continue to be employed, under the great King in ministering to those who are heirs of salvation. For Jesus, now as Lord of all, has the Holy Spirit at his disposal, along with all the angels of God; and these are employed by him in the affairs of the kingdom.

The Apostles were plenipotentiaries and ambassadors for Jesus, having all authority delegated to them from the King. Therefore, everything was first taught and commanded by them. They were the first preachers, teachers, pastors, overseers, and ministers in the kingdom, and they directed and managed all its affairs.

The communities gathered and organized by the Apostles were called the *congregation of Christ,* and collectively, they are sometimes referred to as *the Kingdom of God.* However, the terms "church of God" or "congregation of Christ," and "Kingdom of Heaven" or "Kingdom of God," do not always represent the same thing. The elements of the Kingdom of Heaven, it should be noted, are not simply its subjects, and therefore not just the congregations of disciples of Christ. But since these communities possess the oracles of God, are under the laws and institutions of the King, and therefore enjoy the blessings of present salvation, they are recorded in the Kingdom as the only constitutional citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven; and to them exclusively belongs *all the present salvation.* Their King is now in heaven, but present with them by his Spirit in their hearts and in all the institutions of his kingdom.

Every baptized believer of good character is, by the constitution, a free and full citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven, entitled to all the social privileges and honors of that kingdom. Those who meet regularly in one place in obedience to the King, or his ambassadors the Apostles, for the observance of all the institutions of the King, form a family, or house, or congregation of Christ; and all these families or congregations, thus organized, constitute the present Kingdom of God in this world. Thus, the phrases *Kingdom of Heaven* and *the congregation* or *body of Christ* are equivalent in meaning.

Now, in gathering these communities and organizing them, the Apostles had, while alive, and still have through their writings, the sole right to legislate, order, and manage all things. However, it is not the will of Jesus Christ, because it is not suited to human nature, nor to the current state of his kingdom as administered in his absence, that the church should be governed by a *written* document alone. Therefore, in every city, town, and country where the Apostles gathered a community through their own personal efforts or through their assistants, they consistently appointed elders, or overseers, to labor in the word and teaching, and to oversee all the affairs of the community. They also appointed *deacons,* or public *ministers* of the congregation, who, under the direction of the overseers, were to manage all the affairs of these individual families of God. This is what the very names *Bishop* and *Deacon,* and all qualifications entail.

But since all the citizens of the kingdom are free individuals under Christ, they all have a voice in selecting the persons whom the Apostles appoint to the offices. The Apostles still appoint all persons elected, provided they possess the qualifications that they *by the Holy Spirit* prescribed. *And if a congregation refuses to elect to these offices the persons possessing these qualifications; or if, due to their own stubbornness and selfishness, they elect those unqualified, thus disregarding those marked out by the possession of those gifts; in either case, they despise the authority of the *Ambassadors of Christ and must face the consequences.* It is, indeed, the Holy Spirit, and not the congregations, that creates Bishops and Deacons. The Spirit provides the qualifications, both natural and acquired; and, speaking to the congregations in the written oracles, commands their ordination or appointment to the work.

In the present administration of the Kingdom of God, *faith is the* **principle**, *and ordinances the* **means** *of all spiritual enjoyment.* Without faith in the testimony of God, a person is without God, without Christ, and without hope in the world. A universe without Christ, as it pertains to spiritual life and joy, is the most complete void that imagination can create. Without faith, nothing in the Bible can be enjoyed; and without it, there is no Kingdom of Heaven for humanity in all the dominions of God.

In the kingdom of nature, *sense* is the *principle,* and *ordinances* the *means* of enjoyment. Without sense or sensation, nothing in nature can be known or enjoyed. All the creative, restorative, and renewing power, wisdom, and goodness of God, exhibited in nature, are contained in ordinances. The sun, moon, and stars — the clouds, the air, the water, the seasons, day and night, are therefore called the *ordinances* of heaven, because God's power, wisdom, and goodness are *in* them, and felt by us only *through* them. Now, sense, without the ordinances of nature, like faith without the ordinances of religion, would be no *principle* of enjoyment; and the ordinances of nature, without sense, would be no *means* of enjoyment. These are the unchangeable decrees of God. There are no exceptions to them; and there is no reversal of them. To illustrate and emphasize the doctrine of this single paragraph is worthy of a volume. The essence, the whole essence of that reformation for which we contend, is wrapped up in this decree as expressed above. If it is true, the ground on which we stand is firm and unchangeable as the Rock of Ages; if it is false, we build upon the sand. *Reader, examine it well!*

In the Kingdom of Heaven, faith is, then, the *principle,* and ordinances the *means* of enjoyment; because all the wisdom, power, love, mercy, compassion, or *grace of God* is in the ordinances of the Kingdom of Heaven; and if all grace is in them, it can only be conveyed through them. What, then, under the present administration of the Kingdom of Heaven, are the ordinances that contain the grace of God? They are preaching the gospel — immersion in the name of Jesus, into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit — the reading and teaching of the Living Oracles — the Lord's day — the Lord's supper — fasting — prayer — confession of sins — and praise. To these may be added other appointments of God, such as exhortation, admonition, discipline, etc.: for these also are ordinances of God; and indeed all statutes and commandments are ordinances: but we are not currently discussing those ordinances which concern the good order of the Kingdom, but those which are primary means of enjoyment. These primary and sacred ordinances of the Kingdom of Heaven are the means of our individual enjoyment of the present salvation of God.
Without the sun, there is no solar influence; without the moon, there is no lunar influence; without the stars, there is no sidereal influence; without the clouds, there can be no rain; and without the ordinances of the Kingdom of Heaven, there can be no heavenly influence exhibited or felt. There is a unique and distinctive influence exerted by the sun, moon, and stars; yet they all provide light. Similarly, in the ordinances of the Kingdom of Heaven — although they all work together to produce certain similar effects on the subjects of the kingdom, there is something distinctive and unique in each of them, so that none can be substituted for another. Not one of them can be omitted; they are all necessary for the full enjoyment of the Reign of Heaven.

In nature and in religion, all the blessings of God given to humanity can be categorized under two heads. These may be referred to, for illustration, as *antecedent* and *consequent.* The antecedent includes all those blessings given to humanity to prepare them for action and to motivate them to act. The consequent are those which God bestows on humanity through a course of action that corresponds to these antecedent blessings. For example, all that God did for Adam in creating the earth and everything in it — animal, vegetable, mineral; in forming him in his own image; giving him all his physical, intellectual, and moral powers; and granting him all the personal and real estate that elevated him above all earthly beings — were antecedent to any action of Adam; and these provided him with reasons to love, honor, and obey his Creator and benefactor. All that God did for Abraham in promises and commands before his obedience — all that he did for the Israelites in bringing them out of Egypt and redeeming them from Pharaoh's tyranny — was antecedent to the duties and observances he required of them. And all the blessings that Adam, Abraham, and the Israelites enjoyed through their adherence to the institutions under which they were placed were consequent upon the mindset and actions that the antecedent favors demanded and inspired. *God never commanded any being to do anything without providing the power and motives derived from something God had done for them.*

In the Kingdom of Heaven, the antecedent blessings are the constitution of grace, the King, and all that he did, suffered, and endured for our redemption. These were completed before we came onto the stage of action. This is all favor, pure favor, sovereign favor: for there can be no favor that is not free and sovereign. But the forgiveness of our sins, our adoption into the family of God, and our being made heirs and inheritors of the kingdom of glory are consequent upon faith and the obedience of faith.

Organization and life of any kind are necessarily gifts from God; but health and the continued enjoyment of life, along with all its various and numerous blessings, are consequent upon the proper exercise of these gifts. He who will not breathe, eat, drink, sleep, or exercise cannot enjoy physical life. God has given animal organization and life antecedent to any action of the living creature; but the creature may forfeit its life by refusing to sustain it through the means essential to its preservation and comfort.

God made only one man from the earth, and one earthly *nature* of every kind, through a positive, direct, and immediate act of wisdom, power, and goodness. He granted these the ability, according to his own constitution or *system* of nature, to reproduce and multiply indefinitely. Yet this life is transmitted, diffused, and sustained by God working through the system of nature. Similarly, Jesus, in the new creation, by his Spirit sent down from heaven after his glorification, did through a positive, direct, and immediate act create one congregation, one mystical or spiritual body; and, according to the constitution or system of the Kingdom of Heaven, gave that mystical body, created in Jerusalem, out of the more ancient earthly Kingdom of God, the power to reproduce and multiply indefinitely. Yet this new and spiritual life is transmitted, diffused, and sustained by the Spirit of God, operating through the constitution or system of grace ordained in the Kingdom of Heaven.

Thus, in establishing the Kingdom of Heaven, as in establishing the kingdom of nature, there was a display of divinity, compared to everything that followed, that is properly supernatural. Hence the array of Apostles, prophets, extraordinary teachers, gifts, powers, miracles, etc. But after this new mystical body of Christ was created, it had, and still has, according to the system of grace under the current administration of the Kingdom of Heaven, the power to multiply and fill the whole earth, *and will do so;* for just as God breathed into Adam's nostrils the spirit of life after raising him from the dust, and as he bestowed upon his beloved Son Jesus, after he rose from the water, the Holy Spirit without measure; so at the formation of the first congregation, figuratively called the *body of Christ,* Jesus breathed into it the Holy Spirit to animate and inhabit it until he comes again. The only temple and dwelling on earth, since Jesus pronounced desolation on that in Jerusalem, is the body of Christ.

Now, the first congregation of Christ, thus filled with the Spirit of God, had the power to raise other congregations of Christ; or, in other words, to cause the body of Christ to grow and increase. Thus we see that other congregations were soon established in Judea and Samaria by the members of the Jerusalem body. Many were brought to God by the Spirit of God through the members of the first congregation. And since the Spirit himself ceased to operate in all those spectacular displays of supernatural grandeur, he continues to keep the disciples of Christ always in remembrance of the things spoken by the holy Apostles, and by all the arguments derived from the antecedent blessings bestowed, working in them both to will and to act according to the benevolence of God, he is still causing the body of Christ to grow and increase in *stature,* as well as in knowledge and favor with God. Thus, the church of Christ, inspired by his Spirit and having the oracles and ordinances of the Reign of Heaven, is fully capable of converting the whole world, if she does not prove unfaithful to her Lord.

In the work of conversion, her Evangelists, or those whom she sends beyond the confines of her weekly meetings, have, under the influence of the Spirit of God, simply to present the constitution, or the good news of the Reign, to those outside; and by all the arguments that the oracles of God and the times and occasions suggest, to urge and persuade people to be reconciled to God, to kiss the Son, to accept the constitution, and to submit to him who is ordained as a Prince and a Savior to grant repentance and forgiveness of sins to all who accept his governance. Thus, they, along with the congregation that sends them forth and supports them in their work, bring children to God through the gospel and expand the body of Christ.

With all these documents before us, can we not say that, just as Eve was the mother of all living, so "Jerusalem is the mother of us all?" And thus, to use the language of Paul, "People are brought to God by the gospel" through the efforts of the congregations of Christ.

Under the current administration of the Kingdom of Heaven, a significant apostasy has occurred, as foretold by the Apostles. As the church, compared to a city, is called "Mount Zion," the apostate church is referred to as "Babylon the Great." Like the original Babylon, "Mystery Babylon," the antitype, is to be destroyed by a Cyrus who does not know God. She is to fall by the sword of infidels, supported by the fierce judgments of God. "The Holy City" is still trampled underfoot, and the sanctuary is filled with corruptions. It is, indeed, a den of thieves; but strong is the Lord who judges the apostate city. Until that great and notable day of the Lord comes, we cannot, from the prophetic word, expect a universal return to the original gospel, nor a general restoration of all the institutions of the Kingdom of Heaven in their primitive form; and, consequently, we cannot promise ourselves the universal subjugation of the nations to the scepter of Jesus.

However, if we were to consider the administration of the affairs of the kingdom after the fall and overthrow of the apostate city and the conversion of the Jews, we would have to embark on a vast and turbulent ocean, for which our slender vessel is not currently equipped. This may yet warrant the construction of a larger vessel in a more favorable season. Meanwhile, the original gospel is widely proclaimed, and many thousands are preparing for the day of the Lord; and these are taught by the "Faithful and True Witness" that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night, and that their happiness and safety depend on being prepared for his second coming.

1. These essays do not appear in the order in which they were written and published. We place the last-written first; because, in the natural order of things, general views of the nature of the Christian kingdom should precede the specific development of its unique institutions. They first appeared in the form of *extras* to the regular series of the Millennial Harbinger; and as we thought it wise to preserve them, as much as possible, in their original form, this will explain several repetitions that may appear in them.

`  `All the leading and characteristic principles of that reformation for which we advocate, as far as the gospel institution is concerned, can be learned from them. Much, indeed, of the proof of some of the propositions found in these essays lies scattered across several volumes; but a concise view of the evidence supporting them, which is sufficient for the reader's conviction in most cases, will be found embodied in them. Those, however, who may not be completely satisfied with the arguments presented must be referred to the various discussions of these principles found in the Christian Baptist and Millennial Harbinger.

Luke 8:10, — Matt. 11:11. Luke 7:28. To this distinct evidence, many more could be added. What Matthew calls "the Kingdom of *Heaven,*" Mark and Luke refer to as "the Kingdom of *God.*"

# Introduction

"I pray for those who will believe in me through their teaching, *that all may be one*; that as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, *they also may be in us, so that the world may believe* that you have sent me, and that you gave me the glory that I have given them, so that *they may be one,* as we are one; I in them, and you in me, *that their unity may be perfected*: and that *the world may know* that you have sent me, and that you love them as you love me." Thus the Messiah prayed; and he had good reason to pray this way, knowing that, "If a kingdom is divided by factions, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a family is divided by factions, that family cannot stand. Civil strife can devastate any kingdom; and no city or family can survive where such strife exists."

If this is true—and it is true; if Jesus is the Messiah—then what moral desolation exists in the kingdom of Jesus Christ! Has there ever been, or is there now, a kingdom more torn apart by internal conflicts and divisions than what is commonly referred to as the church of Jesus Christ? If anyone thinks it acceptable to exclude one hundred million members of the Greek and Roman churches from the visible and invisible realms of the Christian family or kingdom of Jesus Christ, and to view the Protestant faith and people as the only true faith and the only true citizens of the kingdom of Jesus—what then can we say about them, viewed as the visible kingdom over which Jesus presides as Prophet, Priest, and King? Of forty million Protestants, shall we define the visible kingdom of the Prince of Peace? Let’s say we do, for the sake of argument; and then what? The Christian army is forty million strong. But how do they come together? Under forty banners?—Under forty opposing leaders? I wish there were only forty! In the Geneva faction alone, there are nearly as many petty chiefs. My soul aches at the details!

Consider the English branch of the Protestant faith—I mean England, the United States, and all the islands where the English Bible is read; how many conflicts, divisions, and anathemas can we count? I will not attempt to name the opposing creeds, feuds, and factions that are in constant battle under the banners of the Prince of Peace. And yet they speak of love and charity, and of converting the Jews, the Turks, and Pagans!!!

Shall we turn away from this picture, put down our pens, and sink into despair? No! For Jesus has said, "Blessed are *the peacemakers,* for they shall be called *children of God.*" But who can make peace when all the elements are at war? Who is so enthusiastic as to believe they can stop the flood of conflict or extinguish the flames of sectarian strife! Yet the pages of universal history whisper in our ears, If you wait until all the warring factions lay down their arms and make a spontaneous and simultaneous effort to unite, you will be as foolish as the one who sat by the Euphrates, waiting for all its waters to flow into the sea.

We are so optimistic—perhaps many will say, so unrealistic—as to imagine that a *nucleus* has been formed, or may be formed; around which all the children of God may one day gather. No one, in any case, can say that it is either impious or immoral—that it is inhumane or unchristian—to think about the current state of Christ's kingdom; or to reflect on the possibility or practicality of any plan to gather the children of God under the banner of the Cross alone. No one can claim that such an endeavor is completely unrealistic unless they deny the Messiah's proposition and assert that the current wars and conflicts must continue and multiply throughout all time, and that God will convert the entire world, *without answering the prayer of his Son*; or rather, on a plan contrary to that which he proclaimed, and in spite of all the moral desolation that has resulted from the conflicts and battles of five hundred sects over fifteen hundred years!

Does anyone dare to say, or even think in an unkind or malicious way, that it is wrong to make an effort to rally the fragmented forces of Zion's King, and to encourage them to turn their weapons away from each other and toward the common enemy? With such a person, it would be worse than pointless to reason or exchange a single argument. Should we not rather consider it the most honorable, acceptable, and commendable endeavor that any mortal can undertake on this earthly stage? And since God has always brought about the most remarkable revolutions through the most humble agents and by means that seem unlikely according to human wisdom, we believe it is not inappropriate or out of place to make an effort and extend our hands toward the work of peace and love.

From the Messiah's intercession quoted above, it is undeniable that unity is strength, and disunity is weakness; that there is a plan based on infinite wisdom and love, by which, and which alone, the world may both *believe* and *know* that God has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. And like all the plans of Heaven, it is admirably simple. No mortal should think that they will have the honor of devising either the plan to unite Christians in one holy band of zealous cooperation, or of converting Jews and Gentiles to the faith that Jesus is that *seed* in whom all the families of the earth are yet to be blessed. The plan is divine. It is ordained by God; and, better still, it has already been revealed. Is anyone eager to hear it? Let them read again the intercessions of the Lord Messiah, which we have chosen for our motto. Let them then examine the two following propositions and consider whether these do not express Heaven's own scheme for increasing and uniting the body of Christ.

**First.** Nothing is essential to the conversion of the world but the unity and cooperation of Christians.

**Second.** Nothing is essential to the unity of Christians but the Apostles' teaching or testimony.

Or does he prefer to express the plan of the Self-Existent in different words? Then he may change the order and say,

**First.** The testimony of the Apostles is the only and all-sufficient means of uniting all Christians.

**Second.** The unity of Christians with the Apostles' testimony is all-sufficient, and alone sufficient, for the conversion of the world. Neither truth alone nor unity alone is sufficient to subdue the unbelieving nations; but truth and unity combined are omnipotent. They are *omnipotent* because God is in them and with them, and has consecrated and blessed them for this very purpose.

These two propositions have been stated, illustrated, developed—and shall I say proven—in the *Christian Baptist* and *Millennial Harbinger* to the conviction of thousands. Indeed, one of them is as universally accepted as it has been proposed, namely: *That the unity of Christians is essential* *to the conversion of the world*; and though perhaps some might be found who would question whether, if all Christians were united, the whole world could be converted to God; there is no person we have heard of who acknowledges a general or universal prevalence of the gospel—in what is usually called the millennial age of the world—and who believes that moral means will play any role in its introduction, who does not also agree that the unity of Christians is essential to that state of affairs. Indeed, to suppose that all Christians will form one communion in that happy age of the world, and not before it, is to assume a moral effect without a cause.

The second proposition, namely—*That the word or testimony of the Apostles is itself all-sufficient, and alone sufficient, for the unity of all Christians,* cannot be rationally doubted by anyone familiar with that testimony, or who accepts the competency of their inspiration to make them infallible teachers of the Christian faith. And indeed, all who argue for those human institutions called creeds do so only as necessary for the existence of a party, or while the current schisms, conflicts, and divisions exist. Therefore, all defenses of creeds, ancient and modern, while asserting that the Bible alone is the only perfect and infallible rule of faith and morals; not only concede that these symbols called creeds are imperfect and fallible, but also that these creeds can never achieve what the Bible, without them, can accomplish.

But how to do without them seems to be an insurmountable difficulty for many well-meaning Christians. To elaborate on this point would be outside our current purpose; especially since it has already been fully discussed in the present controversy.

It is perhaps sufficient at this time to pose the question, How has what is called the church fared with them? Have they not been the root cause or occasion of all the discord, schisms, and factions now present in Christendom? And will not a very superficial observation and a little experience convince everyone that the rivers flow to the sea just as surely as creeds and human devices in religion lead to discord and division? Take, for example, two of the most popular creeds of today—the Westminster and that of the Methodist—with whose history American society is more familiar than with that of any other, and evaluate the tree by its fruits—judge their impact based on their practical effects on society. To say nothing of the smaller schisms within the party that once formed one communion on the basis of the Westminster creed, we can now count no less than nine separate communions—all professing the Westminster articles, in substance or in form. These include the General Assembly in Scotland and the United States, the Cameronians or Solemn League and Covenant Presbyterians, the Burghers or Unionists, the Anti-Burghers or Seceders, the Relief Presbyterians, the Cumberland Presbyterians, and the New School, which is on the verge of being born. To these might be added those known as English Presbyterians, who are now more commonly referred to as Independents and Congregationalists; and indeed, the Glassites or Sandemanians, who emerged from the synod of Angus and Mearns in 1728. Thus, in one hundred and ninety years, nine or ten distinct communions have arisen from the Westminster creed. Some of them, too, are as discordant and distant from each other as the Jews and Samaritans.
Nor have the Methodists in England, Canada, and the United States done much better for their time. They now form five or six separate denominations, under different names. Not to mention the Whitefieldite Methodists, those of John Wesley include the Wesleyan Methodists, the New Connection of Methodists, the Methodist Episcopal Church, the O'Kelly Methodists, the Radicals, and so on.

And what should I say about the twelve or fourteen sects of Baptists — many of whom have as much affection for the Greek and Roman churches as for one another! It would be pointless to provide further evidence that human opinions, inferential reasoning, and deductions from the Bible, presented in the form of creeds, can never unite Christians; as all their outcomes are alienation, repulsion, bickering, and division. *No human creed in Protestant Christendom can be found that has not caused a division in every generation of its existence.* And I may add — the more thoughtful, curious, and intelligent the community that adheres to a creed, the more frequent their debates and divisions.

But the Bible will not fare any better if people approach it with a set of opinions or a human symbol in their minds. For then it is not the Bible, but the opinions in the mind, that form the bond of unity. Indeed, people would be better off having a *written* rather than an *unwritten* standard of orthodoxy if they refuse to abandon speculation and abstract notions as any part of Christian faith or duty.

However, all these modes of faith and worship are based on a misunderstanding of the true nature of Revelation, which it has long been our effort to correct. For us, Revelation has nothing to do with opinions or abstract reasoning; it is founded entirely on *facts.* There is not one abstract opinion, not one speculative view, asserted or communicated in the Old Testament or New. Moses begins by asserting facts that occurred in creation and providence; and John concludes by asserting prophetic or prospective facts in the future displays of providence and redemption. Facts, then, are the *alpha* and the *omega* of both Jewish and Christian revelations.

But so that the reader may have before them a summary view of the entire scheme of unity and cooperation that the Living Oracles and the current state of Christianity in the world demand — which has been illustrated and supported at different times and in various ways in the present controversy against divisions — we will present it in one statement.

*Let* **the Bible** *replace all human creeds*; **facts**, *for definitions*, **things**, *for words*; **faith**, *for speculation*; **unity of faith**, *for unity of opinion*; **the positive commandments of God**, *for human legislation and tradition*; **piety**, *for ceremony*; **morality**, *for partisan zeal*; **the practice of religion**, *for the mere profession of it; — and the work is done.*

For the illustration of the leading terms and their correlates found in this *project*, and for a full development of our meaning (as we may or may not be understood if interpreted by the polemic vocabulary of this age) — we will introduce some excerpts from the *Christian Baptist* and *Millennial Harbinger*, developing our meaning and containing some of the key positions that have been fully discussed in a twelve-year controversy.

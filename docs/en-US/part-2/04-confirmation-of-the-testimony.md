# 4. Confirmation of the Testimony

All revealed religion is based on facts. Testimony pertains only to facts; and for that testimony to be credible, it must be confirmed. These points are so important that they deserve some illustration and much consideration. By *facts*, we always mean something said or done. The works of God and the words of God, or the things done and spoken by God, are those facts that are laid down and exhibited in the Bible as the foundation of all faith, hope, love, piety, and humanity. All true and useful knowledge is an acquaintance with facts. And all true science is acquired from the observation and comparison of facts. But the one who made the heart of man and gave him an intelligent spirit knows that facts alone can move the affections and command the passions of man. Hence, the scheme of mercy that he has revealed to the world is all contained in, and developed by, *the works of mercy* that he has performed.

Facts have a meaning that the understanding comprehends, and the heart feels. According to the meaning or nature of the fact, is its effect on us. If a friend has risked his life or sacrificed his reputation or fortune to help us, we cannot help but trust and love him. If an enemy has attempted our life, invaded our property, or attacked our reputation, we cannot, naturally, help but hate him. Nothing but the command of a benefactor or the will of some dear friend, who has put us under obligation to him, can prevent us from hating our enemies. If a beloved relative has suffered some great misfortune, we must feel sorry; or if he has been rescued from some impending calamity, we must feel glad. Our joy in the latter case and our sorrow in the former arise from the meaning or nature of the fact. The feelings corresponding with the nature of the fact are excited or called into existence the moment the fact is known or believed. It is *known* when we have witnessed it ourselves, and it is *believed* when reported to us by credible persons who have witnessed it. This is the main difference between faith and knowledge.

As existence or beings must precede knowledge, so facts must precede either knowledge or belief. An event must happen before it can be known by man — it must be known by some before it can be reported to others — it must be reported before it can be believed, and the testimony must be confirmed, or made credible, before it can be relied on.

Something must be done before it can be known, reported, or believed. Hence, in the order of nature, there is first the fact, then the testimony, and then the belief. A was drowned before B reported it — B reported it before C believed it, and C believed it before he was grieved by it. This is the unchangeable and universal order of things concerning belief. In this example, when we reason from effect to cause, it is *grief, belief, testimony, fact* — and from cause to effect, it is *fact, testimony, belief, grief.* We ascend from grief to belief — from belief to testimony — from testimony to fact. We descend from fact to testimony — from testimony to belief — and from belief to grief. There is no exception to this, just as there is no exception to the universality of the law of gravity. If, then, there was nothing said or done, there could be no testimony, and thus no faith. Religious affections spring from faith; and therefore, it is important that this subject should be disentangled from the mysticism of the schools.

Laws call for obedience, and testimony for belief. Where there is no law, there can be no obedience; and when there is no testimony, there can be no faith. As obedience cannot exceed law, so faith cannot exceed testimony. John's testimony pertains to many facts. We can believe based on his testimony only as far as he has testified. The same goes for all the other witnesses. The certainty of faith depends on the certainty or credibility of the witnesses. But not so its effects. The *effects* depend on the facts believed — the *certainty* on the evidence. I may be equally certain that John was beheaded — that Jesus was crucified. Indeed, I may be as certain of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem as I am of his death on Calvary. The testimony may be equally credible, and the faith equally strong; but the effects produced are not the same. The facts believed do not have the same meaning, are not of the same nature, and do not produce the same feelings or effects. I may be as certain of the assassination of Caesar in the Senate House as I am of the crucifixion of Jesus on Calvary: but as the facts believed are as diverse in their nature, meaning, and implications for me, as the East and the West; so the effects or fruits of my faith are as different as Julius Caesar and Jesus Christ.

The more ordinary the fact, the more ordinary the testimony necessary to establish it. That A B, aged 90, and confined for some time with illness, died last night, requires only the most ordinary testimony to make it credible. But that C D lived to 140, enjoying unbroken vigor of mind and body, requires stronger testimony. Still, all facts occurring in accordance with the ordinary and natural laws of things require only good human testimony to make them worthy of belief. It is only extraordinary and supernatural facts that require supernatural testimony, or testimony supernaturally confirmed. This is the point we have been looking at in this essay. And now that we have arrived at it, I would ask, *How has the testimony of the Apostles and Evangelists been confirmed?*

To *confirm a testimony* is neither more nor less than to make it credible to those to whom it is presented; or, to express the same idea in other words, it is to give people the power to believe. Now, it will not require the same amount of evidence to persuade an astronomer that the earth's shadow struck the moon during the last eclipse as it would to convince an Indian; nor would it require the same amount of evidence to convince a chemist that combustion was caused by pouring water on a certain mixture of minerals as it would an uneducated person. To make any testimony credible to any group of people, regard must therefore be had to the capacity, knowledge, and habits of those people. To confirm the testimony of the Apostles concerning the Messiah's death, resurrection, ascension into heaven, and coronation as the Lord and King of the Universe, means that it should be made credible in every way to beings like us, or that we should be made able to believe. A testimony *confirmed,* and yet *incredible* to those to whom it is presented, is a contradiction in terms. But why emphasize the word *confirmed?* Because the holy Apostles have emphasized it. It is therefore necessary that we should pay due attention to the confirmation of the testimony. The testimony is one thing, and the confirmation is another. It is necessary, in all important matters in human affairs, that the testimony received between people should be confirmed by some sanction. Hence an oath for confirmation of testimony is an end of all strife. The highest confirmation that people require in all questions of facts is a solemn oath or affirmation that the things affirmed are true.

But supernatural facts require supernatural confirmations. Hence when the confirmation of the gospel is mentioned in the apostolic writings, it is resolved into the actions or works of the Holy Spirit. '*Demonstrations of the Holy Spirit* are the confirmatory proofs of the gospel. When Paul delivered the testimony of God, or the testimony concerning Jesus, to the Corinthians, he says, '*It was confirmed among them.*' And if we examine the confirmation of the testimony as Paul explained it, we will find that he makes the spiritual gifts, or those extraordinary and miraculous powers that the Apostles themselves displayed, and which many of their converts also possessed, an assurance or confirmation of what he proclaimed.

We will only focus on the insight that one of his letters to the Corinthians provides on this subject. After thanking God for the favor bestowed upon the disciples of Corinth when he first visited them, he proceeds to specify the special favors given to the disciples in that renowned city. 'You were enriched (he says, chap. 1: ver. 5) with every gift by him, even with *all speech* and *all knowledge* when the testimony of Christ was confirmed among you: so that you come behind in *no gift.*' 'There are different kinds of gifts, (he says, chap. 12:) for to one disciple is given *the word of wisdom;* to another, *the word of knowledge;* to another, *faith* (to be healed); to another, *the gift of healing;* to another, *the ability to work miracles in others;* to another, *prophecy;* to another, *discerning of spirits;* to another, *different kinds of foreign languages;* and to another, *the interpretation of foreign languages.*' — Now, the Corinthians were given these (for they came behind in no gift) 'when the testimony of Christ was confirmed among them.' For, says Paul, I came not to you with the excellence of speech or the persuasive eloquence of the schools, but with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your belief in my testimony, or your faith, might not rest, or be founded upon human wisdom or eloquence, but upon the power of God shown in the demonstrations of the Spirit that confirmed my testimony among you. For had it not been for these demonstrations of the Spirit and power, your faith could not have rested upon an unshakeable foundation.

To those eager to understand this subject, an examination of this first letter to the Corinthians cannot fail to be most instructive; for it clearly and unequivocally teaches us that the *visible, audible, sensible* demonstration of the Spirit and power was that supernatural attestation of the testimony of Christ which made it credible, so that no one could have acknowledged Jesus of Nazareth to be the Almighty Lord except through this demonstration of the Holy Spirit. Thus was the testimony confirmed — thus was Jesus demonstrated to be the only begotten Son of God — and thus, and thus only, are people enabled to believe in him.

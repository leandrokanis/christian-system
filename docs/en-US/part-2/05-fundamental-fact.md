# 5. Fundamental Fact

Amid the uncertainty, darkness, and vice that cover the earth, the Messiah appears and lays a foundation of hope, true religion, and religious unity that is unknown, unheard of, and unexpected among people. The Jews were united by blood relations and by agreement on a heavy ritual. The Gentiles gathered under every opinion and were grouped, like steel filings around a magnet, under every possible shade of difference in thought regarding their mythology. As long as unity of opinion was seen as a proper basis for religious unity, humanity has been distracted by the multitude and variety of opinions. Establishing what is called a system of orthodox opinions as the bond of unity was, in fact, offering an incentive for new diversities in opinion and for an endless increase of opinions, sects, and divisions. And what is worse than all, it was establishing self-love and pride as religious principles, fundamental to salvation; or a love regulated by similarity of opinion is merely a love for one's own opinion; and all the zeal shown in its defense is just the workings of pride in opinion.

When the Messiah appeared as the founder of a new religion, systems of religion consisting of opinions and speculations about matter and mind, about God and nature, about virtue and vice, had been adopted, improved, reformed, and rejected time after time. It was generally felt, and eventually universally acknowledged, that there was always something superfluous, something defective, something wrong, something that could be improved in every system of religion and morality. But the grandeur, sublimity, and beauty of the foundation of hope and of ecclesiastical or social unity established by the author and founder of Christianity lay in this: **the belief in one fact**, *and that based on the best evidence in the world, is all that is necessary, as far as faith goes, for salvation. The* *belief in this* **one fact** *and submission to* **one institution** *that expresses it, is all that is required by Heaven for admission into the church.* A Christian, as defined not by Dr. Johnson or any creed-maker, but by one taught from Heaven, is someone who believes this *one fact*, has submitted to *one institution*, and whose behavior aligns with the morality and virtue of the great Prophet. The one fact is expressed in a single statement — *that Jesus the Nazarene is the Messiah.* The evidence on which it is to be believed is the testimony of *twelve men*, confirmed by prophecy, miracles, and spiritual gifts. The *one institution* is baptism in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Every such person is a disciple in the fullest sense of the word the moment they believe this one fact, based on the evidence above, and have submitted to the institution mentioned above; and whether they believe the five points condemned or the five points approved by the Synod of Dort is not even to be asked of them; whether they hold any views of the Calvinists or Arminians, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists, or Quakers, is never to be asked of such individuals for admission into the Christian community called the church. The only reasonable doubt that can arise on these points is whether this *one fact*, in its nature and necessary results, can suffice for the salvation of the soul, and whether the open acknowledgment of it, in the act of baptism, can be a sufficient recommendation of the person professing it to the confidence and love of the brotherhood. Regarding the first of these, it is repeatedly asserted, in the clearest language, by the Lord himself, and by the Apostles Peter, Paul, and John, that whoever believes the testimony that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, can overcome the world, has eternal life, and is, based on God's truth, saved from their sins. This should settle the first point; for the witnesses agree that whoever confesses that Jesus is the Christ and is baptized should be accepted into the church; and not a single instance can be found of anyone being asked for any other belief for admission in the entire New Testament. The Savior explicitly told Peter that upon this fact, that he was the Messiah, the Son of God, he would *build his church*; and Paul has explicitly stated that "no other foundation can anyone lay (for ecclesiastical unity) than that **Jesus is the Christ**." The point we have assumed is proven; and with this proof, everything necessary for the unity of all Christians on a proper basis is established.

It must strike every thoughtful person that a religion requiring much mental abstraction or intricate refinement of thought, or that demands the comprehension or even understanding of refined distinctions and subtle nuances, is a religion not suited to humanity in their current circumstances. To present such a creed as the Westminster, as adopted, either by Baptists or Paido-Baptists; such a creed as the Episcopalian, or, in fact, any sectarian creed, composed as they all are of propositions derived from logical inferences and expressed in philosophical language, to all those who are suitable subjects for the salvation of Heaven — I say, to present such a creed for their examination or acceptance shocks all common sense. This harmful approach is what has paganized Christianity. Our sects and parties, our disputes and speculations, our orders and castes resemble anything but Christianity so much that when we enter a modern synagogue or an ecclesiastical council, we seem to have entered a Jewish Sanhedrin, a Muslim mosque, a pagan temple, or an Egyptian cloister, rather than a Christian congregation. Sometimes, indeed, our religious meetings resemble the Areopagus, the Forum, or the Senate so closely that we almost believe we have been transported to Athens or Rome. Even Christian speakers emulate Demosthenes and Cicero. Christian doctrines are made to take on the appearance of Egyptian mysteries, and Christian practices adopt the pomp and pageantry of pagan ceremonies. Unity of opinion, expressed in adherence to lengthy dogmas imported from Geneva, Westminster, Edinburgh, or Rome, is made the bond of unity: and a difference in the tenth or ten thousandth shade of opinion often becomes the actual cause of division or expulsion. The New Testament was not intended to occupy the same place in theological seminaries that the bodies of criminals are condemned to occupy in medical halls — first doomed to the gallows, and then to the dissecting table of the spiritual anatomist. Christianity consists infinitely more in good works than in sound opinions; and while it is a joyful truth that whoever believes and is baptized shall be saved, it is equally true that whoever says, 'I know him,' and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

# 6. Purity of Speech

If I were to classify the entire Christian institution into *three* chapters, following the style of modern schools for clarity, I would label them Christian *faith*, Christian *worship*, and Christian *morality*. To these, modern thinkers have added two others, which I would call human *philosophy* and human *traditions*. In the first chapter, we, along with all Christians, are in agreement: Christian faith pertains to *the matters of fact* recorded — to the direct testimony of God found in the New Testament about Himself — about His Son and Spirit — about humanity — what He has done, and what He will do; there is no debate on this. I find that all *confessions of* **faith**, properly understood, like the *four* gospels, tell the same story regarding matters of fact or faith.

In the second chapter, we also agree that God is to be worshipped through the Mediator — in prayer, in praise, both public and private — in the ordinances of Christian baptism, the Lord's Day, the Lord's Supper, and in the devotional study of His word and His works of creation and providence.

In the third chapter, we all acknowledge the same moral code. What morality is, is recognized and accepted by all; however, in practice, there are significant shortcomings.

We reject the two remaining chapters as having any place in our faith, worship, or morality because we believe we have discovered that all divisions in Protestant Christendom — all the factionalism, pointless arguments, and heresies that have tarnished the Christian profession — have originated from human philosophy and human tradition. It is not faith, nor piety, nor morality; but philosophy and tradition that have divided and alienated Christians and hindered the conversion of the world. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle do not deserve the title of philosophers if Calvin, Arminius, and Wesley do not as well. The former philosophized morally on nature and ancient tradition — the latter, on the Bible and human society.

Religious philosophers on the Bible have developed the following doctrines and philosophical distinctions: —

'The Holy Trinity,' 'Three persons of one substance, power, and eternity,' 'Co-essential, co-substantial, co-equal,' 'The Son eternally begotten of the Father,' 'An eternal Son,' 'Humanity and divinity of Christ,' 'The Holy Spirit eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son,' 'God's eternal decrees,' 'Conditional and unconditional election and reprobation,' 'God out of Christ,' 'Free will,' 'Liberty and necessity,' 'Original sin,' 'Total depravity,' 'Covenant of grace,' 'Effectual calling,' 'Free grace,' 'Sovereign grace,' 'General and particular atonement,' 'Satisfy divine justice,' 'Common and special operations of the Holy Spirit,' 'Imputed righteousness,' 'Inherent righteousness,' 'Progressive sanctification,' 'Justifying and saving faith,' 'Historic and temporary faith,' 'The direct and reflex acts of faith,' 'The faith of assurance, and the assurance of faith,' 'Legal repentance,' 'Evangelical repentance,' 'Perseverance of the saints,' 'Falling from grace,' 'Visible and invisible church,' 'Infant membership,' 'Sacraments,' 'Eucharist,' 'Consubstantiation,' 'Church government,' 'The power of the keys,' etc. etc.

Regarding these and all such doctrines, and all the speculations and terminology they have generated, we have the privilege neither to affirm nor deny — neither to believe nor doubt; because God has not proposed them to us in His word, and there is no command to believe them. If they are derived from the Scriptures, we have them in the facts and declarations of God's Spirit; if they are not derived from the Bible, we are free from all the difficulties and conflicts they have caused.

*We choose to speak of biblical things using biblical words,* because we are always cautious that if a word is not in the Bible, the idea it represents may not be there; and we are always confident that the truths taught by God are better expressed in the words and under the names that the Holy Spirit has chosen and designated than in the words that human wisdom provides.

There is nothing more essential to the unity of Christ's disciples than *purity* of speech. As long as humanity spoke one language, the human family was united. Had they then spoken a pure language as well as one language, they would not have been scattered. God, in His righteous anger, dispersed them; and before He scattered them, *He divided their language*. One of His prophets, who lived in a corrupt age and prophesied against the wrongs of his time, when he spoke of better days, of an age of unity and communion, was commanded to say in the name of the Lord, 'Then will I turn to the people a *pure language,* that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve Him *with one consent.*' Purity of speech is here declared to be a prerequisite to serving the Lord with one consent.

'The words of the Lord are pure words.' To have a pure speech, we must choose the language of Canaan and abandon that of Ashdod. And if we wish to be of one mind, we must 'speak the same thing.' This was Paul's plan for unity, and no one can suggest a better one.

It requires little reflection to realize that the fiercest disputes about religion are about what the Bible does *not* say, rather than about what it *does* say — about words and phrases created in the realm of speculative theology. The *homousios* and the *homoousios* from the memorable Council of Nice are a prime example. People are neither wiser, more knowledgeable, nor better after they learn the meaning of these terms than they were before. As far as is known on earth, there is no one in 'the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world' whose conversion or sanctification to God resulted from any of these debates about human doctrines, nor from anything learned from the canons or creeds of all the Councils, from Nice to the latest Methodist Conference.

It is a virtue, then, to forget this academic jargon, and even the names of the doctrines that have shaken Christendom. It is a concession necessary for the crisis we are in, for the sake of peace, to adopt the vocabulary of Heaven and to return the borrowed terminology of the schools to its rightful owners — to speculate no more on the opinions of Saint Augustine, Saint Tertullian, Saint Origen — to speak of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit — of the gospel, of faith, of repentance, of baptism, of election, of the death of Christ, of His mediation, of His blood, of reconciliation, of the Lord's Supper, of atonement, of the church of God, etc. etc. in all the phrases found in the Record, without bias — to learn to love one another as much when we differ in opinion as when we agree, and to distinguish between the testimony of God and human reasoning and philosophy about it.

I need not say much about the chapter of *human traditions*. They are easily distinguished from the *Apostles' traditions*. Those of the Apostles are found in their writings, while those of men are found in their own books. Some human traditions may appear wise, but only superficially. As long as it is written, 'In vain do you worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,' it will always be presumptuous folly to add the commandments of men to the precepts of Jesus Christ. I know of only one way in which all believers in Jesus Christ, honorably to themselves, honorably to the Lord, and beneficially to all humanity, can form one communion. All have two chapters too many in their current ecclesiastical constitutions. The contents of these two chapters vary among all the sects, but they all include these two chapters under some name. In some, they are long, and in others, they are short; but whether long or short, let everyone agree to tear them out of their books and burn them, and be satisfied with *faith, piety,* and *morality*. Let human philosophy and human tradition, as any part of the Christian institution, be thrown overboard into the sea, and then the ship of the church will make a prosperous, safe, and happy voyage across the ocean of time, and finally, under the triumphant flag of Immanuel, find a safe anchorage in the haven of eternal rest.

I would appeal to every honorable, good, and loyal citizen of the kingdom of Heaven — to everyone who seeks the good of Zion, who loves the kingdom and the appearing of our common Lord and Savior — whether such a concession is not due to the Lord, to the saints in heaven and on earth, and to all of humanity in the crisis we currently face; and whether we could propose less, or ought to demand more, than to make one whole burnt offering of all our "empty and deceitful philosophy," — our "science, falsely so called," — and our traditions received from our fathers. I would leave it to the good sense of every rational mind to determine whether such a whole burnt offering would not be the most acceptable peace offering that could be presented on the altar of the Prince of Peace in our day; and whether, under the teachings of the Apostles of the Great Prophet, the church might not again triumphantly stand on the holy ground that she so honorably occupied before Origen, Augustine, Athanasius, or the first Pope was born!

7, 8, 9 These are examples of scriptural phrases that have been misapplied: the corruption of Christianity has been completed by the influence of barbarian language and by the new uses of the sacred style.

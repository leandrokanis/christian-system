# 3. Faith

*No testimony, no faith:* for faith is simply the belief in testimony, or confidence in testimony as true. To believe without testimony is just as impossible as to see without light. The measure, quality, and power of faith are always found in the testimony believed.

Where testimony begins, faith begins; and where testimony ends, faith ends. We believe Moses only as far as Moses speaks or writes: and when Moses has recorded his last fact or testified his last truth, our faith in Moses ends. His five books are, therefore, the length and breadth, the height and depth, or, in other words, the *measure* of our faith in Moses. The *quality* or value of faith is found in the quality of the testimony. If the testimony is valid and authoritative, our faith is strong and effective. 'If,' says John, 'we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater,' stronger, and more worthy of credit. The value of a banknote is the amount of precious metals it represents and the indisputable evidence of its authenticity; similarly, the value of faith is the importance of the facts presented by the testimony and the assurance that the testimony is true. True, or genuine faith, can be contrasted with false faith; but true faith is the belief in truth: for he who believes a lie believes in vain.

The *power* of faith is also the power, or moral significance of the testimony, or of the facts that the testimony represents. If by faith I am filled with joy or overwhelmed with sorrow, that joy or sorrow is in the facts contained in the testimony or in the nature and relation of those facts to me. If faith purifies the heart, works through love, and overcomes the world, this power is in the facts believed. If a father has more joy in believing that a lost son has been found than in believing that a lost sheep has been brought home to his fold, the reason for this greater joy is not in the nature of his belief, but in the nature of the facts believed.

Here I am led to elaborate on a very popular and harmful error of modern times. The error is that the nature, or power and saving efficacy of faith, is not in the truth believed, but in the *nature* of our faith, or in *the manner of believing* the truth. Hence all that meaningless jargon about the nature of faith, and all those disdainful sneers at what is called "historic faith," — as if there could be any faith without history, written or spoken. Who has ever believed in Jesus Christ without hearing the history of him? '*How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?*' Faith can never be more than receiving testimony as true, or believing testimony; and if that testimony is written, it is called history — though it is just as much history when spoken as when written.

Let it be repeated and remembered that there is no other way to believe a fact than by receiving it as true. If it is not received as true, it is not believed; and when it is believed, it is regarded as true. This being acknowledged, it follows that the efficacy of faith is always in the fact believed, or the object received, and not in the nature or manner of believing.

"Faith was bewildered much by men who meant  
To make it clear, so simple in itself.  
  
A thought so rudimental and so plain,  
That none by comment could it plainer make.  
  
All faith was one. In object, not in kind,  
The difference lay. The faith that saved a soul,  
And that which in the common truth believed,  
In essence, were the same. Hear, then, what faith,  
True Christian faith, which brought salvation, was:  
Belief in all that God revealed to men;  
Observe, in all that God revealed to men,  
In all he promised, threatened, commanded, said,  
Without exception, and without a doubt."<sup>2</sup>

This holds universally in all the sensitive, intellectual, and moral powers of humanity. All our pleasures and pains, all our joys and sorrows, are the effects of the objects of sensation, reflection, faith, etc., that are apprehended or received, and not in the nature of the exercise of any capacity with which we are endowed. We shall illustrate and confirm this assertion by appealing to the experience of all.

Let us glance at all our sensitive powers. If, when surveying a beautiful landscape, I feel pleased, and when surveying a battlefield strewn with the spoils of death, I feel pained, — is it accurate to say that the pleasure or the pain received was caused by the nature of vision, or the way of seeing? Was it not *the sight,* the thing seen, the object of vision, that produced the pleasure and the pain? The action of looking, or the way of seeing, was the same in both cases; but the things seen, or the objects of vision, were different; — consequently, the effects produced were different.

If, when hearing the melody of the grove, I feel delighted, and when hearing the peals of thunder breaking apart the dark, horror-filled cloud overhead, I feel terrified, — is the delight or the terror to be attributed to the manner or nature of hearing, or to the thing heard? Is it not the thing heard that produces the delight or the terror?

If I am refreshed by the sweet fragrance of the blooming spring or sickened by the foul smell of decaying carcasses, — are these effects to be attributed to the peculiar nature or way of smelling, or to the thing smelled? Or when the honey and the gall come into contact with my taste, — is the sweet or the bitter to be regarded as the effect of my manner of tasting, or of the object tasted? And when I touch the ice or the blazing torch, — is the effect or feeling produced due to the manner of feeling them, or to the thing felt? Can we not affirm that all the pleasures and pains of sense; all the effects of sensation; are the results, not of the manner in which our five senses are exercised, but of the objects on which they are exercised? It may be said, without in the least invalidating this conclusion, that the more intimate the exercise of our senses is with the things on which they are exercised, the stronger and more forceful the impressions made will be: but still it is the object seen, heard, smelled, tasted, or felt that affects us.

Moving from the outward to the inward person, and examining the powers of intellect one by one, we will find no exception to the law that governs all our sensitive powers. It is neither the faculty of perception nor the manner of perception, but the thing perceived that excites us to action: it is not the exercise of reflection, but the thing reflected upon: it is not memory, nor the exercise of recollection, but the thing remembered: it is not imagination, but the thing imagined: it is not reason itself, nor the exercise of reason, but the thing reasoned upon, that provides pleasure or pain — that excites action — that cheers, attracts, consoles — that grieves, disturbs, or troubles us.

Ascending to our choices and our feelings, we will find the same universality. In short, it is not choosing or refusing; it is not loving, hating, fearing, desiring, or hoping; it is not the nature of any power, faculty, or capacity of our nature, nor the simple exercise of them, but the objects or things upon which they are exercised that give us pleasure or pain; that induce us to action, or influence our behavior. Faith, then, or the power of believing, must be an unusual thing; a power *sui generis;* an exception to the laws under which every power, faculty, or capacity of humanity is placed, unless its measure, quality, power, and efficacy are in the facts that are testified, in the objects on which it focuses.

There is no connection of cause and effect more intimate; there is no system of dependencies more closely linked; there is no arrangement of things more natural or necessary than the ideas represented by the terms *fact, testimony, faith,* and *feeling.* The first is for the last, and the two intermediates are made necessary by the force of circumstances, as the means for the end. The fact, or the thing said to be done, produces the change in the frame of mind. The testimony, or the report of the thing said or done, is essential to belief; and belief in it is necessary to bring the thing said or done to the heart. The change of heart is the end proposed in this part of the process of regeneration; and we can see that the process on the part of Heaven is, thus far, natural and rational; or, in other words, consistent with the constitution of our nature.<sup>3</sup>

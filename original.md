Preface to the Second Edition 

**The** present edition substitutes, for the first part of the last, a series of essays on the Christian System; and somewhat enlarges on the second. The continual misrepresentation and misconception of our views on some very fundamental points of the Christian system seem at the present crisis, to call for a very definite, clear, and connected view of the great outlines and elements of the Christian Institution;  and  more  especially  with  a  reference  to  a  great question, which we anticipate soon to be the all-absorbing question of Protestant Christendom, viz. — *How may schisms cease, and all Christians  unite,  harmonize  and  co-operate  in  one  great community, as at the beginning?* 

Things  ecclesiastic  are  moving  forward  to  a  new  issue.  The Christian system is undergoing an examination in the present day, both as to its evidences and signification, wholly unprecedented since the days of the grand defection. Such an age is always an age of extremes: but things will regulate themselves and settle down on the true foundation. "Many are running to and fro;" and certainly knowledge is on the increase. 

The Christian system, as unfolded in the following essays, would, but  for  the  special  essays  on  the  "Kingdom  of  Heaven," "Remission  of  Sins,"  "Regeneration,"  and  "Breaking  the  Loaf," have been more systematically and fully developed. Sundry points are but  meagerly discussed in  the new essays,  because of their recurrence in those elaborate  articles  which have been so often published. We have, indeed, aimed first at giving a general view, leaving  the  important  details  on  the  most  disputable  points  for those essays. 

Instead of the "Dialogue on the Holy Spirit," so generally read and so fully discussed, we have added a few essays on **Church** **Order** as a part of the Christian system: thus endeavoring to give to the book all the chances of being as useful as possible to those who are desirous  of  a  more  perfect  understanding  of  our  attainments  in Christian knowledge. We speak for ourselves only; and while we are always willing to give a declaration of our faith and knowledge of  the  Christian  system,  we  firmly  protest  against  dogmatically propounding our own views, or those of any fallible mortal, as a condition or foundation of church union and co-operation. While, then, we would, if we could, either with the tongue or the pen, proclaim all that we believe, and all that we know, to the ends of the earth, *we take the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible, as the foundation of all Christian union and communion.* Those who do not like this will please show us a more excellent way.

Part I: The Christian System 

1. The Universe 

**One** God, one system of nature, one universe. That universe is composed of innumerable systems, which, in perfect concert move forward in subordination to one supreme end. That one end of all things is the sovereign and infinite pleasure of Him who inhabits eternity and animates the universe with his presence. So worship and adore the heavenly hierarchies, saying: — "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created." 

The  universe  is  a  system  of  systems,  not  only  as  respects  the seventy-five millions of suns and their attendant planets, which fill up the already discovered fields of ethereal space; but in reference to the various systems, separate, though united; distinct, though amalgamated; heterogeneous, though homogeneous; which are but component  parts  of  every  solar  system — of  every  planet  in  that system, and of every organic, and every inorganic mass on each planet. Thus in the person of a single individual man, we have an animal system, an intellectual system, a moral system, running into each  other,  and  connecting  themselves  with  every  thing  of  a kindred nature in the whole universe of God: just as we have in the human body itself a system of solids, and a system of fluids; and these again forming themselves into a system of bones, a system of nerves, a system of arteries, a system of veins, etc. 

Now as no one system is insular and independent, no system can be understood abstractly. Every particular system must be viewed in reference to that system which is proximate to it in nature and use. Thus we view the bones in the human body as connected with the muscles, the muscles as connected with the nerves, the nerves as connected with the arteries, the arteries as connected with the veins — and these all as connected with all the human frame, and with the fluids evolved by them, or circulated through them, etc. 

As, then, the systems of the universe and the sciences which treat of them, run into each other and mutually lend and borrow light, illustration, and development; it is a mark of imbecility of mind, rather than of strength; of folly, rather than of wisdom; for any one to dogmatize with an air of infallibility, or to assume the attitude of perfect intelligence on any one subject of human thought, without an  intimate  knowledge  of  the  whole  universe.  But  as  such knowledge is not within the grasp of feeble mortal man, whose horizon is a point of creation, and whose days are but a moment of time, it is superlatively incongruous for any son of science, or of religion, to affirm that this or that issue is absolutely irrational, unjust,  or  unfitting  the  schemes  of  eternal  Providence,  or  the purposes of the supreme wisdom and benevolence, only as he is guided by the oracles of infallible wisdom, or the inspirations of the Almighty. Who could pronounce upon the wisdom and utility of  a  single  joint,  without  a  knowledge  of  the  limb  to  which  it belongs;  of  that  limb,  without  an  understanding  of  the  body  to which it ministers; of that body, without a clear perception of the world in which it moves, and of the relations which it sustains; of that world, without some acquaintance with the solar system of which it is but a small part; of that particular solar system, without a general and even intimate knowledge of all the kindred systems; of all these kindred systems, without a thorough comprehension of the ultimate design of the whole creation; of that ultimate design, without a perfect intelligence of that incomprehensible Being by whom,  and  for  whom  all  things  were  created  and  made?  How gracefully, then, sits unassuming modesty on all the reasonings of man. The true philosopher and the true Christian, therefore, delight always to appear in the unaffected costume of humility, candor, and docility —  

- **He who through the vast immensity can pierce,**  

  `  `**See  worlds  on  worlds  compose  one universe;**  

`  `**Observe how system into system runs,   What other planets circle other suns,**  

`  `**What varied beings people every star,** 

`  `**May tell why God has made us as we are." P**OPE.

2. The Bible 

One  God,  one  moral  system,  one  Bible.  If  nature  be  a  system, religion is no less so. God is "a God of order," and that is the same as to say he is a God of system. Nature and religion, the offspring of the same supreme intelligence, bear the image of one father; twin sisters of the same Divine parentage. There is an intellectual and a moral universe as clearly bounded as the system of material nature.  Man  belongs  to  the  whole  three.  He  is  an  animal, intellectual, and moral being. *Sense* is his guide in nature, *faith* in religion, *reason* in both. The Bible contemplates man primarily in his spiritual and eternal relations. It is the history of nature, so far only as is necessary to show man his origin and destiny; for it contemplates nature, the universe, only in relation to man's body, soul, and spirit. 

The Bible is to the intellectual and moral world of man, what the sun is to the planets in our system; — the fountain and source of light and life, spiritual and eternal. There is not a spiritual idea in the whole human race, that is not drawn from the Bible. As soon will the  philosopher  find  an  independent  sunbeam  in  nature,  as  the theologian a spiritual conception in man, independent of **The** **One** **Best** **Book**. 

The Bible, or the Old and New Testaments, in Hebrew and Greek, contains a full and perfect revelation of God and his will, adapted to man as he now is. It speaks of man as he was, and also as he will hereafter be; but it dwells on man *as he is,* and *as he ought to be,* as its peculiar and appropriate theme. It is not, then, a treatise on man as he was, nor on man as he will be, but on man as he is, and as  he  ought  to  be;  not  as  he  is  physically,  astronomically, geologically, politically, or metaphysically; but as he is and ought to be *morally* and *religiously.* 

The words of the Bible contain all the ideas in it; — these words, then, rightly understood, and the ideas are clearly perceived. The words and sentences of the Bible are to be translated, interpreted, and understood according to the same code of laws and principles of interpretation by which other ancient writings are translated and understood; for when God spoke to man in his own language, he spoke as one person converses with another, in fair, stipulated, and well  established  meaning  of  the  terms.  This  is  essential  to  its character  as  a  revelation  from  God;  otherwise  it  would  be  no revelation, but would always require a class of inspired men to unfold and reveal its true sense to mankind. 

We have written frequently and largely upon the principles and rules of interpretation, as of essential importance and utility in this generation  of  remaining  mysticising  and  allegorizing.  From  our former  writings,  we  shall  here  only  extract  the  naked  rules  of interpretation, deduced from extensive and well digested premises; fully  sustained,  too,  by  the  leading  translators  and  most distinguished  critics  and  commentators  of  the  last  and  present century. 

***Rule* 1**. On opening any book in the sacred Scriptures, *consider first the historical circumstances of the book. These are the order, the title, the author, the date, the place, and the occasion of it.* 

The *order* in historical compositions is of much importance; as, for instance, — whether the first, second, or third, of the five books of Moses,  or  any  other  series  of  narrative,  or  even  epistolary communication. 

The  *title*  is  also  of  importance,  as  it  sometimes  expresses  the *design* of the book. As *Exodus* — the departure of Israel from Egypt; *Acts of Apostles, etc.* 

The  peculiarities  of  the  *author* — the  age  in  which  he  lived — his style — mode of expression, illustrate his writings. The date, place, and occasion of it, are obviously necessary to a right application of anything in the book. 

***Rule*  2**.  In  examining  the  contents  of  any  book,  as  respects precepts, promises, exhortations, etc. *observe who it is that speaks, and under what dispensation he officiates.* Is he a Patriarch, a Jew, or  a  Christian?  *Consider  also  the  persons  addressed;  their prejudices, characters, and religious relations.* Are they Jews or Christians — believers  or  unbelievers — approved  or  disapproved? This rule is essential to the proper application of every command, promise, threatening, admonition, or exhortation, in Old Testament or New. 

***Rule*  3**.  To  understand  the  meaning  of  what  is  commanded, promised, taught, etc. *the same philological principles,  deduced from the nature of language; or the same laws of* *interpretation which are applied to the language of other books, are to be applied to the language of the Bible.* 

***Rule*  4**.  *Common  usage,  which  can  only  be  ascertained  by testimony, must always decide the meaning of any word which has but  one  signification;* — but  when  words  have  according  to testimony (i. e. the dictionary,) more meanings than one, whether literal or figurative, *the scope, the context, or parallel passages must decide the meaning:* for if common usage, the design of the writer,  the  context,  and  parallel  passage  fail,  there  can  be  no certainty in the interpretation of language. 

***Rule*  5**.  *In  all  tropical  language,  ascertain  the  point  of resemblance, and judge of the nature of the trope, and its kind, from the point of resemblance.* 

***Rule*  6**.  In  the  interpretation  of  symbols,  types,  allegories,  and parables, this rule is supreme: *ascertain the point to be illustrated; for comparison is never to be extended beyond that point — to all the  attributes,  qualities,  or  circumstances  of  the  symbol,  type, allegory, or parable.* 

***Rule* 7**. For the salutary and sanctifying intelligence of the Oracles of God, the following rule is indispensable —  

*We must come within the understanding distance.* 

There is a distance which is properly called *the speaking distance,* or the *hearing distance;* beyond which the voice reaches not, and the ear hears not. To hear another, we must come within that circle which the voice audibly fills. 

Now we may say with propriety say, that as it respects God, there is  an  understanding  distance.  All  beyond  that  distance  cannot understand  God;  all  within  it,  can  easily  understand  him  in  all matters of piety and morality. God, himself, is the centre of that circle, and humility is its circumference. 

The wisdom of God is as evident in adapting the light of the Sun of Righteousness to our spiritual or moral vision, as in adjusting the light of day to our eyes. The light reaches us without an effort of our own; but we must open our eyes, and if our eyes be sound, we enjoy the natural light of heaven. There is a sound eye in reference to spiritual light, as well as in reference to material light. Now, while the philological principles and rules of interpretation enable many  men  to  be  skillful  in  biblical  criticism,  and  in  the interpretation of words and sentences; who neither perceive nor admire  the  *things*  represented  by  those  words;  the  sound  eye contemplates the things themselves, and is ravished with the moral scenes which the Bible unfolds. 

The  moral  *soundness*  of  vision  consists  in  having  the  eyes  of understanding  fixed  soley  on  God  himself,  his  approbation  and complacent affection for us. It is sometimes called a *single* eye, because it looks for one thing supremely. Every one, then, who opens  the  Book  of  God,  with  *one  aim,*  with  one  ardent desire — intent only to know the will of God; to such a person, the knowledge of God is easy: for the Bible is framed to illuminate such, and only such, with the salutary knowledge of things celestial and divine. 

Humility of mind, or what is in effect the same, contempt for all earth-born pre-eminence, prepares the mind for the reception of this light; or, what is virtually the same, opens the ears to hear the voice of God. Amidst the din of all the arguments from the flesh, the world, and Satan, a person is so deaf that he cannot hear the still small voice of God's philanthropy. But receding from pride, covetousness, and false ambition; from the love of the world; and in  coming  within  that  circle,  the  circumference  of  which  is unfeigned humility, and the centre of which is God himself — the voice of God is distinctly heard and clearly understood. All within this circle are taught by God; all without it are under the influence of the wicked one. 'God resisteth the proud, but he giveth grace to the humble.' 

He, then, that would interpret the Oracles of God to the salvation of  his  soul,  must  approach  this  volume  with  the  humility  and docility of a child, and meditate upon it day and night. Like Mary, he must sit at the Master's feet, and listen to the words which fall from his lips. To such a one there is an assurance of understanding, a certainty of knowledge, to which the man of letters alone never attained, and which the mere critic never felt. 

The Bible is a book of facts, not of opinions, theories, abstract generalities, nor of verbal definitions. It is a book of awful facts, grand and sublime beyond description. These facts reveal God and man,  and  contain  within  them  the  reasons  of  all  piety  and righteousness; or what is commonly called religion and morality. The meaning of the Bible facts is the true biblical doctrine. History is therefore the plan pursued in both Testaments; for testimony has primarily to do with faith, and reasoning with the understanding. History has, we say, to do with facts — and religion springs from them. Hence, the history of the past, and the anticipations of the future, or what are usually called history and prophecy, make up exactly four-fifths of all the volumes of inspiration. 

3. God 

"**I am that** **I am**." "I lift up my hand to heaven and say, *I live for ever.*" "The *everlasting God,* the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary; there is no searching of his *understanding.*"  "His  understanding  is  infinite."  "Do  not  I  *fill* heaven and earth, saith the Lord?" "For thus saith the *high* and *lofty* one that *inhabiteth eternity,* whose name is *Holy,* I dwell in the high and holy place; with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones." "I beseech thee, show me thy *glory,* and he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee; and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show  mercy."  "And  the  Lord  passed  by  before  him1  and 

proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long suffering,  abundant  in  goodness  and  truth,  keeping  mercy  for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and sin, and that by no means aquits the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation" — "and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments." "O Lord God of Israel, who dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even  *thou  alone,*  thou  hast  made  heaven  and  earth.  Hear,  O Israel — Jehovah our Aleim is one Jehovah2 — the Lord our God is one Lord." "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which wast, and art, and art to come." "Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, just and true are thy ways, thou king of saints." "Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name, for thou only art holy," "He is the Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are judgment; a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is 

he." "Glorious in holiness, fearful in praise, doing wonders." 

Such are a few — a specimen of the Divine declarations concerning himself; repeated and re-echoed by the purest and most intellectual beings in heaven and earth. It is from his word and his works we learn the being and perfections of God. As we form a character of man from what he says and what he does, so learn we the Divine character.  "The  heavens  declare  his  glory,  and  the  firmament showeth forth his handy work: day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge." Creation reveals the power, the wisdom, and the goodness of God. Providence proclaims also his justice, truth, and holiness. Redemption develops his mercy, condescension, and love; and all these are again characterized by infinity, eternity, immutability. Nature, then, attests and displays the knowledge, wisdom, power, and goodness of God. The law and the  providence  of  God  especially  declare  his  justice,  truth,  and holiness — while the gospel unfolds his mercy, condescension, and love;  and  all  these  proclaim  that  God  is  infinite,  eternal,  and immutable. God appears before the universe of intellectuals, in the threefold  attitude  of  Creator,  Lawgiver,  and  Redeemer;  and although  each  of  these  involves  and  reveals  many  of  his excellencies, still in each department three are most conspicuous. As  Creator,  knowledge,  wisdom,  power,  and  goodness;  as Lawgiver,  justice,  truth,  and  holiness;  as  Redeemer,  mercy, condescension, and love. In each and all of which departments, he is infinite, immutable, and eternal. 

But the Scriptures speak of his divinity or godhead, as well as of the  unity,  spirituality,  and  eternity  of  his  being.  We  have  not, indeed, much said upon this incomprehensible theme; for — who by searching can find out God, or know the Almighty to perfection? The knowledge of him  is  high as heaven, what  canst  thou  do? deeper than hell, what canst thou know? The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. 

Paul and Peter indeed speak of the divine nature in the abstract, or of the divinity or godhead. These are the most abstract terms found in the Bible. Eternity and divinity are however equally abstract and almost equally rare in holy writ. Still, they are necessarily found in the divine volume; because we must abstract *nature* from *person* before  we  can  understand  the  remedial  system.  For  the  divine nature  may  be  communicated  or  imparted  in  some  sense;  and indeed while it is essentially and necessarily singular, it is certainly plural in its personal manifestations. Hence we have the Father, Son,  and  Holy  Spirit  equally  divine,  though  personally  distinct from each other. We have in fact, but one God, one Lord, one Holy Spirit;  yet  these  are  equally  possessed  of  one  and  of  the  same divine nature. 

Some conceive of God as mathematical unit; and as a thing cannot be both mathematically singular and plural, one and three, at the same time and in the same sense, they deny the true and proper divinity of the Son of God and of the Spirit of God. But it would seem to us, that they reason not in harmony with the sacred style of inspiration.  But  why  should  we  imagine  that  there  cannot  be  a plurality of personal manifestations in the divine nature any more than in the angelic or human, especially as man was created in the image of God? 

The *relations* in human plurality are indeed limited to *three.* For while all the human nature was at one time originally and wholly in  the  person  of  Adam,  it  was  afterwards  found  equally  in  the person of Eve — and again in the person of their first born. Now as to its derivation and mode of existence, it was diverse in the three. In Adam it was underived as respected human nature, in Eve it was derived from Adam, and in Cain it was again derived from Adam and  Eve.  Here  the  matter  ends;  for  while  Eve  proceeded  from Adam in one mode, and Cain proceeded from Adam and Eve in another, all the residue of human nature is participated without any new relation or mode of impartation. While, then, our nature is plural as to its participation, it is limited to three relations or modes of existence. Now as man was made in the image of God, we must conceive  of  him  as  having  plurality,  relation,  and  society  in himself — though far be it from us to suppose that the divine nature either is, or can be fairly or fully exhibited by any resemblance or illustration drawn from angel or from man, or from any created thing. Still, there is a resemblance between God and the sun that shines  upon  us — between  God  and  an  angel — between  God  and man; and even in the mode of his existence, and in the varieties of relation and personal manifestation, there is so much resemblance as to peremptorily forbid all dogmatism as to what is, or is not, compatible with the unity, spirituality, and immutability of God. But  of  this  more  fully  and  intelligibly  when  we  shall  have examined the record concerning the **word** and the **spirit** of God. 

**1 Moses.  **

**2 So reads the Hebrew. Deut. 6:4.** 

4. The Son of God 

“The holy progeny (or thing) which shall be born of thee shall be called *the Son of God.*" "Unto us a child is born; unto us a son is given,  and  the  government  shall  be  upon  his  shoulder,  and  his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting  Father,  the  Prince  of  Peace."  "This  is  my  Son,  the beloved, in whom I delight." "This is my Son, the beloved, hear him." "No person has ascended into heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man, who is in heaven," or whose abode is in heaven. "God so loved the world that he gave his *only begotten Son;* the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." "No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son who is the bosom of the Father has declared him." "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the king of Israel." "Glorify thou me with thine ownself, with  the glory which  I had with thee before the world was." "In him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead1 bodily," 

or substantially. "He is  the first  and the last." "All things were created by him and for him." "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made." "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory: the glory as of an only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." 

So speak the Divine oracles of the supreme Deity and excellency of the author and perfecter of the Christian system. "By him and for him" all things were created and made; and "he is before all things,  and  by  him  all  things  consist."  But  "he  became  flesh." Who?  He  that  existed  before  the  universe,  whose  mysterious, sublime, and glorious designation was the **word** of God. Before the Christian system, before the  *relation* of "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit" began to be, his rank in the divine nature was that of the **word of god**. Wonderful name! Intimate and dear relation! The relation between a word and the idea which it represents is the nearest  of  all  relations  in  the  universe:  for  the  idea  is  in  the word — and the word is in the idea. The idea is invisible, inaudible, unintelligible, but in and by the word. An idea cannot be without an image or a word to represent it — and therefore God was never without his word, nor was his word without him. "The word was with  God,  and  the  Word  was  God" — for  a  word  is  the  idea *expressed* — and thus "the word that was made flesh," became "the brightness of his  glory" and "the  *express image* of his person," insomuch that "he who has seen the Son has seen the Father also." 

While, then, the phrase "Son of God" denotes a temporal relation, the  phrase  "the  word  of  God"  denotes  an  eternal,  unoriginated relation. There was a *word of God* from eternity, but the Son of God began to be in the days of Augustus Cesar. "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee." He was by his resurrection from the dead declared to be the Son of God with a power and evidence extraordinary  and  divine.  The  **word**  incarnate  or  dwelling  in human flesh, is the person called our Lord and Redeemer, Jesus Christ — and while, in the system of grace, the Father is the  *one God,* in all the supremacy of his glory — Jesus is the *one Lord* in all the divine fulness of sovereign, supreme, and universal authority. The Lord of Shem, of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, is the God and the Lord of Christians: for "the child" that has been born to us — and "the son" that has been given, according to another prophet, came from  eternity.  "His  goings  forth  have  been  from  of  old,  from everlasting."2 Such is the evangelical history of the author of the 

Christian system as to  his antecedent nature and relation in the Deity or Godhead. 

He became a true and proper **Son of** **Man**." "A body hast thou prepared me." But the "me" was before "the body." It dwelt forever "in the bosom of the Father." "I came forth from God," said "the Incarnate  Word."  Great  beyond  expression  and  "without controversy, great is the mystery — the secret of godliness." "God was  manifest  in  the  flesh."  "He  that  has  seen  me  has  seen  the Father  also."  The  Son  of  Man  was  and  is  the  Son  of God — "Emmanuel, God with us." Adored be his name! The one God  in  the  person  of  the  Father,  has  commanded  all  men  to worship and honor the one Lord, as they would honor him that sent him: for now in glorifying the Son, we glorify the Father that sent him and that dwells in him. "Know yet not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me." Thus spake our Lord Jesus Christ. 

**1 The Apostle here used the word *Theotees.* Col. 2:9, which is but once found in the New Testament. We have, indeed, *Theiotees,* Rom.  1:20,  from  the  same  Apostle,  also  found  but  once, translated  "  *Godhead.*"  We  have  also  *Theios,  Theion,*  three times; once Acts 17:29, translated divinity, and by Peter, (2 Pe 1:3-4),  twice,  once  in  connection  with  *power*  and  once  with *nature.* " His divine power" — "a divine nature." " The fulness of the Deity," or Godhead, indicates all divine excellency — all the perfections of God. The term *Deity* imports the divine nature, state, or being of God. " The *fulness*" of that divine nature is here contrasted with an *empty* and deceitful philosophy, (verse 8,) and the term *bodily* superadded, shows that God is in Christ not  as  he  was  in  the  tabernacle  or  temple,  typically,  but substantially, literally, and truly.**  

**2 Mic 5:2.** 

5. The Spirit of God 

As there is man and the spirit of man, so there is God and the spirit of  God.  They  are  capable  of  a  separate  and  distinct  existence. "What man knoweth the things of a man," says Paul, "but the spirit of man that is in him; even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God." There is in this case an image of God in man — not, indeed, an exact image, but an image; for as Paul says of the  law,  so  say  we  of  man;  "For  the  law  had  a  shadow,  (a resemblance) of good things to come, and not the very (or exact) image of the things." So man was made an image of God, though not the exact image — the active power of man is in his spirit: so John the Baptist came in the *power* of Elijah, because he came in his *spirit.* The spirit of God is therefore often used for his power; though  it  is  not  an  impersonal  power,  but  a  living,  energizing, active,  personal  existence.  Hence,  in  all  the  works  of  God,  the spirit  of  God  is  the  active,  operating  agent.  Thus  in  the  old creation, while ancient chaos yet remained — when "the earth was without form, and void, and darkness brooded on the bosom of the vast  abyss,"  "the  spirit  of  God  moved" — (incubated  and energized) — "upon the face of the waters." "The hand of the Lord has made me, and the spirit of the Almighty has given me life." "The  Holy  Spirit  shall  come  upon  thee,  and  the  *power*  of  the Highest shall overshadow thee;" and thus was chaos subdued, man vitalized, "the heavens garnished," and the body of Jesus made by the spirit of God. 

The Spirit is said to do, and to have done all that God does and all that God has done. It has ascribed to it all divine perfections and works; and in the New Testament it is designated as the immediate author  and  agent  of  the  new  creation,  and  of  the  holiness  of Christians. It is therefore called *the Holy Spirit.* In the sublime and ineffable relation of the Deity, or godhead, it stands next to the Incarnate Word. Anciently, or before time, it *was* **God**, the **Word** of God, and the **Spirit** of God. But now, in the development of the Christian  scheme,  *it  is*  "the  Father,  the  Son,  and  the  Holy Spirit" — one God, one Lord, one Spirit. To us Christians there *is,* then, but one God, even the Father; and one Lord Jesus Christ, even the Savior; and one Spirit, even the Advocate, the Sanctifier, and the Comforter of Christ's body, the church. Jesus is the *head,* and the Spirit is the *life* and animating principle of that body. 

The whole systems of creation, providence, and redemption, are founded upon these relations in the Deity. Destroy these, blend and confound these, and nature, providence, and grace, are blended, confounded, and destroyed. The peerless and supreme excellency of  the  Christian  system  is,  that  it  fully  opens  to  the  vision  of mortals the Divinity — the whole Godhead employed in the work of man's regeneration and ultimate glorification. God is manifest in human  flesh,  and  is  justified  and  glorified  by  the  Spirit,  in accomplishing  man's  deliverance  from  ruin.  Each  name  of  the sacred three has its own peculiar work and glory in the three great works of Creation, Government, and Redemption. Hence, we are by divine authority, "immersed into the name of the **Father**, the **Son**, and the **Holy** **Spirit**," in coming into the kingdom of grace; and while in that kingdom the supreme benediction is — "The *Grace* of  the  **Lord**  **Jesus**  **Christ**,  and  the  *love*  of  **God**,  and  the *communion* of the **Holy** **Spirit** be with you!" Indeed in the old church  that  was  in  the  wilderness,  while  matters  were comparatively in the shadows of a moonlight age, the high priest of Israel was commanded to put "the *name* of God" upon the children of Israel — in the same relation of the scared three. "The Lord1 bless 

thee and keep thee. The Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be *gracious* unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace."2 Jehovah bless thee — is equal to "the love of God." Jehovah be *gracious* unto thee, answers to "the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ" — and Jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee 

and give thee peace, corresponds to "the communion of the Spirit." 

The divine doctrine of these holy and incomprehensible relations in the Divinity, is so inwrought and incorporated with all the parts of  the  sacred  books — so  identified  with  all  the  dispensations  of religion, and so essential to the mediatorship of Christ, that it is impossible  to  make  any  real  and  divine  proficiency  in  the  true knowledge  of  God — of  man — of  reconciliation — or  remission  of sins — of  eternal  life — or  in  the  piety  and  divine  life  of  Christ's religion — without a clear and distinct perception of it, as well as a firm and unshaken faith and confidence in it, as we trust still to make more evident in the sequel.

**2 Num 6:24-27.** 

6. Man as He Was 

The  original  man  was  the  rational  and  moral  ultimatum  of  the mundane system. Naturally, or as he came from God's hand, he was the perfection of all terrestrial creations and institutions. In the elements of his constitution, he was partly celestial and terrestrial, of an earthly material as to his body, but of a spiritual intelligence and a divine life. Made to know and to enjoy his Creator, and to have communion with all that is divine, spiritual, and material in the  whole  universe,  he  was  susceptible  of  an  almost  boundless variety of enjoyments. 

And God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in his own image created he him; a male and a female  created  he  them."  Gen  1:26-27.  Man,  then,  was  a companion of his Father and Creator, capable of admiring, adoring, and enjoying God. Having made the earth for him, God was fully glorified in all his sublunary works, when they made man happy, grateful, and thankful to himself. Man, then, in his natural state, was not merely an animal, but an intellectual, moral, pure, and holy being. 

His position or state in this creation, was that of a *lord tenant.* The earth is, indeed, the Lord's; but he gave it to man on a very easy and liberal lease; and so it became his property. He was, therefore, a free and responsible agent, capable of managing his estate and paying his rent; and consequently was susceptible of virtue and vice, of happiness and misery.  In order to  freedom,  virtue, and happiness, it was expedient and necessary to place him under a law; for where there is no law, there can be no liberty, virtue, or happiness. The law became a test of his character, a guarantee of his continued enjoyment of the life and property which God had leased to him on the condition of his obedience to that precept. 


That the temptation to disobedience might be weak, and the motive to obedience strong, single, and pure, the precept given here was simple, positive, and clear. It could not be a moral precept, because other reasons than simple submission to the will of his Lord and King might have co-operated and prevented the display of pure loyalty  by  which  his  character  was  to  be  tried  and  his  future fortunes governed. It was therefore a positive law. The requisition was  so  little  as  to  present  the  least  conceivable  restraint  upon liberty of thought and action, and yet it was the most infallible test of his loyalty. The Adamic constitution was therefore admirably designed and adapted to happiness. It placed only one restriction in the way of universal liberty, and that at such a distance as to make the circle of his free and unrestrained movements within a single step  of  the  last  outpost  of  all  intellectual,  moral,  and  sensible enjoyment. The whole earth was his to use, one single fruit alone excepted. Truly, God was superlatively good and kind to man in his peculiar condition and state. "Thou madest him a little lower than  the  angels,  and  hast  crowned  him  with  glory  and  honour. Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands. Thou hast put all things under his feet: — all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passes through the paths of the sea. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!" Psalm 8:5-9. 

"God  made  man  upright,  but  they  have  sought  out  many inventions." Adam rebelled. The natural man became preternatural. The animal triumphed over the human elements of his nature. Sin was born on earth. The crown fell from his head. The glory of the Lord departed from him. He felt his guilt, and trembled, he saw his nakedness and blushed. The bright candle of the Lord became a dimly  smoking  taper.  He  was  led  to  judgment.  He  was  tried, condemned to death, divested of his patrimonial inheritance, but respited  from  immediate  execution.  A  prisoner  of  death,  but permitted to roam abroad and at large till the King authorized his seizure and destruction. 

The stream of humanity, thus contaminated at its fountain, cannot in  this  world  ever  rise  of  itself,  to  its  primitive  purity  and excellence.  We  all  inherit  a  frail  constitution,  physically, intellectually, but especially morally frail and imbecile. We have all inherited our father's constitution and fortune: for Adam, we are told, after he fell "*begat a son in his own image,*" and that son was just  as  bad  as  any  other  son  ever  born  into  the  world:  for  he murdered his own dear brother, because he was a better man than himself. "Thus, by one man sin entered into the world, and death by that one sin, and so death, the wages of sin, has fallen upon all the offspring of Adam," because in him they have all sinned, or been made mortal — and consequently are born under condemnation to that death which fell upon our common progenitor, because of his transgression. 

In Adam, all have sinned; therefore "in Adam all die." Your nature, gentle reader, not your person, was in Adam when he put forth his hand to break the precept of Jehovah. You did not personally sin in that act; but your nature then in the person of your father, sinned against  the  Author  of  your  existence.  In  the  just  judgment, therefore, of your heavenly Father, your nature sinned in Adam, and  with  him  it is  right,  that  all  human  beings  should  be  born *mortal,* and that death should lord it over the whole race as he has 


done  in  innumerable  instances  even  "over  them  that  have  not sinned  after  the  similitude  of  Adam's  transgression;"  1: e.  by violating a positive law. Now it must be conceded, that what God can righteously and mercifully inflict upon a part of mankind, he may justly and mercifully inflict upon all; and therefore those that live one score or four score years on this earth, for the sin of their nature in Adam, might have been extinguished the first  year as reasonably as those who have in perfect infancy perished from the earth. Death is expressly denominated by an Apostle, "*the wages of sin.*" Now this reward of sin is at present inflicted upon at least *one fourth* of the human  race who have never violated any law, or sinned personally by any act of their lives. According to the most accurate  bills  of  mortality,  from  one  third  to  one  fourth  of  the whole progeny of man die in infancy, under two years, without the consciousness of good or evil. They are thus, innocent though they be,  as  respects  actual  and  personal  transgression,  accounted  as sinners by him who inflicts upon them the peculiar and appropriate wages of sin. This alarming and most strangely pregnant of all the facts  in  human  history,  proves  that  Adam  was  not  only  the common father, but the actual representative of all his children. 

There  is,  therefore,  a  sin  of  our  nature  as  well  as  personal transgression.  Some  inappositely  call  the  sin  of  our  nature  our "original sin;" as if the sin of Adam was the personal offence of his children. True, indeed, it is, our nature was corrupted by the fall of Adam before it was transmitted to us; and hence that hereditary imbecility to do good, and that proneness to do evil, so universally apparent in all human beings. Let no man open his mouth against the  transmission  of  a  moral  distemper,  until  he  satisfactorily explain  the  fact — that  the  special  characteristic  vices  of  parents appear in their children as much as the color of their skin, their hair,  or  the  contour  of  their  faces.  A  disease  in  the  moral constitution of a man is an clearly transmissible as any physical taint,  if  there  be  any  truth  in  history,  biography,  or  human observation. 

Still,  man,  with  all  his  hereditary  imbecility,  is  not  under  an invincible necessity to sin. Greatly prone to evil, easily seduced into  transgression,  he  may  or  may  not  yield  to  passion  and 

seduction.  Hence  the  differences  we  so  often  discover  in  the corruption and depravity of man. All inherit a *fallen,* consequently a *sinful* nature; though all are not equally depraved. Thus we find the  degrees  of  sinfulness  and  depravity  are  very  different  in different persons. And although without the knowledge of God and his  revealed  will,  without  the  interposition  of  a  mediator,  and without faith in him, "it is impossible to please God;" still, there are those who, while destitute of the knowledge and belief, are more noble and virtuous than others. Thus admits Luke when he says,  "The  Jews  in  Berea  were  more  noble  than  those  in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily whether these things were so. Therefore, many of them believed." Acts 17:11. But until man in his present preternatural state, believes the gospel report of his sins and submits to Jesus Christ as the only Mediator and Savior of sinners, it is impossible for him to do anything absolutely pleasing or acceptable to God. 

Condemned to natural death, and greatly fallen and depraved in our  whole  moral  constitution  though  we  certainly  are,  in consequence of the sin of Adam; still, because of the interposition of  the  second  Adam,  none  are  punished  with  everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, but those who actually and voluntarily sin against a dispensation of mercy under which they are placed: for this is "the condemnation of the world, that light has come into the world, and men *choose darkness* rather than light, because their deeds are evil." 

8. The Purposes of God Concerning Man 

   The universe issued from the goodness of God. Not to display his power and wisdom, but to give vent to his benignity, God created the heavens and the earth, and peopled them with all variety of being.  Infinite  wisdom  and  almighty  power  do  but  execute  the designs of eternal love. Goodness is the impulsive attribute which prompted all that the counsel and hand of the Lord have executed. The current of the universe all runs on the side of benevolence. "Abundant in goodness and truth," all God's designs are for the diffusion of bliss on the largest possible scale. Evil there is; but, under the benevolent administration of the Father of mercies, there will be as much good, with as little evil, as almighty power, guided by infinite wisdom, and goodness, can achieve. 

We  may  conjecture  much,  but  can  know  little  of  the  origin  of moral  evil  in  God's  dominion.  Its  history  on  earth  is  faithfully detailed in the Bible; and that, in the divine prudence, is all that is necessary to our successful warfare against its power, and blissful escape from its penal consequences. It is not necessary that we should analyze and comprehend the origin and nature of darkness in order to enjoy the light of the sun. The influences of light and darkness upon our system are quite sufficient, without any theory, to induce us to eschew the former, and delight in the latter. "By one  man  sin  entered  into  the  world,"  says  Paul;  and  "by  one tempter  sin  entered  into  man,"  says  Moses;  and  "lust  when  it conceives brings forth sin, and sin when it is perfected brings forth death," says James the Apostle, and these are the land-marks of our knowledge of the matter. 

To  limit  the  contagion  of  sin,  to  prevent  its  recurrence  in  any portion  of  the  universe,  and  to  save  sinners  from  its  ruinous consequences, are the godlike purposes of the common Father of all. The Gospel, or Christian system, is that only scheme which infinite  intelligence  and  almighty  love  could  devise  for  that benignant and gracious end. This purpose, like all God's purposes, is eternal and immutable. The scheme or theory was, therefore, not only arranged before the Jewish and patriarchal ages, but before the foundation of the world. 

The promises made to Eve, to Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, David,  etc.  are  positive  proofs  that  the  plan  was  laid  and  the purposes perfected before the world began. For why, we ask, could God promise the conquest of Satan by the son of Eve, the blessing of all nations, by the son of Abraham, etc. etc. if a scheme if this import  had  not  been  previously  established?  The  moment  that Adam, Eve, and the serpent were judged dates the first promise of a glorious conquest over our adversary by a descendant of Eve. That promise, and the consequent institution of sacrifice — the altar, the  victim,  and  the  priest,  are  ample  proofs  that  the  plan  was completed and a remedial system adopted antecedent to the trial of our first parents. 

But this is not to be inferred even from the premises clear and forcible as these are. It is expressly and repeatedly declared. Two things are evident as demonstration itself: — The first, — that all the *purposes* and *promises* of God are in Christ — in reference to him, and consummated in and by him; and, in the second place, they were all contemplated, covenanted, and systematized in him and through  him  *before  the  foundation  of  the  world.*  These  two propositions are so intimately connected, that they are generally asserted in the same portions of Scripture. For example: "He hath saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but  according to his  own purpose  and  grace which was given us *in* Christ Jesus before the world began; but is *now* made manifest  by  the  appearing  of  our  Savior  Jesus  Christ."  2  Tim. 1:9-10. Again, "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, in hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, *promised before the world began;* but has in due time manifested his word through preaching." Titus 1:1-16; Titus 2:1-15; Titus 3:1 "He has chosen us *in him before the foundation of the world,* that we should be holy and without blame before him in love." Eph. 1:4. Indeed, Jesus himself intimates that the whole affair of man's redemption, even to the preparation of the eternal  abodes  of the righteous, was arranged ere  time was born:  for,  in  his  own  parable  of  the  final  judgment,  he  says, "Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit a *kingdom prepared for you  from  the  foundation  of  the  world.*"  Matt.  25:34.  And  Peter settles the matter forever by assuring us that we "were redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was foreordained *before the foundation of the world.*" Christ, then, is the Lamb that was *foreordained,* and "slain from the foundation of the world." Therefore, says Jesus to his Father, speaking doubtless in contemplation of his work, "Thou lovedst  me  before  the  foundation  of  the  world;"  and  thus,  as Matthew  quotes  a  Prophet  speaking  of  him,  "he  uttered  things which had been kept secret from the foundation of the world." 

Evident then it is, that the whole remedial or gospel system was purposed, arranged, and established upon the basis of the revealed distinctions  of  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Spirit;  and  by  these,  in reference to one another, before the foundation of the world; and that  all  the  institutions  and  developments  of  religion  in  the different  ages  of  the  world,  were,  in  pursuance  of  that  system, devised in eternity, and consummated some two thousand years ago. 

Jesus of Nazareth, the promised Messiah, was elected, or rather was always the elect, the beloved of God, and appointed to be the foundation  of  the  new  creation.  "Behold,"  said  Jehovah,  seven centuries before his birth, "I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner, a sure foundation," called by Peter "an elect stone," though disallowed by the Jewish builders. Again, by the same Prophet he is called the elect of God: "Behold my servant whom I uphold, mine *elect* in whom my soul delights! I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles," etc. "He shall be for salvation to the ends of the earth." 

In consequence of these gracious purposes of God, the **Word** was made flesh, and dwelt among us — the Son of God was *sent* by his Father — became a Prophet, a High Priest, and a King over men, that he might be the mediator and administrator of an Institution of Grace. He became the righteous servant of Jehovah, a voluntary sacrifice for us — died, was buried, and rose again — ascended where he had been before — then, in union with his Father, sent the Holy Spirit, who proceeded forth from the presence and by the authority of the Father and the Son, to consummate the sanctification of his people. He is now placed upon the throne of God — head over all things to complete the triumphs of his cause — to lead many sons to glory — to raise the dead, judge the world, and revenge Satan and all that took part with him in his rebellion, whether angels or men — to create new heavens and a new earth, and to establish eternal peace, and love, and joy through all the new dominions which he shall have gained, and over which he shall have reigned: for he must reign till all his and our enemies shall have been subdued forever. Then he shall resign into the hands that gave him his empire, all that species of authority which he exercised in this great work of human deliverance. Then God himself, in his antecedent character and glory, as he reigned before sin was born and his administration began, shall preside over all things in all places for ever and ever. 

The present elect of God are, then, those who are *in Christ,* and not those out of him: for it was *in him* that God has set his affection upon them, and chose them to eternal life before the world began. God is not, indeed, in this whole affair a respecter of persons. It is at  character,  and  not  at  person,  that  God  looks.  He  has predestinated all that are in Christ "to be holy and without blame before him in love," and, at his coming, to be confirmed to him in all personal excellency and beauty, and to share with him the bliss of a glorious immortality. So that "we shall be like him" — he is the *first born,* and we his junior brethren, bearing his image in our persons as exactly as we now bear the image of the earthly Adam, the father of us all. 

In  all  these  gracious  purposes  of  God,  two  things  are  most remarkable: — First, that he has elected and called certain persons to high and responsible stations as parts of a grand system of practical philanthropy — such  as  Abraham,  Isaac,  Jacob,  Joseph,  Moses, Aaron, Joshua, David, Paul, etc. These were chosen and elevated not for their own sakes, so much as for public benefactors and blessings to the human race. It is not for its own sake that the eye is so beautiful, or performs the functions of vision; nor that the ear is so curiously fashioned, and performs the office of hearing; but for the general comfort and safety of the whole body. So stand in the family  of  God — in  the  body  of  Christ,  all  apostles,  prophets, preachers, reformers, and all specially called and chosen persons. As the Lord said to Saul of Tarsus, so may it be said of all those sons of oil — those elect ones — "I have appeared to you to make you a  minister  and  a  witness  for  me — to  send  you  to  the  Gentiles," etc. — *to make you a public benefactor.* Next to this remarkable fact is another still more remarkable; — that, according to the purposes of God in reference to the whole human race, things are so arranged and set in order, that all enjoyments shall be, as respects human agency, *conditional;* and that every man, in reference to spiritual and eternal blessings, shall certainly and infallibly have his own choice. Therefore, life and death,  good and evil, happiness  and misery, are placed before man as he now is, and he is commanded to make his own election and take his choice. Having chosen the good portion, he is then to "give all diligence to make his *calling* and *election* sure." 

**1 In the original the phrase in these two passage sis *pro chronoon aionoon,*  translated  sometimes  "*before  the  time  of ages*" — before the Jewish jubilees or ages began; and means that God's  purpose  to  call  the  Gentiles  was  antecedent  to  the covenants with Abraham and the Jews. Thus understood, it only proves that the purposes and promises of God in Christ were formed  and  expressed  before  the  days  of  Abraham.  But  it  is equally true as respects the beginning of time: for the phrase *pro* and  *apo  katabole  kosmou,*  found  *ten  times*  in  the  New Testament, literally indicates the foundation of the world. We quote Eph. 1:4. —  Matt. 25:34. — 1 Pe 1:19-20. — as unequivocally declarative of this.** 

9. Religion for Man, Not Man for Religion 

   Religion, as the term imports, began after the Fall; for it indicates a previous apostasy. A remedial system is for a diseased subject. The primitive man could love, wonder, and adore as angels now do, without religion; but man, fallen and apostate, needs religion in order to his restoration to the love, and worship, and enjoyment of God. Religion,  then, is  a system  of means of reconciliation — an institution for bringing man back to God — something to bind man anew to love and delight in God.1 

It consists of two departments; — the things that God has done for us,  and  the  things  that  we  must  do  for  ourselves.  The  whole proposition of necessity in this case, must come from the offended party.  Man  could  propose  nothing,  do  nothing  to  propitiate  his Creator,  after  he  had  rebelled  against  him.  Heaven,  therefore, overtures; and man accepts, surrenders, and returns to God. The Messiah is a gift, sacrifice is a gift, justification is a gift, the Holy Spirit is a gift, eternal life is a gift, and even the means of our personal sanctification is a gift from God. Truly, we are saved by *grace.*  Heaven,  we  say,  *does*  certain  things  for  us,  and  also *proposes* to us what we should do to inherit eternal life. It is all of God: for he has sent his Son; he has sent his Spirit; and all that they have done, or shall do, is of free favor; and the proposition concerning our justification and sanctification is equally divine and gracious as the mission of his Son. We are only asked to accept a sacrifice which God has provided for our sins, and then the pardon of them, and to open the doors of our hearts, that the Spirit of God may come in, and make its abode in us. God has provided all these blessings for us,  and only requires us to accept of them freely, without any price or idea of merit on our part. But he asks us to *receive* them cordially, and to give up our hearts to him. 

It is in the kingdom of grace, as in the kingdom of nature. Heaven provides the bread, the water, the fruits, the flowers; but we must gather and enjoy them. And if there be no merit in eating the bread which Heaven has sent for physical life and comfort, neither is there  merit  in  eating  the  bread  of  life  which  came  down  from heaven for our spiritual  life and consolation. Still, it  is true, in grace, as in nature — that he that eats shall not die. Hence, there are conditions of enjoyments, though no conditions of merit, either in nature or grace. We shall therefore speak in detail of *the things which God has done,* and of *the things that we must do,* as essential to our salvation. First, of the things that God has done: —  

**1  The  verb  *religio,*  with  all  its  Latin  family,  imports  a  *binding again,* or *tying fast* that which was dissolved.** 

10. Sacrifice for Sin 

The history of sacrifice is the history of atonement, reconciliation, redemption, and remission of sins. These are not, at least in the Jewish and Christian style, exactly synonymous terms. Sacrifice atones and reconciles. It propitiates God, and reconciles man. It is the cause, and these are its effects on heaven and earth, on God and man. 

For  form's  sake,  and  perhaps,  for  the  sake  of  perspicuity,  four questions ought here to be propounded and resolved, at the very threshold of our inquiries. 1. What *is* sacrifice? 2. *To whom* is it to be offered? 3. *For whom* is it to be offered? 4. *By whom* is it to be offered?  The  answers  are  as  prompt  and  as  brief  as  the interrogations. 1. In its literal primary acceptance, it is "*the solemn and religious infliction of death upon an innocent and unoffending victim, usually by shedding its blood.*" Figuratively, it means the offering of anything, living or dead, person or animal, or property, to God. 2. Religious sacrifice is to be offered to God alone. 3. It is to be offered for man. 4. It is to be offered by a priest. 

The greater part of sacrifices were lambs. Hence Christ is called the **Lamb of** **God**, not because of his innocence or patience, but because "he taketh away," or beareth "the sin of the world." It is rather, then, with a reference to his *death* than to his *life,* that he is called the *Lamb* of God. Neither his *example* nor his *doctrine* could expiate  sin.  This  required  the  shedding  of  blood:  for  without shedding of blood, there never was remission of sin. 

Priests are mediators in their proper place and meaning. But at first every man was his own priest. For as it was once right for a man to marry his sister, because he could find no other person for a wife, so was it lawful and expedient for every man to be his own priest. Thus, Adam, Abel, Noah, etc. were their own priests. In the next chapter of time, the eldest sons — then the princes of tribes, were priests  for  their  respective  tribes  and  people.  But  finally,  God called, and appointed such persons as Melchizedek and Aaron to those offices. 

Sacrifice, doubtless, is as old as the Fall. The institution of it is not recorded by Moses. But he informs us, that God had respect for Abel's offering, and accepted from him a *slain lamb.* Now had it been a human institution, this could not have been the case for a divine  warrant  has  always  been  essential  to  any  acceptable worship.  The question, "Who has  required this at  your hands?" must always be answered by a "*Thus saith the Lord,*" before an offering of mortal man can be acknowledged by the Lawgiver of the universe. "In vain," said the Great Teacher, "do you worship God,  teaching  for  doctrines  the  commandments  of  men."  God accepted the sacrifices of Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, etc. and in the Jewish system gave many laws and enactments concerning it. 

Now  as  sacrifice  may  be  contemplated  in  different  aspects,  in reference to what it is in itself, to whom it is tendered, for whom and by whom it is offered; so in each of these relations, it may be represented under different names. Hence, it is a "*sin offering,*" a 

*thank  offering,*  a  *propitiation,*1  a  *reconciliation,*  a  *redemption.* Contemplated in reference to God, it is a propitiation; in reference to mankind, it is a reconciliation; and in another point of view, it may even be regarded as a redemption or ransom. On each of these it may be expedient to make a few remarks. 

Sacrifice, as respects *God,* is a *propitiation;* as respects *sinners,* it is a *reconciliation;* as respects *sin,* it is an *expiation;* as respects the *saved,* it is a *redemption.* These are aspects of the thing of cardinal value in understanding the Scriptures. As a *propitiation* or atonement2  it  is  offered  to  God;  not,  indeed,  to  move  his benevolence or to excite his mercy, but to render him propitious *according to law and justice.* It sprang from everlasting love, and is the *effect* and not the *cause* of God's benevolence to sinners. But without it God could not be propitious to us. The indignity offered his person, authority, and government, by the rebellion of man, as also  the  good  of  all  his  creatures,  made  it  impossible  for  him, according  to  justice,  eternal  right,  and  his  own  benevolence,  to show mercy without sacrifice. True, indeed, he always does prefer mercy to sacrifice, as he prefers the end to the means. But divine mercy  forever  sits  upon  the  propitiatory;  upon  law  and  justice. Thus  affirms  Paul  of  Jesus,  "Whom  God  has  set  forth  as  a *propitiatory*  through  faith  in  his  blood,  for  a  declaration  of  his justice — that *he might be just,* and *the justifier of the ungodly,* or of him that believeth in Jesus." In this sense only, God could not be gracious  to  man  in  forgiving  him  without  a  propitiation,  or something that could justify him both to himself and all creatures. In this acceptation of the term *atonement,* it is found often in the law, not less than twenty-five times in the single book of Leviticus. 

As respects the sinner, we have said it is a *reconciliation.* Indeed, the  term  reconciliation  very  appropriately  applies  to  sacrifice, inasmuch as it brings forth the offended and the offender together. So far as it honors law and justice, it reconciles God to forgive; and so far as it displays to the offender love and mercy, it reconciles him to his offended Sovereign. It is, in this view, a reconciliation indeed.  It  propitiates  God  and  reconciles  man.  God's  "anger  is turned away;" (not a turbulent passion, not an implacable wrath); but  "*that  moral  sentiment  and  justice,*"  which  demands  the punishment of the violated law, is pacified or well pleased; and man's hatred and animosity against God, is subdued, overcome, and destroyed in and by the same sacrifice. Thus, in fact, it is, in reference to both parties, a reconciliation. Still, however, when we speak  according  to  scriptural  usage,  and  with  proper discrimination,  sacrifice,  as  respects  God,  is  atonement  or propitiation, and as respects man, it is reconciliation. These are its reasons and its effects. "For this cause," says Paul, "Jesus is the mediator  of  a  new  institution,  that  *by  means  of  death  for  the redemption of the transgressions* under the first institution, those who  have  been  called  might  receive  the  promise  of  the  eternal inheritance."3 Again, the same writer makes the death of Christ the 

basis of reconciliation, saying, "Be reconciled to God: for he has made Christ a sin offering for us;" and now "God is in Christ, reconciling the world to himself."4 

As respects sin, it has been observed, sacrifice is an *expiation.* The terms  purification  or  cleansing,  are  in  the  common  version preferred to *expiation.* Once, at least (Num 35:33,) we have a need of a better word to represent the original than the term *cleansing.* "There can be no expiation for the land" polluted with blood, "but by  the  blood  of  him  that  shed  it."  Still,  if  any  one  prefer *purification* to expiation, or even *cleansing* to either, so long as we understand  each  other,  it  is  indeed  a  matter  of  very  easy forbearance. The main point is, that sacrifice cancels sin, atones for sin,  and  puts  it  away.  "*He  put  away  sin,*"  says  Paul,  "*by  the sacrifice of himself.*" This is expiation. 

"The redemption, then, which is in Christ Jesus," is a *moral,* and not a *commercial* consideration. If sin were only a *debt,* and not a *crime,* it might be forgiven without atonement. Nay, if sin were a debt, and sacrifice a payment of that debt, then there could be no forgiveness at all with God! For if the Redeemer or Ransomer of man,  has  paid  the  debt,  justice,  and  not  mercy  or  forgiveness, commands the *release,* not the *pardon* of the debtor. Some there are, however, who from inattention of the sacred style, and the meaning of biblical terms, have actually represented the death of Christ,  rather  as  the  payment  of  an  immense  debt,  than  as  an expiation of sin, or a purification from guilt, and have thus made the  pardon  of  sin  wholly  unintelligible,  or  rather,  indeed, impossible. Every one feels, that when a third person assumes a debt, and pays it, the principal must be discharged, and cannot be forgiven.  But  when  sin  is  viewed  in  the  light  of  a  crime,  and atonement offered by a third person, then it is a question of grace, whether the pardon or acquittal of the sinner shall be granted by him against whom the crime has been committed; because, even after an atonement or propitiation is made, the transgressor is yet as deserving of punishment as before. There is room, then, for both justice and mercy; for the display of indignation against sin, and the  forgiveness  of  the  sinner,  in  just  views  of  sin,  and  of  the redemption there is in and through the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Redemption, however, is the *deliverance from sin,* rather than the expiation  or atonement for it. Thus, Christ is said  "by his  own blood,  to  have  obtained  an  eternal  redemption  for  us."5  Thus 

pardon, sanctification, and even the resurrection of the bodies of the saints, are severally contemplated as parts of our redemption, 

or deliverance from guilt to sin, from the power of sin, and from the punishment of sin.6 

There  is  a  number  of  incongruities  and  inaccuracies  in  the controversy about the nature and extent of the atonement, which, as the mists of the morning retire from the hills before the rising sun,  disappear  from  out  mental  horizon,  when  the  light  of scriptural definition breaks in upon our souls. The atonement or propitiation  has  no "*extent,*" because God alone is  its  object.  It contemplates sin as a unit in the divine government, and therefore the "*Lamb of God* beareth away the sin of the world," and his death is a "*sin offering.*" As to its value, it is unspeakable. Commensurate it is, indeed, with the sin of the world; for it makes it just on the part of God, to forgive and save every one that believeth in Jesus. Reconciliation and redemption, have, however, a certain limited extent.  Reconciliation  is  not  universal,  but  partial.  All  do  not believe in Jesus, all are therefore not reconciled to God through him. Redemption, or deliverance from the guilt, pollution, power, and punishment of sin,  is  only  commensurate  with  the elect  of God, 1: e. with those who believe in Jesus and obey him. 

They who affirm that one drop of Christ's blood could expiate the sin of the whole world, teach without knowing it, that Christ has died in vain: for, surely, the Messiah might have shed many drops of blood and still have lived. They make his death an unmeaning superfluity  or  redundancy,  who  reason  thus.  They  also  agree, without intending it, with those who view sin merely as a debt, and not a crime, and therefore say that there is no need of sin offerings, or sacrifice, or of a divine Savior, in order to its forgiveness. 

They, too, seem to mistake the matter, and I am sorry to find such names among them as Butler, Whitby, and Macknight, who, while they  contend,  that  the  death  of  Christ,  was  a  sacrifice  or  a propitiation  for  sin,  wholly  resolve  its  efficacy  into  the  mere appointment of God. According to them, God might have saved the whole world without the appearance of his Son: for the merits or efficacy of Christ's death arises not from his dignity of person, but from the mere appointment or will of God! Now we cannot think that it was possible for God himself to save sinners in any other way than he has  chosen:  for to  have paid  an  overprice for our redemption, savors rather of prodigality. than of divine wisdom and prudence. And if mere appointment was sufficient, why not, then, have continued the legal sacrifices, and have made the blood of bulls and of goats efficacious to take it away?! 

To  conclude,  sacrifice  is  essential  to  remission  of  sins,  and  is therefore old as the fall of man. But the sacrifices of the patriarchal and Jewish dispensations could not, and did not, take away sin. They were but types of the real sacrifice: for as Paul says, "It was not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sin." And again, "If the blood of bulls, and of goats, with the ashes of a heifer, did cleanse to the purification of the flesh; how much more shall  *the  blood  of  Christ,*  who  through  an  eternal  spirit  offers himself to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" Christ's death is, therefore, a real and sufficient sacrifice  for  sin,  and  stands  in  the  attitudes  of  *propitiation, reconciliation, expiation,* and *redemption;* from which spring to us, justification, sanctification, adoption, and eternal life.  

The sacrifice of Christ, as before affirmed, is, as respects God, a propitiation; as respects man, a reconciliation; as respects sin, an expiation; as respects the penitent, a redemption; but the attributes that apply to it in any of these aspects do not apply to it in the others;  and  this  oversight  has  in  our  opinion  been  the  fruitful source of interminable controversies concerning the "atonement," as it is most usually denominated. It is indeed, *infinite* in value, as respects  the  expiation  of  sin,  or  its  propitiatory  power;  but  as respects the actual reconciliation and redemption of sinners, it is limited to those only who believe on and obey the Savior. While, also, it is as universal as the sin of the world, the peculiar sins only of the obedient are expiated by it. Its *design,* then, is necessarily limited to all who come to God by it; while its value and efficacy, are equal to the salvation of the whole world, provided only, they will put themselves under the covering of its propitiatory power. 

The "doctrine of the cross" being the great central doctrine of the Bible, and the very essence of Christianity — which explains all the peculiarities of the Christian system, and of the relation of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as far as mortals can comprehend them, and as  it  has  been  to  sceptics  and  to  many  professors,  "a  stone  of stumbling, and a rock of offence," for the sake of some of the speculative  and  cavilling,  who  ask  *why  are  these  things  so,*  I subjoin an extract from the writings of Mr. Watson, on this point, which may suggest to them some useful reflections on this cardinal and all absorbing subject: —  

"How sin may be forgiven,” says Mr. Watson, “without leading to such misconceptions of the divine character as would encourage disobedience,  and  thereby  weaken  the  influence  of  the  divine government,  must  be  considered  as  a  problem  of  very  difficult solution. A government which admitted no forgiveness, would sink the guilty in despair; a government which never punishes offence, is a contradiction, it cannot exist. Not to punish the guilty, is to dissolve  authority;  to  punish  without  mercy,  is  to  destroy,  and where all are guilty, to make the destruction universal. That we cannot sin with impunity, is a matter determined. The Ruler of the world is not careless of the conduct of his creatures; for that penal consequences  are  attached  to  the  offence,  is  not  a  subject  of argument, but it is matter of fact, evident by daily observation of the events and circumstances of the present life. It is a principle, therefore, already laid down, that the authority of God must be preserved;  but  it  ought  to  be  remarked,  that  in  that  kind  of administration  which  restrains  evil  by  penalty,  and  encourages obedience by favor and hope, we and all moral creatures are the interested parties, and not  the Divine Governor himself, whom, because  of  his  independent  and  all  sufficient  nature,  our transgressions cannot injure. The reasons, therefore, which compel him to maintain his authority, do not terminate in himself. If he treats offenders with severity, it is for our sake, and for the sake of the moral order of the universe, to which sin, if encouraged by a negligent administration, or by entire and frequent impunity, would be the source of endless disorder and misery; and if the granting of pardon to offence be strongly and even severely guarded, so that no less a satisfaction could be accepted than the death of God's own Son, we are to refer to the moral necessity of the case, as arising out of the general welfare of accountable creatures, liable to the deep evil of sin, and not to any reluctance on the part of our Maker to forgive, much less to anything vindictive in his nature, charges which have been most inconsiderately and unfairly said to be implied in the doctrine of Christ's sacrificial sufferings. If it then  be  true,  that  the  release  of  offending  man  from  future punishment, and his restoration to the divine favor, ought, for the interest of mankind themselves, and for the instruction and caution of other beings, to be so bestowed, that no license shall be given to offence;  that  God  himself,  while  he  manifests  his  compassion, should not appear less just, less holy than he really is; that his authority should be felt to be as compelling, and that disobedience should  as  truly,  though  not  unconditionally,  subject  us  to  the deserved  penalty,  as  though  no  hope  of  forgiveness  had  been exhibited; — we ask, On what scheme, save that which is developed in  the  New  Testament,  are  those  necessary  conditions  provided for? Necessary they are, unless we contend for a license and an impunity which shall annul all good government in the universe, a point for which no reasonable man will contend; and if so, then we must allow, that there is strong internal evidence of the truth of the doctrine  of  Scripture,  when  it  makes  the  offer  of  pardon consequent only upon the securities we have mentioned. If it be said,  that  sin  may  be  pardoned,  in  the  exercise  of  the  divine prerogative, the  reply is, that if this  prerogative were  exercised towards a part of mankind only, the passing by of the rest would be with difficulty reconciled to the Divine character; and if the benefit were extended to all, government, would be at an end. This scheme of bringing men within the exercise of a merciful prerogative, does not, therefore, meet the obvious difficulty of the case; nor is it improved by confining the act of grace only to repentant criminals. For if repentance imply a "renewal in the spirit of the mind," no criminal  would of himself thus  repent.  But  if  by repentance be meant merely remorse and terror, in the immediate view of danger, what offender, surrounded with the wreck of former enjoyments, feeling  the  vanity  of  guilty  pleasures,  now  past  forever,  and beholding the approach of the delayed penal visitation, but would repent?  Were  the  principle  of  granting  pardon  to  repentance  to regulate human  governments,  every  criminal  would escape, and judicial  forms  would  become  a  subject  of  ridicule.  Nor  is  it recognized  by  the  Divine  Being,  in  his  conduct  to  men  in  the present state, although in this world punishments are not final and 

The question proposed abstractedly, How may mercy be extended to  offending  creatures,  the  subjects  of  the  divine  government, without  encouraging  vice  by  lowering  the  righteous  and  holy character  of  God,  and  the  authority  of  his  government  in  the maintenance of which the whole universe of beings are interested? is, therefore, at once one of the most important, and one of the most  difficult  that  can  employ  the  human  mind.  None  of  the theories  which  have  been  opposed  to  Christianity  affords  a satisfactory solution of the problem. They assume principles either destructive  of  moral  government,  or  which  cannot,  in  the circumstances of man be acted upon. The only answer is found in the  holy  Scriptures.  They  alone  show,  and  indeed,  they  alone profess to show, how God may be "just," and yet the "justifier" of the ungodly. Other schemes show how he may be merciful; but the difficulty does not lie there. The gospel meets it, by declaring "the righteousness  of  God,"  at  the  same  time  that  it  proclaims  his mercy. The voluntary sufferings of the divine Son of God, "for us," "the just for the unjust," magnify the justice of God; display his hatred to sin; proclaim "the exceeding sinfulness" of transgression, by the deep and painful manner in which they were inflicted upon the Substitute; warn the persevering offender of the terribleness, as well as the certainty, of his  punishment; and open the gates of salvation to every penitent. It is a part of the same divine plan, also,  to  engage  the  influence  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  to  awaken penitence in man, and to lead the wanderer back to himself; to renew our fallen nature in righteousness, at the moment we are justified through faith, and to place us in circumstances in which we may henceforth "walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." All the ends of government are here answered — no license is given to offence — the moral law is unrepealed — a day of judgment is still appointed — future and eternal judgments still display their awful sanctions — a new and singular display of the awful purity of the divine character is afforded — yet pardon is offered to all who seek it; and the whole world may be saved. 

With such evidence of the suitableness to the case of mankind, under such lofty views of connection with the principles and ends of moral government, does the doctrine of the atonement present itself. But other important considerations are not wanting to mark the  united  wisdom  and  goodness  of  that  method  of  extending mercy to the guilty, which Christianity teaches us to have been actually and exclusively adopted. It is rendered, indeed, "worthy of all acceptation," by the circumstance of its meeting the difficulties we have just dwelt upon — difficulties which could not otherwise have  failed  to  make  a  gloomy  impression  upon  every  offender awakened to a sense of his spiritual danger; but it must be very inattentively considered, if it does not further commend itself to us, by not only removing the apprehensions we might feel as to the severity of the Divine Lawgiver, but as exalting him in our esteem, as  "the  righteous  Lord,  who  loveth  righteousness,"  who surrendered  his  beloved  Son  to  suffering  and  death,  that  the influence of moral goodness might not be weakened in the hearts of his creatures; and as a God of love, affording in this instance a view of the tenderness and benignity of his nature, infinitely more impressive  and  affecting,  than  any  abstract  description  could convey; or than any act of creating or providential power and grace could exhibit, and, therefore most suitable to subdue that enmity which had unnaturally grown up in the hearts of his creatures, and which,  when  corrupt,  they  so  easily  transfer  from  a  law  which restrains  their  inclination,  to  the  Lawgiver  himself.  If  it  be important to us to know the extent and reality of our danger, by the death of Christ it is displayed, not in description, but in the most impressive  action;  if  it  be  important  that  we  should  have  an assurance of the divine placibility toward us, it  here receives  a demonstration incapable of being heightened; if gratitude be the most powerful motive of future obedience, and one which renders command on the one part, and active service on the other, "not grievous, but joyous," the recollection of such obligations as those which the "love of Christ" has laid us under, is a perpetual spring to this energetic affection, and will be the means of raising it to higher  and  more  delightful  activity  forever.  All  that  can  most powerfully illustrate the united tenderness and awful majesty of God, and the odiousness of sin; all that can win back the heart of man to his Maker and Lord, and render future obedience a matter of affection and delight, as well as duty; all that can extinguish the angry and malignant passions of man to man; all that can inspire a mutual benevolence, and dispose to a self-denying charity for the benefit of others; all that can arouse by hope, or tranquilize by faith,  is  to  be  found  in  the  sacrificial  death  of  Christ,  and  the principles and purposes for which it was endured." 

**1 The Hebrew term translated in the Greek Old Testament, of the *ilasmsos,*  and  in  the  common  English  version,  *atonement*  or propitiation, is *copher,* which signifies a *covering.* The verb** COPHER **"to  *cover,*"  or  "to  *make  atonement*"  denotes  the  object  of sacrifice;  and  hence,  Jesus  is  called  the  *ilasmos,*  the  covering, propitiation or atonement for our sins. 1 Jn 2:2; 1 Jn 4:10. It is a curious and remarkable fact, that God covered Adam and Eve with the skins of the first victims of death, instead of their *fig leaf* robes. This may have prefigured the fact, that while sin was atoned or expiated as respects God by the life of the victim, the effect  as  respects  man  was  a  covering  for  his  nakedness  and shame, or his sin, which divested him of his primitive innocence and beauty, and covered him with ignominy and reproach.**  

**2 *Kattallagee,* translated once *atonement;* Rom. 5:11, occurs in the New Testament *four times.* In Rom. 5:11, it ought to have been  *reconciliation,*  as  in  Rom.  11:15,  2  Co  5:18-19.  It  is  not *ilasmos,  atonement,*  in  the  Jewish  sense,  but  *katallagee, reconciliation.*  God  receives  the  atonement,  and  men  the reconciliation. It is preposterous, then, to talk to the extent of the atonement, but not so of the reconciliation.**

11. The Attributes of a True Sin-Offering 

    A single action or event often involves, in weal or woe, a family, a nation, an empire. Who can count the effects or bearings of the elevation  or  fall  of  a  Cesar,  a  Hannibal,  a  Napoleon?  A  single victory, like that of Zama, or of Waterloo; a single revolution, like that of England, or America, sometimes involves the fortunes of a world. Neither actions nor events can be appreciated but through their bearings and tendencies upon every person and thing with which they come in contact. The relations, connections, and critical dependencies  in  which  persons  and  actions  stand  are  often  so numerous and so various, that it is seldom, or perhaps, at all, in the power of man to calculate the consequences, or the value of one of a thousand of the more prominent actions of his life. 

Who could have estimated, or who can estimate, the moral or the political bearings of the sale of Joseph to a band of Ishmaelites — of the exposure of Moses in a cradle of rushes on the Nile — of the anointing  of  David  king  of  Israel — of  the  schism  of  the  twelve tribes under Rehoboam — of the treachery of Judas, the martyrdom of Stephen, the conversion of Paul, the accession of Constantine the Great, the apostasy of Julian, the crusades against the Turks, the reformation of Luther, the revival of letters, or any of the great movements of the present day? How difficult, then, is it to estimate the rebellion of Satan, the fall of Adam, the death of Christ, in all their bearings upon the destinies of the universe! 

Before a remedy for sin could either be devised or appreciated a knowledge  of  its  bearings  upon  God  and  man,  upon  time  and eternity, upon heaven and earth, is an indispensable prerequisite. But who possesses this knowledge, or what uninspired man can attain  it?  At  best  we  know  but  in  part;  and,  therefore,  can  but partially  explain  anything.  How  difficult,  then,  to  form  a satisfactory view of sin and its remedy — of the fall of Adam and the death of Christ! 

It  would,  however,  greatly  aid  our  conceptions  of  the  death  of Christ, and illustrate the nature and use of *sin-offerings,* could we obtain  just  and  scriptural  views  of  sin  in  its  necessary consequences,  or  in  its  prominent  bearings  upon  the  universe. Indeed, some knowledge of these aspects of sin is essential to our perception and appreciation of the wisdom, justice, and grace of the Christian system. It is not enough that we entertain a few vague and indistinct notions of its tendencies, or of the attitudes in which it stands to God, ourselves, and our fellows: we must have clear and definite views of the relations in which God stands to us, and we to him and to one another, and how sin affects us all in these relations: for that it bears a peculiar aspect to each of us in all these relations will, we doubt not, be conceded without debate. 

God  stands  in  diverse  relations  to  the  intellectual  and  moral creation. He is our Father, our Lawgiver, and our King. Now his feelings as a father, and his character as a lawgiver and sovereign, are  equally  involved  in  the  bearings  and  aspects  of  sin.  The influence of sin upon ourselves is also various and multiform. It affects the heart the conscience, the whole soul and body of man. It alienates our affections, and even works hatred to our minds both towards God and man. As an ancient adage says, "We hate those we have injured;" and having offended God our Father, we are, for that very reason, filled with enmity against him. It also oppresses and pollutes the conscience with its guilt and dread, and enslaves the passions as well as works the destruction of the body. It also alienates man from man, weakens the authority and destroys the utility of the law; and, if not subdued, would ultimately subvert the throne and government of God. If not restrained and put down, it would fill the universe with anarchy and disorder — with universal misery and ruin. 

To go no farther into details, it may, on the premises already before us, be observed: — 1st. That every sin wounds the affection of our heavenly Father — 2d. Insults and dishonors his law and authority in the estimation of his other subjects — 3d. Alienates our hearts from him — 4th.  Oppresses  our  conscience  with  guilt  and  dread — 5th. Severs us from society by its morbid selfishness and disregard for man — 5th.  Induces  to  new  infractions  and  habitual  violations  of right — And, 7th. Subjects us to shame and contempt — our bodies to the  dust,  and  our  persons  to  everlasting  destruction  from  the presence of the Lord. 

Not as the full tale, but rather as a specimen of the loss sustained, and  of  the  mischief  done,  by  our  transgression,  we  have  made these seven specifications. These only serve to show in how many aspects  sin  must  be  contemplated  before  we  can  form  a  just estimate of a suitable and sufficient sin offering or remedy. 

Now,  so  far  as  we  have  been  able  to  trace  the  tendencies  and bearings of transgression in the above enumeration, we must find in the *sin offering* a remedy and an antidote which will fully meet all  these  aspects;  otherwise  it  will  be  utterly  valueless  and unavailing  in  the  eye  of  enlightened  reason,  as  well  as  in  the righteous judgment of God, to expiate sins, to put it away, and to prevent its recurrence. 

Need, we demonstrate that man himself cannot furnish such a sin offering! Need we again propound Micah's question — "Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? Shall I come before him, with burnt offerings; with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands  of  river  of  oil?  Shall  I  give  my  first  born  for  my transgression; the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul." Will repentance for the past, and future amendment place things as they were; raise the murdered dead; repair wasted fortunes, and recruit broken constitutions? Will tears, and groans, and agonies, honor a violated law, sustain a righteous government, vindicate the Divine character, and prevent future and further enormities? Have the ever done it? Can they ever do it? Surely, we shall be excused for not attempting to prove that we have neither a tear, nor a sigh, nor an agony, nor a lamb, nor a kid of our own creation, to offer to the Lord, even were such a sacrifice available to meet all the bearings of the case! 

Every transgression, even the least, the eating of a forbidden apple, subjects the transgressor to destruction. One sin, of one man, has involved the whole race in death. The life of the transgressor is demanded in the very mildest accents of insulted justice. Hence, in the law of the typical sin offerings, we find it thus written: "The *life* of the flesh is in the *blood:* and I have given it to you upon the altar, to make an atonement for your souls: **for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.**"1 But such blood, such lives as  the  law  required  could  not,  Paul  and  Common  Sense  being judge, take away sin. They could only prefigure a *life* and a *blood* that could  truly, and justly, and honorably  expiate it. Thus,  *the death of Christ* is forced upon our attention by the law, by the prophets, by the necessity of the case, enlightened Reason being in the chair, as the only real, true, and proper sin-atoning offering. It does, indeed, meet not only the above seven particulars, but all others which have occurred to the human mind; and thus secures the union and harmony of things on earth, and of things in heaven, in the inviolable bonds of an everlasting brotherhood. 

1. "In bringing many sons to glory," it soothes and delights the wounded love of our kind and benignant heavenly Father— 
1. "It  magnifies  and  makes  honorable"  his  violated  law  and insulted government— 
1. It reconciles our hearts thoroughly and forever to God, as a proof  and  pledge  incontrovertible  of  his  wonderful  and incomprehensible love to us— 
1. It effectually relieves our conscience by "cleansing us from all sin," and produces within us a divine serenity, a peace and joy "unspeakable and full of glory"— 
1. It also reconciles us to our fellows, and fills us with brotherly affection and universal benevolence, because it makes us all one in faith, in hope, in joy, as joint heirs of immortality and eternal life— 
1. It is the most effectual guard against new infractions of the divine law, and superlatively deters from sin, by opening to us its diabolical nature and tremendous consequences; showing us in the person of God's only begotten and well beloved Son, when a sin offering, the impossibility of escape, from the just and  retributive  punishment  of  insulted  and  indignant Heaven — and  
7. It is a ransom from death, a redemption from the grave, such a deliverance from the guilt, pollution, power, and punishment of sin,  as  greatly  elevates  the sons  of God above all that they could have attained or enjoyed under the first constitution. It presents a new creation to our view; — new heavens, new earth, new  bodies,  new  life,  new  joys,  new  glories.  He  that vanquished death by dying, who now sits upon the throne says, "Behold, I make all things new." "He has become the Author of an eternal salvation to all that obey him." 

Let no one imagine that in this exemplification of the aspects in which sin and sin offerings must be contemplated before we can rationally  judge  of  the  necessity,  the  suitableness,  and  the sufficiency of the death of Christ, we have attempted to present a full view of these aspects. We are incompetent to the task. The life is  too  short,  and  our  opportunities  too  limited,  to  learn  all  the bearings  of  transgression  upon  ourselves,  the  throne  and government  of  God,  and  his  other  subjects.  We  only  intend  a specimen of the points to be met in a proper sin offering. These put it  out  of  the  reach  of  all  human,  of  all  angelic,  of  all  created mediators, victims, or sacrifices to expiate sin. So far as we can comprehend this wonderful subject, we are more and more deeply penetrated  with  the  conviction,  that  nothing  inferior  to  the voluntary sacrifice of the Son of God, could put away sin; and make it both just, and merciful, and honorable, and safe, on the part of his God and Father, to forgive and save one of his rebel race.  Nor  would  it  then  have  been  just,  according  to  our conception, to  have compelled him to bear our iniquities, or to suffer the just for the unjust; to inflict on an innocent person, the chastisement of our offences; but it was both just and kind on the part  of  our  heavenly  Father,  to  accept  for  us  the  voluntary surrender of his Son, as a willing sacrifice for our sins. "Thanks be to God, for his unspeakable gift!" 

**1 Lev. 17: 11.** 

12. Christ: the Light of the World 

As Abraham said to Isaac on his way to Mount Moriah, "God," my son, "will provide himself a lamb for the burnt offering," so has it come to pass. In order to the redemption of man from sin and all its penal consequences, God has provided a lamb, for a sin offering. He sent his Son, who on coming into the world, said, "Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me; in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sins thou has had no pleasure; then said I, Lo, I come to do thy will, in the volume of the book it is  written of me." But  he did  more than offer himself as a sin offering; he was more than the Lamb of God; he was the "prophet of Jehovah," and revealed to man the character and the will of God. He disclosed secrets hid from the foundation of the world. In one word, he is **the oracle**, as well as the **sacrifice** which God had provided for us. 

As the **Incarnate** **Word**, he is the interpreter of his will. The New Testament  is  then,  the  gift  of  Christ — and  was  written  by  his guidance and inspiration. For all that the Spirit of God has done has been through his  instrumentality. The Spirit  is  Christ's gift. Jesus is now as much "Lord of the Spirit" as he is the Lord of life and glory. The New Testament is a volume written by his servants. Six of his Apostles and two of his Evangelists wrote it all. That book is to us now in the stead of the personal presence of the Lord and his Apostles. He gave gifts to men after he left their abode. "He gave Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers." As a means of our salvation; as one of the things which God has done for us, we place the New Testament, the living oracles, or gospel of Christ, as next in order, as it is in importance, to his sacrifice. 

To the sacrifice of Christ,  we always  look  for  the basis of our pardon; to his blood that cleanses from all sin, for justification and personal  acceptance;  and  to  his  Word  we  look  for  counsel  and instruction  in  Christian  piety  and  righteousness.  We  are  as dependent on his  *Word* for light, as we are upon his  *blood* for pardon. "I am," said he, "**the light of the world**; he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the *light of life.*" "In him was life, and the life was the light of men." "That was the true light," said John, "which coming into the world, enlighteneth every man." "As long as I am in the world," says Jesus, "I am the light of the world." Thus Isaiah spake of him: "I will also give thee as a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation to the ends of the earth." "I will give thee for a covenant of the people, or light of the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison; and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house." "His going forth is prepared as the morning." "The sun of righteousness will arise with healing under his wings." "I witness," said Paul, "both to small and great, that the Messiah should show light to the people and to the Gentiles." The Word of Christ, is the light of Christ; and therefore the Christian Scriptures are the light of the world; and he that followeth them shall have the light of life. "If  you  continue  in  my  doctrine,"  says  the  Messiah,  "you  shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." "If the Son make you free, you shall be free indeed." 

13: The Lordship of the Messiah 

We are seeking to apprehend *the things done for us* in the Christian system. "Christ, our passover, has been sacrificed for us." As such, "not a bone was broken." Yet, "he died for us." In the second place, he has become our *prophet,* as well as our *priest;* and has declared to us the will of God; the whole will of God concerning us. He is our *light,* as well as our *sin offering.* But in the third place, he has been made *Lord* for us. To make Christ Lord *for* us, as well as *of* us — was the last act of the sublime drama of man's redemption from sin.  The  last  secret  of  the  mystery  of  Christ,  which  Peter promulged  on  the  day  of  Pentecost,  was,  "Let  all  the  house  of Israel  know,  that  God  has  made  that  same  Jesus,  whom  you crucified, both **Lord** and **Christ**." To make him Lord for us, was to invest him with *universal authority,* that he might have it in his power to give eternal life to all his people. Jesus, in one of his prayers, in anticipation of his investiture, says, "Thou hast given him *power over all flesh* that he might give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him." But after his resurrection from the dead, and ascension into heaven, he was crowned Lord of angels, as well as Lord of men; and therefore he said, "all authority," or lordship, "in heaven and on earth is given to me." He is now the **Lord of hosts**:  legions  of  angels,  the  armies  of  the  skies,  are  given  to him: — for what? That he might be able to do all for us that our condition  needs.  It  was  *for  us*  he  became  a  Prophet,  *for  us*  he became a priest, *for us* he has been made Lord of hosts, King of the universe, Judge and avenger of all. He is Lord of life, Lord of the Spirit, Lord of all. 

We  need  sacrifice — and  therefore  we  need  a  priest.  We  need  a Leader, a Luminary, a Sun of Righteousness; and we want one who can always help us in time of need, when we wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with the rulers of the darkness of this world; with wicked spirits living in the air. In Jesus himself, in one of the conflicts, needed an angel to minister to him, we need it more. Three things are done for us; a sin offering is presented; a lamp of life is put into our hands; and all the active powers and energies in the  wide  universe  are  placed  at  the  command  of  our  King whenever we need them. These are things already done. Hence, the Holy Spirit, and all the angels of heaven are now at the disposal of our Savior: for in him all the promises of God are laid up; all the treasures  of  wisdom  and  knowledge,  and  all  the  fulness  of  the Deity, reside fully and truly in him. All these things, it is true, might  be  comprehended  in  one  gift — the  gift  of  Jesus  as  our Mediator; our Prophet,  Priest,  and King. Still it  is  expedient to view  the  things  done  for  us,  severally  and  distinctly  in  the Christian system.  

Other things are promised  *to  be done*  for us:  but  these are the things already done for us, and before we shall speak of the things yet to be done for us, and done in us, we shall summarily consider the things to be done by us, before anything more can be done for us, or done in us. 

14. Faith in Christ 

The things done for us will truly be to us as though they were not, unless they are believed. Hence, to the untutored and unbelieving barbarian or infidel, the universe is without a sin offering, a Sun of Righteousness,  a  Lord,  Redeemer,  and  a  Holy  Spirit.  Faith  is necessary only as a means of attainment; as a means of enjoyment. It is not, then, an arbitrary enactment or requisition, but a gracious means of salvation. 

Faith in Christ is the effect of belief. Belief is the *cause;* and trust, confidence, or faith *in* Christ, the *effect.* "*The faith,*" sometimes means *the truth* to be believed. Sometimes it means "*the belief of the  truth;*"  but  here  we  speak  of  it  metonymically,  putting  the effect for the cause — or calling the effect by the name of the cause. To believe what a person says, and to trust in him are not always identical. True, indeed, they often are; for if a person speaks to us concerning himself, and states to us matters of great interest to ourselves, requiring confidence in him, to believe what he says, and to believe or trust *in* him, are in effect, one and the same thing. Suppose a physician present himself to one that is sick, stating his ability and willingness to heal him; to believe is to trust in him, and to put ourselves under his guidance; provided, only, we love health rather than sickness, and life rather than death. 

While, then, faith is the simple belief of testimony, or of the truth, and never can be more nor less than that; as a *principle of action* it has respect to a person or thing interesting to us: and is confidence or trust in that person or thing. Now the belief of what Christ says of himself, terminates in trust or confidence in him: and as the Christian religion is a personal thing, both as respects *subject* and *object,* that faith in Christ which is essential to salvation is not the belief of any doctrine, testimony, or truth, abstractly, but belief *in* Christ; trust or confidence in him as a person, not a thing.1 We take Paul's definition of the term and of the thing, as perfectly simple, intelligible, and sufficient. For the term faith, he substitutes  *the belief of the truth.* "God has from the beginning chosen  you to 

salvation, through the sanctification of the spirit; through the belief of the truth."2 And of the thing, he says, "Faith is the *confidence* of 

things hoped for, the *conviction* of things not seen."3 And John says, it is "receiving testimony," for "If we receive the testimony of man," as a principle of action, or put trust in it, "the testimony of 

God is greater," and of course will produce greater confidence.4 Any belief, then, that does not terminate in our personal confidence in Jesus as the Christ, and to induce trustful submission to him, is not faith unfeigned; but a dead faith, and cannot save the soul. 

**1  See  the  Essay  on the  Foundation  of  Christian  Union,  on the terms *fact, testimony, faith, etc.* where this subject is treated at large.**  

**2 2 Th 2:13.  3 Heb. 11:1.  4 1 Jn 5:9.** 

15. Repentance 

Repentance is an effect of faith: for who that believes not that God exists, can have "repentance towards God"? Repentance is sorrow for sins committed; but it is more.  It  is  a resolution  to forsake them; but it is more. It is actual "ceasing to do evil, and learning to do well." This is "*repentance unto life,*" or what is truly called *reformation.* Such is the force of the command, "*Repent every one of you.*" It is not merely, Be sorry for what you have done wrong; nor is it, Resolve to do better; nor even, Try to amend your ways: but it is actual amendment of life from the views and the motives which  the  gospel  of  Christ  exhibits.  Gospel  repentance  is  the offspring of gospel light and gospel motive, and therefore, it is the effect, and not the cause, of belief of the testimony of God.  

True  repentance  is,  then,  always  consummated  in  actual reformation of life. It therefore carries in its very essence, the idea of restitution. For no man can cordially disallow or reprobate his sinful course of life, who does not redress the wrongs he has done to  the  utmost  limit  of  his  power.  To  God,  he  can  make  no restitution,  only  as  he  refunds  to  his  creatures,  whom  he  has injured. If, then, any one is convinced in his own mind, that he has injured the person, the character, or the property of his neighbor, by word or deed, and has it in his power, by word or deed, to undo the evil he has done, or to restore what he has unjustly taken away, he will certainly do it, if his repentance be according to either the law of Moses or the Gospel of Christ. Otherwise his repentance is of no value: for God cannot, without trampling on his own law, and  dishonoring  his  own  character,  forgive  any  man  who  is conscious of any sin he has done to any man, unless to the utmost extent of his power, he make good the injury he has done. Thus saith the Lord, "If a soul sin and commit a trespass against the Lord, and lie unto his neighbor in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, (i. e. trading,) or in anything taken away by violence, or has deceived his neighbor, or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, or sweareth falsely; in any or all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: Then it shall be, because he hath sinned and is guilty, that he shall *restore* that which he took violently away, or the thing which he has *deceitfully gotten,* or that which was delivered him to keep, or that lost thing which he found, or all that about which he has sworn falsely, he shall even restore it in the *principal,* and shall add a fifth part more thereto, and give it to him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering, and he shall bring his trespass offering to the Lord, and the priest shall  make  atonement  for  him  before  the  Lord,  and  it  shall  be forgiven him." Levit. 6: 1-7. Sin offerings without repentance, and repentance  without  sin  offerings,  are  equally  ineffectual  before God. We sin against God always, when we sin against man; and therefore,  after making  all things  right with  man, we can only, through sacrifice, which makes the matter right with God, obtain forgiveness. To the same effect, Jesus speaks, Matt. 5:23-24, "Be reconciled to your brother," first make the matter right with him, "and then come and offer your gift."[^1] 

16. Baptism 

There are three things to be considered in baptism: — 1. The action commanded to be done; — 2. The subject specified; — 3. The meaning or design of that action. Jesus commanded a certain *character* to be the subject of a certain *action,* for a certain specific purpose or *design.*  The  questions,  then,  are,  What  that  action?  What  that subject? What that design? 

***Of The Action of Baptism*** 

The  action  is  indicated  by  a  word  as  definite,  clear,  and unequivocal,  as  any  word  in  any  language  ever  spoken  by  the many-tongued sons of Adam. Besides, in all laws and institutions, and more especially in those that are of a *positive,* rather than a *moral*  nature,  all  words  having  both  a  literal  and  a  figurative meaning,  a  common  and  a  special  signification,  are  to  be understood in their literal and common, and not in their figurative and  uncommon  import  and  acception.  So  have  decided  all  the judges of law and language, from time immemorial. 

That definite and unambiguous word, as almost universally known in these days of controversy, is *baptisma,* or *baptismos,* anglicised, not translated, *baptism.* The primary means by which the meaning of  this  word  is  ascertained  are  the  following:  1.  The  ancient lexicons and dictionaries; — 2. The ancient and modern translations of the New Testament; — 3. The ancient customs of the church; — 4. The  place  and  circumstances  of  baptizing,  as  mentioned  in  the New Testament; — and 5. The allusions to this ordinance and the expositions of it in the apostolic epistles. To each of these we shall do little more than simply advert on the present occasion. 

1. **The ancient lexicons with one consent give *immersion* as the natural, common, and primary sense of this word**. There is not known to us a single exception. Nor is there a received lexicon, ancient or modern, that does ever translate this word by the terms *sprinkling* or *pouring.* And as there are but three *actions* allowed to be Christian baptism; and as the original words, both verbs and nouns are translated *immerse* and *immersion,* in all lexicons, and never *sprinkle* or *pour;* follows it not then, that neither sprinkling, nor  pouring  is  Christian  baptism?  The  question  is  not,  whether these words are ever, like other words, used figuratively: whether they may not *metonymically* mean, *wetting* or *washing;* for these may be the effects of either sprinkling, pouring, or dipping. The question  is  not,  whether  these  words  may  be  so  used:  but  the question  is,  whether  the  action  commanded  in  *baptizo,*  be sprinkling, pouring, or immersing a person. All authorized Greek dictionaries,  ancient  and  modern,  with  one  consent,  affirm  that action to be immersion; and not sprinkling or pouring. 
2. **All Latin, English, German and French versions which we have seen, and we believe on the testimony of others, all that we  have  not  seen,  sometimes  translate  these  words,  their derivatives, or compounds, by words equivalent to *immersion:* but  on  *no  occasion*  ever  translate  them  by  sprinkling,  or pouring, or any other word equivalent to these terms**. This is an evidence  of  great  moment:  for  if  these  versions,  have  nineteen times in twenty been made by those who practice sprinkling or pouring in the name of the Lord; and if these words occur about one hundred and twenty times in the New Testament, is it not very singular that never once have such translators rendered the words by sprinkling, or pouring? a decisive proof in our judgment that it could not be so translated. Indeed, a mere English scholar, who has only heard that *baptism* is a Greek word, may indubitably ascertain that it means neither sprinkling nor pouring, by substituting the definition of the term, and trying its sense in all places where the ordinance is spoken of. This is an infallible canon of interpretation. *The proper definition of a term substituted for it will always make as good sense as the term itself.* Now, if an English reader will try *sprinkling*  or  *pouring*  in  those  places  where  he  finds  the  word *baptism,*  he  will  soon  discover  that  neither  of  these  words  can possibly represent it, if the above canon be true. For instance, we are told, that all Judea and Jerusalem went out to John and were *baptized*  of  him  in  the  Jordan.  Sprinkled  them  *in*  the  Jordan! poured them *in* the Jordan! immersed them in the Jordan. Can any doubt,  which  of  these  truly  represents  the  original  in  such passages?  I  may  sprinkle  or  pour  water  upon  a  person;  but  to sprinkle or pour them into water is impossible. It is not said he baptized water upon them, but he baptized them in water, in the river. 
3. **The ancient church, it is admitted on all hands, practiced immersion.** It did so, Roman, Greek and English historians being worthy of any credit. 
3. **The places where baptism was anciently administered, being rivers, pools, baths, and places of much water, show that it was not sprinkling or pouring**. They went down *into* the water, and came up *out* of it, etc. And John baptized where there were many waters or much water. And even Paul and Silas went out of the Philippian jail to baptize the jailor at night, rather than send for a cup of water! 
3. **It  is  also  alluded  to  and  explained  under  the  figure  of  a burial and resurrection, as relating to the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus, etc**. Rom. 6 and Col. 2. 

   From these topics many clear and conclusive arguments may be drawn, on which it is not now our business to dwell. If, indeed, any one of these five topics be correct, the action that Christ commands is  forever  decided.  How  much  more,  when  they  all  concur  in asserting the same interpretation! There is, then, but one baptism, and not two under the Christian administration. 

***The Subject of Baptism*** 

*Characters,*  not  *persons,*  as  such,  are  the  subjects  of  baptism. *Penitent believers* — not infants nor adults, not males nor females, not Jews nor Greeks; but professors of repentance towards God, and faith in Jesus Christ are the proper subjects of this ordinance. "To  as  many  as  received  him,  to  them  he  granted  privilege  of becoming the sons  of God, to  them that believed on his name, which were born not of flesh, nor of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God." "He that believeth, and is baptized — not he that is baptized and believeth, shall be saved." "Many of the Corinthians hearing, believed and were baptized," not many of the Corinthians were baptized and then believed, and finally heard the Gospel! "for without faith it is impossible to please God," etc. 

***The Meaning of Baptism*** 

"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins." "And Jesus said that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." Therefore, Peter said to the penitent Pentecostians, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus, for the remission of sins." Again, "As many of you as have been baptized or immersed into Christ, have put on Christ, have been immersed into his death;" "have risen with him." 

Baptism is, then, designed to introduce the subjects of it into the participation  of  the  blessings  of  the  death  and  resurrection  of Christ;  who  "died  for  our  sins,"  and  "rose  again  for  our justification."  But  it  has  no  abstract  efficacy.  Without  previous faith in the blood of Christ, and deep and unfeigned repentance before God, neither immersion in water nor any other action can secure  to  us  the  blessings  of  peace  and  pardon.  It  can  merit nothing. Still to the believing penitent it is the *means* of receiving a formal,  distinct,  and  specific  absolution,  or  release  from  guilt. Therefore, none but those who have first believed the testimony of God  and  have  repented  of  their  sins,  and  that  have  been intelligently immersed into  his  death,  have the full and explicit testimony of God, assuring them of pardon. To such only as are truly penitent, dare we say, 'Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord;' and to such only can we say with assurance, "You are washed, you are justified, you are sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of God." But  let  the  reader  examine  with  care  our  special  essay  on  the Remission of Sins, in which this much debated subject is discussed at considerable length. 

17. The Christian Confession of Faith 

    The only apostolic and divine confession of faith which God, the Father  of  all,  has  laid  for  the  church — and  that  on  which  Jesus himself  said  he  would  build  it,  is  the  sublime  and  supreme proposition: **That** **Jesus of** **Nazareth is the** **Messiah, the** **Son of the living** **God**. This is the peculiarity of the Christian system: its specific attribute. The antediluvian Abel, Enoch, etc. believed that a  Son  of  Eve  would  bruise  Satan's  head.  Abraham,  Isaac,  and Jacob believed that a peculiar son of theirs would be the child of blessings, the Son of promise to the human race. Indeed, Jesse, David, and all the Prophets, looked for one from the sceptred tribe, who would be king of all the earth, and a benefactor of humanity. John  the  Baptist,  in  his  day,  preached  and  believed  that  the Messenger of the covenant of eternal peace was immediately to appear.  But  the  disciples  of  Jesus,  son  of  Mary,  believed  and confessed that he was the identical person. "We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and all the Prophets did write; Jesus of Nazareth,  the  Son  of  David,  the  King  of  Israel."  "Rabbi,"  said Nathaniel, "thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel." But yet it remained for Peter to speak fully and expressly, the very proposition which contains the whole matter. "We believe and are sure that thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living God." "On this rock," responded he, with a blessing upon Peter's name and head: "On this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not  prevail against it."  Of this  foundation Paul has said,  "other foundation can no man lay than that which is already laid, which is Jesus Christ." God himself laid this corner, this tried and precious stone, as the foundation of the temple of grace; and therefore with his own lips pronounced him his beloved Son; and sealed him by the visible descent and impress of his Spirit, as his Messiah, the Messenger of Life and Peace to a condemned and rebellious world. 

This  confession  of  faith  has  in  it  two  distinct  ideas — the  one concerning the *person,* the other concerning the *office* of the Son of Man. The one asserts his divine relations, the other, his official rank and glory. No one can intelligently believe this proposition, and not turn to God with all his heart: for there is in it a thousand thoughts and motives, to bind the soul to God, and melt it into the most affectionate devotion. There is also in it the strongest bond to secure the affections of all Christians to one another. There is no other confession of faith, on which the church can be built, on which it can possibly stand one and undivided, but on this one. With  the  heart  man  believes  this  proposition  in  order  to justification; and with his mouth he maketh this confession of it in order to his salvation. So Paul explains it, Rom. x; and thus we have one Lord, one faith, and one baptism, among the immutable reasons why Christians should maintain unity of spirit in the bonds of peace.[^2] 

18. Conversion and Regeneration 

    The change which is consummated by immersion, is sometimes called in sacred style, "*being quickened,*" or "*made alive,*" "*passing from death to life,*" "*being born again,*" "*having risen with Christ,*" "*turning  to  the  Lord,*"  "*being  enlightened,*"  "*conversion,*" "*reconciliation,*"  "*repentance  unto  life.*"  These,  like  the  words propitiation,  atonement,  reconciliation,  expiation,  redemption, expressive  of  the  various  aspects  which  the  death  of  Christ sustains, are expressive of the different relations in which this great change, sometimes called a "new creation," may be contemplated. The entire change effected in man by the Christian system, consists in four things: — a change of views; a change of affections; a change of state; and a change of life. Now, in respect of each of these separately or in combination, it is called by different names. As a change of *views,* it is called "being enlightened;" "Once you were darkness, now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of the light;" "After that you were enlightened," etc. As a change of the *affections,* it is called "being reconciled;" thus, "for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved through his life." As a change of *state,* it is called "being quickened;" "passing from death to life," "being born again," "having risen with Christ," "And you *hath he quickened* who were dead in trespasses and sins," "By this we know we have *passed from death to life,* because we love the  brethren,"  "Being  *born  again,*  not  of  corruptible,  but  of incorruptible  seed,  the  word  of  God,  which  liveth  and  abideth forever." "If you be," or "since you *are risen with Christ,* set your affections  on  things  above,  not  on  things  on  the  earth."  As  a change of *life* it is called "repentance unto life," "turning to the Lord,"  "conversion;"  "Then  God  has  granted  to  the  Gentiles repentance to life." "And all that dwelt in Lydda and Saron saw Eneas  and  *turned  to  the  Lord.*"  "Except  you  be  converted,  and become as children, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven." "When  thou  art  converted,  strengthen  thy  brethren."  "He  that converts a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and hide a multitude of sins." 

Great confusion has been introduced into the Christian community by a confounding of these terms, making only one of them to mean all the others. Witness the controversy about *regeneration;* as if that word were used in sacred Scripture in reference to the entire change  effected  by  the  Christian  system;  whereas,  in  strict propriety, it is never used by itself in the Bible to represent any part of this change, much less the whole of it. We have the phrase "*washing  of  regeneration*"  once,  in  contradistinction  from  the "renewal of the Holy Spirit," (Titus 3:5) but never, by itself, as indicative  of  this  four-fold  change.  But  suppose  it  should  be conceded, that the term *regeneration* might be just equivalent to "*being born again,*" it could even then only represent so much of this change as respects mere *state:* for the figure of a new birth applies merely to admission into a family or nation; and not to the process of quickening or making alive of the person so admitted. It can, then, in strict propriety, only apply to the fourth part of that change which the gospel of salvation proposes and effects. Being *born again* is, or may be the *effect* of a change of views, of a change of affections; or it may be the *cause* of a change of life; but certain it is, it is not identical with any of them, and never can represent them all. 

But may it not include them all? It is impossible: for however we might  extend the figure and suppose it to  include its causes, it cannot also include its  effects.  If it should include a change of views,  a  change  of  affections,  and  a  change  of  state,  it  cannot include a change of life, or of character. We ought then to use this word in its strict and scriptural acceptance, if we would escape the great confusion now resting upon this subject. The sophistry or delusion of this confusion is, that making *regeneration* equivalent to  the  entire  change  instead  of  to  be  one-fourth  part  of  it,  the community will always be imposed on and misled by seeking to find the attributes of conversion in the new birth, or of the new birth in conversion; and so of all the others. Being born again is not *conversion,* nor a *change of views,* nor a *change of affections,* but a *change of state.* True, indeed, that of the person who is born again we may suppose a change of views, a change of heart, and we may infer  a  change  of  character,  and  may  therefore  say  he  is enlightened, renewed in heart, converted as well as born again; but this license respecting the *person,* the subject of the change, is not allowed in talking of the *change* itself. A Christian is, indeed, one whose  views  are  enlightened,  whose  heart  is  renewed,  whose relations to God and the moral universe are changed, and whose manner of life is according to righteousness and true holiness. 

19. Christians are Persons Pardoned, Justified, Sanctified, Adopted, and Saved. 

    While  adjusting  the  most  important  terms  and  phrases  in  the Christian  system,  in  order  to  a  more  perspicuous  and comprehensive intelligence of it, it is expedient that we should also advert to other predicates of the genuine Christian. The five terms at the head of this chapter are all indicative of his *state;* and do not include any attributes of his *character.* 

These predicates are but  so  many counterpart aspects  of a new state in reference to an old one; or they represent the gospel as affecting the position of man in the universe in all those points in which sin affected him. Was he guilty, condemned, unholy, alien, and lost, in Adam the first? When in Adam the second, he is just in an opposite state; — he is pardoned wherein he was guilty — justified wherein  he  was  condemned — sanctified  wherein  he  was unholy — adopted wherein he was alien — and saved wherein he was lost.  Sin,  then,  condemns,  pollutes,  alienates,  and  destroys  its subjects. Grace justifies, sanctifies, adopts, and saves its subjects in reference to these points. Pardon has respect to guilt; justification, to  condemnation;  sanctification,  to  pollution;  adoption,  to alienation; and salvation, to destruction. Those *out of Christ,* are then, in their sins, condemned, unholy, alien, and lost; while those *in Christ* are pardoned, justified, sanctified, adopted into the family of God, and saved. 

In  former  dispensations,  and  in  the  present,  two  things  are immutable as respects the preparation for a change of state, while the  act  by  which  that  change  is  formally  consummated  is  not necessarily immutable. Thus, in reference to actual transgression, faith  and  repentance,  in  all  dispensations  of  religion,  were necessary  to  forgiveness,  justification,  sanctification,  adoption, salvation.  In  one  word,  God  cannot  forgive  an  impenitent  and unbelieving  transgressor.  But  whether  this  or  that  act  shall consummate a change of state, as respects man's relations to the moral  universe;  whether  that  act  shall  be  circumcision,  animal sacrifice,  baptism,  confession,  prayer,  etc.  is  not  from  any necessity, either in the divine or human nature, immutable. It has been changed; but faith in God's appointments, and repentance for past transgressions, are now, always were, and ever more shall be, necessary to forgiveness. 

The  philosophy  or  reason  of  this  is,  that  faith  and  repentance change  the  state  of  man's  heart  to  God;  and  if  there  was  no universe beyond God and the sinner, all farther acts respecting it would be uncalled for. But as respects the condition of sinners in the universe, and their views, affections, relations, and manner of life, more than faith and repentance, or a change of views  and feelings, is necessary to actual, and sensible, and formal pardon, justification, sanctification, adoption, and the salvation of the soul from  sin.  Hence  came  the  ordinances  of  baptism,  confession, prayer, fasting, and intercession. 

It is wise and kind on the part of Heaven to ordain such acts, or to institute such ordinances as will assure ourselves and others of our new relations; and to suspend our *enjoyment* of the favor and love of God, not merely upon faith and penitence, or any other mental operation;  but  upon  certain  clear,  overt  acts,  such  as  baptism, confession, prayer, etc. which affect ourselves and others, much more than they possibly can affect God himself; being the fruit of our faith, or perhaps, rather, only the perfecting of our faith in the promises of God.  

20. The Gift of the Holy Spirit 

    Having spoken of three things which God has done for us, and of three things which we must do for ourselves, we are now come to the proper place to consider other aids which our heavenly Father tenders to us, just at this point. "He has provided a Lamb for a sin offering," and "Jesus has full atonement made." He has also given to us "the *light* of life" — the words of Jesus faithfully written out; and he has invested him as the Son of Man, with all authority, celestial and terrestrial, that he may lead many sons to glory, and give eternal life to all that are given him. 

We  also  have  believed  all  this;  repented  of  our  sins,  and  been immersed into Christ. We have assumed him as our Leader — our Prophet, Priest, and King; and put ourselves under his guidance. Having disowned the  great  apostate  and his  ranks, and enlisted under the Messiah, and taken sides with the Lord's Anointed; he now proposes to put his Holy Spirit within us, to furnish us for the good fight of faith, and to anoint us as the sons and heirs of God. 

Some will ask, Has not this gift been conferred on us to make us Christians? True, indeed, no man can say, that Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Spirit. As observed in its proper place, the Spirit of God is the perfecter, and finisher of all divine works. "The Spirit of God moved upon the waters;" "The hand of the Lord has made me, the Spirit of the Almighty has given me life;" "By his Spirit he has garnished the heavens, his hand has formed the crooked serpent," the milky way; "The Spirit descended upon him;" "God himself bore the Apostles witness, by divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit according to his will;" "Holy men of old spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit;" "When the Spirit of truth, the Advocate is come, he will convict the world of sin, because they believe not on me, and of justification, because I go to my Father;" "God was manifest in the flesh and justified by the Spirit."  

The  Spirit  of  God  inspired  all  the  spiritual  ideas  in  the  New Testament, and confirmed them by miracles; and he is ever present with the word that he inspired. He descended from heaven on the day of Pentecost, and has not formally ascended since. In the sense in which he descended he certainly has not ascended: for he is to animate and inspire with new life the church or temple of the Lord. "Know you not," you Christians, "that your bodies are temples of the living God;" "The temple of God is holy, which temple you are;" "If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, God shall quicken your mortal bodies by *his Spirit that dwelleth in you,*" etc. 

Now we cannot separate the Spirit and word of God, and ascribe so much power to the one and so much to the other; for so did not the Apostles. Whatever the word does, the Spirit does; and what ever the Spirit does in the work of converting men, the word does. We neither  believe  nor  teach  abstract  Spirit  nor  abstract  word — but word and Spirit, and Spirit and word. 

But the Spirit is not *promised to any persons out of Christ.* It is promised  only  to  them  that  believe  in  and  obey  him.  These  it actually and powerfully assists in the mighty struggle for eternal life.  Some,  indeed,  ask,  'Do  Christians  need  more  aid  to  gain eternal life — than sinners do to become Christians? Is not the work of  conversion  a  more  difficult  work  than  the  work  of sanctification?' Hence, they contend more for the work of the Spirit in  conversion,  than  for  the  work  of  the  Spirit  in  sanctification. This, indeed, is a mistaken view of the matter, if we reason either from analogy or from divine testimony. Is it not more easy to plant, than to cultivate the corn, the vine, the olive? Is it not more easy to enlist in the army, than to be a good soldier, and fight the battles of the Lord; to start in the race, than to reach the goal; to enter the ship than cross the ocean; to be naturalized, than to become a good citizen;  to  enter  into  the  matrimonial  compact  than  to  be  an exemplary husband; to enter life, than to retain and sustain it for three score years and ten? And while the commands, "*believe,*" "*repent,*"  and  "*be  baptized,*"  are  never  accompanied  with  any intimation of peculiar difficulty; the commands to the use of the means of spiritual health and life; to form the Christian character; to attain the resurrection of the just; to lay hold on eternal life; to make our calling and election sure, etc. are accompanied with such exhortations, admonitions, cautions, as to make it a difficult and critical affair, requiring all the aids of the Spirit of our God, to all the means of grace and untiring assiduity and perseverance on our part; for it seems, "the called" who enter the stadium are many, while "the chosen" and approved "are few;" and many, says Jesus, "shall seek to enter into the heavenly city, and shall not be able;" "Let us labor, therefore, to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief." 

Sanctification in one point of view, is unquestionably a progressive work. To sanctify is to set apart; this may be done in a moment, and  so  far  as  mere  *state*  or  *relation*  is  concerned,  it  is  as instantaneous  as  baptism.  But  there  is  the  formation  of  a  holy character: for there is a holy *character* as well as a holy *state.* The formation of such a character is the work of means; "Holy Father," said Jesus, "sanctify them, through the truth; thy word is the truth;" "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly," says Paul to the Thessalonians, "and I pray God  your whole spirit and soul and body  be  preserved  blameless  to  the  coming  of  our  Lord  Jesus Christ." Christians, then, are to "follow peace with all men, and sanctification,  without  which  no  one  shall  see  the  Lord." Therefore, it is the duty and the work of Christians, "to *perfect* holiness in the fear of the Lord." 

This requires aid. Hence, assistance is to be prayed for; and it is promised. Now as the Spirit of God, under the administration of Christ, is the author of all holiness in us — he is called the "Holy Spirit," "the Spirit of holiness." Hence, while we have the phrase "Holy  Ghost"  or  Spirit,  *ninety-four  times*  in  the  Christian Scriptures, it is found only three times in all the Jewish writings. The Holy Spirit is, then, the author of all our holiness; and in the struggle  after  victory  over  sin  and  temptation,  "*it  helps  our infirmities,*"  and  comforts  us  by  seasonably  bringing  to  our remembrance the promises of Christ, and "strengthens us with all might, in the new, or inner man." And thus "God works in us to will and to do of his own benevolence," "while we are working out our  own  salvation  with  fear  and  trembling."  Christians  are, therefore, clearly and unequivocally temples of the Holy Spirit; and they are quickened, animated, encouraged, and sanctified by the power and influence of the Spirit of God, working in them through the truth. 

God "gives his Holy Spirit to them who ask him," according to his revealed  will;  and  without  this  gift  no  one  could  be  saved  or ultimately triumph over all opposition. He knows but little of the deceitfulness of sin, or of the combatting of temptation, who thinks himself competent to wrestle against the allied forces of the world, the  flesh  and  the  devil.  Hence,  the  necessity  of  "supplications, deprecations, intercessions, and thanksgivings," or praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Holy Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance, and of making supplication for all saints, our fellow soldiers in this good warfare. 

To  those,  then,  who  believe,  repent,  and  obey  the  gospel,  he actually communicates of his Good Spirit. The fruits of that spirit in them, are "love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, fidelity, meekness, temperance." The attributes of character which distinguish the new man, are each of them communications of the Holy Spirit, and thus we are the sons of God in fact, as well as in title, under the dispensations of the Holy Spirit. 

We  have,  then,  every  thing  done  for  us,  after  our  conversion, which we need in order to that "holiness without which no one shall see the Lord." Thus God has provided for us a sin offering; a *prophet* to expound it; a *priest* to present it; a *king,* with universal dominion, to govern, and protect all that by it are reconciled to God. And when through faith, repentance, and baptism, we have assumed  him  as  our  rightful  Sovereign,  by  his  Holy  Spirit,  in answer to our prayers, he worked in us, and by us, and for us, all that is needful to our present, spiritual, and eternal salvation. 

21. The Christian Hope 

"Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him — that we shall see him as he is. And every one that has this hope in him, purifies himself even as he is pure." "God has predestinated us to be conformed to the image off his Son." "I reckon  that  the  sufferings  of  this  life  are  not  worthy  to  be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us." "He hath begotten us again to a lively hope; to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled,  and  that  fadeth  not  away."  So  testify  three Apostles — John, Paul, and Peter. The whole hope of the Christian may, indeed, be summed up in one sentence;  "If children, then *heirs — heirs of God,* **joint heirs with christ**." Immortality, eternal life, the riches  of Christ, the glory, honor,  wealth, and bliss  of God's only begotten Son are to be equally participated with all his saints. 

The remedial system is, therefore, a moral creation in progress — a new  creation  of  men  unto  good  works,  still  advancing;  but  its termination will be the stereotyping of individual moral excellence by  an  instantaneous  physical  new  creation  of  men  at  the resurrection of the just: or a manifestation of the sons of God in full  redemption  from  the  whole  entail  of  sin;  raised,  refined, immortalized glorified, and invested with eternal life. 

Hope differs from faith, in  that it looks only  forward to future objects.  It  looks  not  back,  nor  does  it  contemplate  the  present: "for," says Paul, "what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?" Nor looks it on all the future; but only on future *good.* It desires and expects good and nothing else. There is not one dark cloud, not one dark speck, in all the heavens of Christian hope. Every thing seen in its wide dominions, in the unbounded prospect yet before us, is bright,  cheering,  animating,  transporting.  It  is  all  desirable  and desired.  It  is  all  expected.  It  is  all  "earnest  expectation;"  not  a doubtful, but a "confident expectation of things" desirable, and to be "hoped for." 

It is not what some in this age call "the hope," i.e. the desirable expectancy  of  pardon  of  their  past  transgressions:  for  none  but those who are actually pardoned are the subjects of this hope. "If our heart condemn us, then indeed, we have no confidence;" so no confident expectation, no hope of eternal life. The mere possibility of  an  event  is  no  foundation  of  hope.  Hope  deals  not  in possibilities, nor indeed much in probabilities — unless they are very strong  probabilities.  Conjectures,  peradventures,  possibilities, probabilities, are not of the essence of Christian hope. It rests on covenants,  charters,  promises,  oaths,  tendered  by  the  Eternal Source of almighty truth and love. These are good securities; and produce assurance. Hence, hope is the assurance of future good in expectation.  

There are, indeed, various degrees of hope; but in the least degree of it there is desire combined with expectation. Things expected are  not  always  desirable,  nor  are  things  desirable  always  to  be expected: but hope embraces promises that are desirable, and also expects the enjoyment of them. Hence, hope, like faith and love, may grow exceedingly. When based on the promises of God, and on an habitual patient conformity to his will, it will keep pace with our growing intelligence of the character of God; of the fulness and richness  of  the  promises,  and  in  the  persuasion  of  our  actual devotion to the manifestations of that will. 

But *the things hoped for* by the Christian are beyond description. Eye, indeed, has not seen, ear has not heard, the human heart has not conceived the glories of the resurrection of the just; — the new bodies, the new heavens, the new earth, the new Jerusalem, the new society, the new pleasures: for according to his promise we look for (expect) new heavens and new earth in which righteous persons alone shall dwell. Thus terminates the remedial system on all its happy subjects. "It lifts the beggar from the dust, and the wretched from the dunghill, and sets them among princes, amongst the nobles of the universe;" the thrones, hierarchies, and lordships of the skies; in the presence of God, too, "where there is fulness of joy, and at his right hand, where there are pleasures forever more." Such are the things to be done for those, for whom such things have already been done as constitute the remedial system: for with Paul we must say: "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up to the death for us all; how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?" "All things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all are yours; and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's." 

22. The Doom of the Wicked 

There are two classes of men in this world. They are often and in various  manners  contradistinguished  from  each  other.  They  are called the righteous and the wicked, the saints and the sinners, the holy and the unholy, the good and the bad, he that feareth God, and he that feareth him not. Of the one class manythings are predicated which are not predicated of the other. Of the one it is said, that they "in Christ," justified, sanctified, saved, children of God, heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ, an elect race, a royal priesthood, a peculiar  people.  Of  the  other  class,  these  things  are  never predicated in the Bible. They are not in Christ, not justified, not sanctified, not saved; children of the devil, "children of wrath," not an elect race, not a royal priesthood, not a peculiar people. 

These have not been reconciled to God through the propitiation of his Son. They are still enemies of God in heart. And for them that loved darkness rather than light, and would not have God's Son to be their Savior, he has appointed a day of judgment; a day for the ultimate perdition of ungodly men. Then they shall perish "with an everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, when he shall come to be glorified in all his saints, and to be admired by all the believers." Then will the King say to them on his left hand, "Depart, you cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels." They are the allies of Satan in his rebellion against God, and have spent their energies and  fortunes  on  his  side  of  the  question;  and  therefore  it  is reasonable that they should have their ultimate portion with him. 

Of  this  judgment,  Enoch,  the  seventh  from  Adam,  prophesied, saying, "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints, to execute  judgment  upon  all,  and  to  convict  all  that  are  ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him." God had, then, long before the Christian era — from the foundation of the world, "*appointed a day* in which he will judge **the world**, (the whole world,) righteously by Jesus Christ," whom he has constituted Judge of all the dead as well as of the living. 

"It  is,  indeed,  appointed  to  men  once  to  die,  and  after  this  the judgment."  The  judgment  consequent  upon  death,  is  not  the general but the particular judgment of individuals, as the phrase would seem to indicate, whose spirits returning to God are judged and instantly rewarded, so far as in a separate state they can be the subjects of reward or punishment. But the "*judgment of the great day,*" is for another purpose: not, as some profanely say, "to bring men out of heaven and hell to judge and remand them back again;" but  in  the  presence  of  an  assembled  world  to  vindicate  the administration of the moral government and providence of God, to develop the real characters of angels and of men, and to pronounce an irrevocable sentence upon all according to their works. For, says Paul, "we must all appear before the tribunal of Christ, that every one may receive, *in his body,* the things he has done, whether good or bad." It is, then, because of the actual and public pronunciation and execution of this judgment, that the last day is called "**the day of judgment**," and that the judgment itself if called "**the judgment of the great day**." 

The final judgment and "*perdition of ungodly men*" is set forth by the Lord himself, as well as by his Apostles, in the clearest and strongest  terms,  and  in  the  boldest  and  most  appalling  imagery which human speech and human knowledge can afford. Indeed, to place this awfully sublime and glorious day in full array before the perceptive  powers  of  man,  is  impossible.  The  best  efforts  have exhausted the powers of nature in all her wonted energies. John, in his sublime visions of the last acts of the great drama of human existence, says, "I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face earth and heaven fled away, and there was found no room for them. And  I saw the  dead, small and  great,  stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened,  which  is  called  the  Book  of  Life;  and  the  dead  were judged out of the things that were written in those books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and the grave1 gave up the dead which were in them; and 

they were judged every one according to his works: and death and 

the grave were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the **Book of** **Life** was cast into the lake of fire." Surely "it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God." 

**1 Hades.** 

23. Summary of the Christian System of Facts 

    God alone is self-existent and eternal. Before earth and time were born he operated by his **Word** and his **Spirit**. **God, the** **Word of** **God**, and  **the** **Spirit  of**  **God**, participants  of one and the same nature,  are  the  foundations  of  *Nature,  Providence,*  and *Redemption.* In *Nature* and *Providence,* it is **God**, the **Word**, and the **Spirit**. In *Grace,* it is the **Father**, the **Son**, and the **Holy** **Spirit**. All creations, providences, and remedial arrangements display to us  the  co-operation  of  **three  divine  participants**,  of  one self-existent,  independent,  incommunicable  nature.  These  are fundamental conceptions of all the revelations and developments of the Divinity, and necessary to all rational and sanctifying views of religion. 

In the *Law* and in the *Gospel* these sacred and mysterious relations and personal manifestations of God are presupposed and assumed as the basis of the whole procedure. "God created *all things* by Jesus Christ, and for him." "The Word was in the beginning with God," "before all things," and "by him all things consist." "God created man upright." Man sinned: all became mortal: our nature became susceptible of evil. It is in this respect fallen and depraved. "There is none righteous — no, not one." God the Father has chosen men in Christ to salvation "through the sanctification of the Spirit unto  obedience,  and  sprinkling  of  the  blood  of  Jesus;"  and "promised,"  to  such,  "eternal  life  before  the  foundation  of  the world." 

Therefore, in "the fulness of time" — "in *due* time, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman" — for "the **Word** became flesh, and dwelt among  us;  and  we  beheld  his  glory,  the  glory  as  of  an  only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." "He showed us the Father." He died as a sin-offering — was buried, rose again the third day — ascended to heaven — presented his offering in the true Holy Place — made expiation for our sins — "forever sat down on the right hand of the Supreme Majesty in the heavens" — sent down his Holy Spirit — inspired his Apostles, who "preached with the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven" — persuaded many Jews and Gentiles that he was made "the author of an eternal salvation to all who obeyed him."  He  commanded  faith,  repentance,  and  baptism  to  be preached in his name for remission of sins to every nation and people under heaven. 

All who "believe in him are justified from all things;" because this faith is living, active, operative, and perfected by "obeying from the  heart  that  mould  of  doctrine  delivered  to  us."  Hence  such persons repent of their sins, and obey the gospel. They receive the Spirit of God, and the promise of eternal life — walk in the Spirit, and are sanctified to God, and constituted heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. They shall be raised from the dead incorruptible, immortal, and shall live forever with the Lord; while those "who know not God, and obey not the gospel of his Son, shall perish with an everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power." 

24. The Body of Christ 

That institution which separate from the world, and consociates the people of God into a peculiar community; having laws, ordinances, manners, and customs of its own, immediately derived from the Savior of the world, is called the *congregation* or *church* of the Lord. This is sometimes technically called the *mystical* body of Christ, contradistinguished from his literal and natural body. Over this spiritual body he is the Head, the King, Lord, and Lawgiver, and  they  are  severally  members  of  his  body,  and  under  his direction and government. 

The *true* Christian church, or house of God, is composed of all those  in  every  place  that  do  publicly  acknowledge  Jesus  of Nazareth as the true Messiah, and the only Savior of men; and, building  themselves  upon  the  foundation  of  the  Apostles  and Prophets,  associate under the constitution which he himself has granted and authorized in the New Testament, and are walking in his ordinances and commandments — and of none else. 

This  institution,  called  *the  congregation  of  God,*  is  a  great community  of  communities — not  a  community  representative  of communities;  but  a  community  composed  of  many  particular communities; each of which is built upon the same foundation, walks according to the same rules, enjoys the same charter, and is under the jurisdiction of no other community of Christians; but is to all other communities as an individual disciple is to every other individual disciple in any one particular community meeting in any given place.  

Still,  all  these  particular  congregations  of  the  Lord,  whether  at Rome,  Corinth,  or  Ephesus,  though  equally  independent  of  one another, as to the management of their own peculiar affairs; are, by virtue  of  one  common  Lord,  one  faith,  one  baptism,  and  one common salvation, but one kingdom or church of God; and, as such, are under obligations to co-operate with one another in all measures  promotive  of  thee  great  ends  of  Christ's  death  and resurrection. 

But, in order to this holy communion and co-operation of churches, it  is  indispensable  that  they  have  an  intimate  and  approving knowledge of one another, which can only be had and enjoyed in the form of districts. Thus the "congregations in Judea" intimately knew one another, and co-operated. Those in Galatia also knew one another, and co-operated. And while some of the churches or brethren in each district being mutually acquainted with some in another, made the churches of both districts acquainted with one another, they were enabled to co-operate, to the ends of the earth. 

These districts are a part of the *circumstances* of Christ's kingdom, as  well  as  the  *manner*  of  maintaining  correspondence  and co-operation  among  them,  and  the  occasions  and  incidents requiring concert and conjoint action. For these, as well as for the circumstantials of any particular community, the Apostles gave no specific directions. It was, indeed, impossible they could: for as the circumstances of particular communities, and of the whole church, vary  at  different  times  and  places,  no  one  set  of  particular, sectional,  or  intersectional  regulations  could  suit  all  these peculiarities and emergencies. These, then, are necessarily left to the wisdom and discretion of the whole community, as the peculiar exigencies and mutations of society may require. 

But  in  granting to  the  communities of the saints  this necessary license  of  deciding  what  is  expedient,  orderly,  decent,  and  of public and practical utility in the circumstantials of Christianity, no allowance  is  implied  authorizing  any  interference  with  a  single item of the Christian institution. Hence the necessity of a very clear discrimination, not between "the essentials and non-essentials," for in Divine Christianity there are no non-essentials; but between the family  of  God  and  its  circumstances — between  the  Christian institution  and  its  accidents.  Certain  it  is  that  there  is  a  very manifest  difference  between  any  individual  man,  family, community,  or  institution,  and  its  circumstances.  What  more evident than the difference between a man  and his  apparel,  his house, his neighborhood, his associations and connections? 

The Christian institution has its facts, its precepts, its promises, its ordinances, and their meaning or doctrine. These are not matters of policy,  of  arrangement,  of  expediency;  but  of  divine  and immutable  ordination  and  continuance.  Hence  the  faith,  the worship, and the righteousness; or the doctrine, the piety, and the morality  of  the  gospel  institution  are  not  legitimate  subjects  of human  legislation,  alteration,  or  arrangement.  No  man  nor community can touch these and be innocent. These rest upon the wisdom and authority of Jehovah; and he that meddles with these, presumes to do that which the cherubim and seraphim dare not. Whatever, then, is a part of the Christian faith or the Christian hope — whatever constitutes ordinances or precepts of worship, or statutes of moral right and wrong, like the ark of the covenant, is not to be touched with uninspired and uncommissioned hands. 

But whether we shall register the churches in a given district, or the members in a particular church; whether we shall meet oftener than once on the Lord's day, or at what hour, and in what sort of house; whether we shall commemorate the Lord's death forenoon or afternoon, before day or after night; whether we shall sit round one board, or in our respective pews; whether we shall sing from book or from memory, prose or verse, etc. etc. are matters in which our conceptions of expediency, decency, and good order may have free scope. Also, whether the churches in a given district shall, by letter, messengers, or stated meetings, once or twice per annum, or oftener, communicate with one another; whether they shall send one, two, or twenty persons, or all go and communicate face to face, or send a letter; and whether they shall annually print, write, or publish their statistics, etc. etc. etc. are the mere circumstantials of the Christian institution. 

But co-operation itself is one thing, and the manner of co-operation another.  Co-operation,  as  much  as  the  intercommunion  of Christians, is a part of the Christian institution. We must "*strive together* in our prayers" for one another, and for the salvation of men; and this, if there were no scriptural example nor precept on the subject, is enough. To pray for one another as individuals or communities, implies that we shall assist one another in very way for  which  we  pray  for  one  another:  otherwise  our  prayers  and thanksgivings for each other are mere hypocrisy. He that would pray for the progress of the truth at home and abroad, having it in his  power  to  contribute  a  single  dollar  to  that  end,  and  yet withholds it, shows how little value he sets upon his own prayers, and how much upon his money. 

From the days of the Apostles till now co-operative associations of churches have uniformly followed the political distributions of the earth.  Those  "in  Judea,  Galatia,  Achaia,  Pontus,  Cappadocia, Macedonia, Asia, Bithynia," etc. etc. are designations of churches and  brethren  familiar  to  all  New  Testament  readers.  This  is  a matter  of  convenience,  rather  than  of  necessity;  just  as  the churches  in  Pennsylvania,  Virginia,  Ohio,  Kentucky,  etc.  can generally more conveniently and successfully co-operate by states and territories, than by any other divisions or precincts. I say, this is matter of convenience, rather than of necessity. It is of necessity that we co-operate, but of convenience that the churches in one county,  state,  or  nation,  form  regular  ways  and  means  for co-operation. 

The  necessity  of  co-operation  is  felt  every  where  and  in  all associations of men. It is a part of the economy of Heaven. What are mountains, but grains of sand! What are oceans, but drops of water! And what the mightiest and most triumphant armies, but collections of individual men! How much more good or ill can be done by co-operation, than by individual enterprise, the history of the world, both civil and ecclesiastic, does little more than detail. One hundred churches,  well disciplined, acting  in  concert, with Christian  zeal,  piety,  humanity — frequently  meeting  together  in committees of ways and means for building up Zion, for fencing in the deserts, cultivating the enclosed fields, watering the dry and barren spots, striving together mightily in prayer, in preaching the word,  in  contributing  to  the  necessities  of  the  saints,  in enlightening the ignorant, and in devising all practicable ways of doing good — would, in a given period, do more than twice the same number  acting  in  their  individual  capacity,  without  concert, without co-operation, and that united energy, always the effect of intelligent and cordial combination. 

But, in order to this, Christians must regard the church, or body of Christ,  as  one  community,  though  composed  of  many  small communities, each of which is an organized member of this great national organization; which, under Christ, as the supreme and sole Head, King, Lord, and Lawgiver, has the conquest of the whole world in its prayers, aims, plans, and efforts. Hence, there must be such  an  understanding  and  agreement  between  these  particular congregations as will suffice to a recognition and approval of their several  acts;  so  that  the  members,  or  the  measures  of  one community shall be treated with the respect due to them at home, in whatever community they may happen to be presented. On this principle  only  can  any  number  of  independent  and  distinct communities of any sort — political, commercial, literary, moral, or religious — act in concert with mutual advantage to themselves, and with a proper reference to the general good. 

Any  one  who  seeks  apostolic  sanctions  for  these  view  of co-operation, will find ample authority in the Acts and Epistles of the Apostles. Paul addresses "*all the saints* in Rome" in his Epistle to  the  Romans.  Now  in  Rome  there  were  sundry  churches,  as appears from chap. 16: 5, 10, 11, 14, 15. These all he addresses as one single community. Again he represents "all the churches of the Gentiles" as uniting in thanks to Priscilla and Aquila, 16: 4. He also represents "the churches of Christ" as uniting salutations by him to the Romans, ver. 16. In his letters to the Corinthians he addresses the church of Corinth, "All the saints which are in all Achaia," and "all them in every place who call upon the name of Jesus  Christ."  1  Cor.  1:2;  2  Cor.  1:1.  There  he  exhorts  to  "be perfectly  joined  together  in  the  same  mind  and  in  the  same judgments."  1  Cor.  1:10.  "The  churches  in  Asia  united  in  their salutations to the Corinthians," chap. 16: 19. He speaks in the 2d Epistle of all the churches in Achaia, as "helping together in prayer for him" and his companions, and of their helping him on his way in the work of the Lord. In the 8th chapter he informs them of the grace of God bestowed on "all churches in Macedonia," evinced by the liberality of their united contributions to the saints. He also speaks of an equality in the mutual contributions of churches in one co-operation — and of a brother chosen by sundry communities to travel with the Apostles, 8: 14, 18, 19.; and of his accompanying brethren as "messengers of the churches." The whole 9th chapter of this epistle speaks of the co-operation of the churches in public contributions for common objects. Paul, and all the brethren with him, unite in the epistle to "all the churches in Galatia." These he commands to "bear one another's burdens, and thus to fulfil the law of Christ." But, indeed, all the *catholic epistles* are unequivocal proofs that co-operation is  of the very essence of the Christian institution. Such are some of Paul's epistles, both the epistles of Peter, the 1st of John, and that of James and Jude. The very basis of  such  general  or  universal  letters  is  the  fact,  that  all  the communities  of  Christ  constitute  but  one  body,  and  are individually  and  mutually  bound  to  co-operate  in  all  things pertaining to a common salvation. 

25. The Christian Ministry 

"He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for *the work of the ministry,* for the edifying of the body of Christ; till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ," etc. For the  setting  up  of  the  Christian  institution  officers  extraordinary were needed. So was it in the Jewish, and so is it every institution, human  and  divine.  But  when  an  institution  is  set  up,  it  only requires an ordinary ministry or administration of its affairs. All the extraordinary gifts vouchsafed to Moses, and to the Apostles and  Prophets  of  the  gospel  institution,  ceased  when  these institutions were fully developed and established. Still a regular and  constant  ministry  was  needed  among  the  Jews,  and  is  yet needed  among  the  Christians;  and  both  of  these  by  divine authority. 

Natural gifts for a natural state of things, and supernatural gifts for a supernatural state of things, are, in the wisdom of both God and man, apposite and needful. Hence, even in the apostolic age, there were officers without, as well as with, miraculous endowments. "Having, then, gifts differing according to the office, or grace that is  given  to  us — if  prophecy,  let  us  prophesy  according  to  the measure of our faith; or ministry, let us attend on our ministering; he that teacheth, on teaching; he that exhorteth, on exhortation; he that distributeth, with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence." God has therefore conferred various gifts on the church for the effectual administration of its affairs. He has placed in it "*helps* and *governments,*" as well as Apostles and Prophets. 

The standing and immutable ministry of the Christian community is  composed  of  Bishops,  Deacons,  and  Evangelists.  Of  each  of these is but one order, though possessing great diversities of gifts. There  have  been  bishops,  deacons,  and  evangelists,  with  both ordinary and extraordinary gifts. Still the office is now, and ever was,  the  same.  In  ancient  times  official  and  unofficial  persons sometimes possessed miraculous gifts. Those in high office were also generally of those most eminently gifted with extraordinary powers. Superficial readers have, therefore, sometimes concluded that,  inasmuch  as  bishops,  deacons  and  especially  evangelists, frequently possessed these manifestations of the Holy Spirit, with the ceasing of those gifts, the offices themselves also expired. This is a great mistake. Officers there must be while there are offices, or services to be performed. So long as the human system needs sight, hearing, and feeling, there will be eyes, ears, and hands. So long also  as  the  Christian  body  is  an  organized  body,  having  many services to perform, it must have organs or officers by which to enjoy itself and operate on society. 

There  are,  indeed,  necessarily  as  many  offices  in  ever  body  as there are services to be performed to it, or by it. This is the root and reason of all the offices in all the universe of God. Our planet needs diverse celestial services to be performed to it. Hence, the sun, moon, and stars are celestial officers ministering to it. The eye,  the  ear,  the  tongue,  the  hand,  the  foot,  are,  for  the  same reason, officers in the human body, essentially serving it in its vital interests  and  enjoyments;  and  by  means  of  these  organs,  it performs important functions to other bodies. 

Experience,  as  well as  observation, has taught  us that "practice makes perfect," and that "whatever is every person's business is no person's  business."  Hence  arose  the  custom  among  men  of communicating  certain  offices  to  particular  individuals.  The philosophy of such elections and ordinances is found in the fact, that  special  services  are  best  performed  by  special  organs  or agents, whose special province and duty is to attend to them. 

As the Christian system is a perfect system, it wisely provides for its own perpetuity and prosperity by creating all necessary offices and filling them with suitable persons. We have said these offices are  three,  and  of  perpetual,  because  of  necessary  existence. *Bishops,* whose office it is to preside over, to instruct, and to edify the community — to feed the church of the Lord with knowledge and understanding — and to watch for their souls as those that must give account to the Lord at his appearing and his kingdom, compose the first  class.  *Deacons,*  or  servants — whether  called  treasurers, almoners,  stewards,  door-keepers,  or  messengers,  constitute  the second. For the term *deacon* originally included all public servants whatever,  though  now  most  commonly  confined  to  one  or  two classes; and improperly, no doubt, to those only who attend to the mere temporal interests of the community. They are distinguished persons,  called  and  commissioned  by  the  church,  (and consequently are always responsible to it,) to serve in any of these capacities.  Evangelists,  however,  though  a  class  of  public functionaries created by the church, do not serve it directly; but are by  it  sent  out  into  the  world,  and  constitute  the  third  class  of functionaries belonging to the Christian system. 

As there is more scrupulosity on some minds concerning the third class of Evangelists, than concerning either Bishops or Deacons, we shall take occasion to speak more explicitly and fully upon the nature and necessity, as well as upon the authority of this office. Evangelists,  as  the  term  indicates,  are  persons  devoted  to  the preaching of the word, to the making of converts, and the planting of  churches.  It  is,  indeed,  found  but  three  times  in  the  New Covenant; but the verb from which it comes — viz. to *evangelize,* is in some of its branches found almost sixty times in that volume. "To evangelize" and "to do the work of an evangelist" are phrases of  equal  import,  and  indicate  the  same  duties,  rights,  and privileges. 

Among the offices which were comprehended in the apostleship, none required more varied endowments than that of the Evangelist. The gift of tongues was amongst the qualifications necessary to those who, after the ascension, first undertook this work. But the qualifications for this office, so far as the gift of tongues or the knowledge of language is concerned, are not immutably fixed. It depends upon the field of labor which the Evangelist is to occupy, whether  he  must  speak  on  language  or  more.  His  work  is  to proclaim the word intelligibly and persuasively — to immerse all the believers, or converts of his ministry — and to plant and organize churches wherever he may have occasion; and then teach them to keep the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. 

Take, for example, the sketch given us by Luke of the labors of Philip the Evangelist, one of the first who wore that designation. One  of  the  seven  ministers  of  the  Jerusalem  church,  after  his diaconate was vacated  by the dispersion of that  community, he commenced  his  evangelical  labors.  He  turned  his  face  towards Samaria, and preached and baptized amongst the Samaritans: for, we are told, when the Samaritans believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the Lord Jesus, they were  baptized,  both  men  and  women.  He  also  converted  the Ethiopian Eunuch; and then, passing from Azotus, he "preached *in all the cities* till he came to Cesarea," where he afterwards resided. The next notice we have of him is found in Acts 21:8. "We," says Luke,  "who  were  of  Paul's  company,  departed,  and  came  into Cesarea, and entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist, one of the seven, and abode with him. He had four virgin daughters that did  prophesy."  Evident,  then,  it  is  that  he  obtained  the  title *Evangelist*  from  his  itinerant  labors  in  the  gospel  and  in  the converting of men. His possession of the gift of the Holy Spirit was no more peculiar to him as an evangelist, than as deacon of the church in Jerusalem; for while in the diaconate of that church he seems to have been as full of the Holy Spirit as when visiting all the cities from Azotus to Cesarea. 

Convening  converts  into  societies,  and  organizing  them  into worshipping assemblies, are inseparably connected with the right of converting them. Casually, in his letters to Timothy, Paul seems to define the work of an Evangelist. He says, "Preach the word; be instant in season, and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching; endure affliction; *do the work of an Evangelist;* fulfil thy ministry." "Let no man despise thy youth. Till I  come  give  attendance  to  reading,  to  exhortation,  to  teaching. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, according to prophecy — by the laying on the hands of the presbytery or eldership." "Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all: take heed to thyself and to thy teaching; continue in them: for in doing this, thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee."1 This seems to be the office of an Evangelist which the Lord gave the church after his ascension. 

Setting things in order in the churches — the committing the same office to  faithful  men,  who shall  be able to  instruct  others — the ordaining of elders, and a general superintendence of the affairs of churches, seem to have been also lodged in the hands of Timothy and Titus as agents of the Apostles. How far these works are yet necessary, and how far the superintendence of them may be safely lodged  in  the  hands  of  select  Evangelists  as  *respects  infant communities,*  may  be,  with  many  a  question  of  dubious interpretation.  But  that  Evangelists  are  to  separate  into communities their own converts, teach and superintend them till they  are  in  a  condition  to  take  care  of  themselves,  is  as unquestionably a part of the office of an Evangelist as praying, or preaching, or baptizing. 

But we shall be asked, 'Is not preaching and baptizing, and even teaching,  the  common  privilege  of  all  disciples,  as  they  have opportunity?' And we also ask in answer, 'Is it not the privilege of all fathers to teach their own children, and to preside over their own  families?'  But  who  will  thence  infer,  that  all  fathers  are teachers and presidents, does not more shock common sense, than he who infers that all disciples, as such, are evangelists, pastors, and teachers, because we concede that in certain cases it is the privilege of all citizens of Christ's kingdom to preach, baptize, and teach.  Every  citizen  of  Christ's  kingdom  has,  in  virtue  of  his citizenship, equal rights, privileges and immunities. So has every citizen of the United States. Yet  all citizens are not  legislators, magistrates, judges, governors, etc. Before any community, civil or religious,  is  organized,  every  man  has  equal  rights  to  do  what seemeth good in his own eyes. But when organized, and persons appointed  to  office,  then  whatever  rights,  duties,  privileges  are conferred on particular persons, cannot of right belong to those who have transferred them; any more than a person cannot both give and keep the same thing. 

But  there  are  some  duties  and  privileges  we  cannot  wholly communicate  to  others.  Parents  cannot  wholly  transfer  the education of their children to others; neither can a master transfer all his duties to a steward or overseer. No more can the citizens of Christ's kingdom wholly transfer their duties to preach and teach Christ. To enlighten the ignorant, to persuade the unbelieving, to exhort the disobedient when they fall in our way and we have the ability  or  the  opportunity,  is  an  intransferable  duty.  Even  the church  of  Rome,  with  all  her  clerical  pride,  commands  and authorizes  *lay  baptism,*  when  a  Priest  is  not  convenient.  A Christian is by profession a preacher of truth and righteousness, both by precept and example. *He may of right preach, baptize, and dispense  the  supper,  as  well  as  pray  for  all  men,  when circumstances  demand  it.*  This  concession  does  not,  however, either dispense with the necessity of having evangelists, bishops, and deacons; not, having them, does it authorize any individual to assume  to  do  what  has  been  given  in  charge  to  them.  Liberty without licentiousness, and government without tyranny, is the true genius of the Christian institution. 

While, then, the Christian system  allows every man "as he has received a gift to minister as a good steward of the manifold grace of  God,"  it  makes  provision  for  choosing  and  setting  apart qualified persons for all its peculiar services, necessary to its own edification and comfort, as well as to its usefulness in the world. It provides for its own perpetuity and its growth in the wisest and most  practical  manner.  Its  whole  wisdom  consists  in  four points: — 1st. It establishes the necessary offices for its perpetuity and  growth.  2d.  It  selects  the  best-qualified  persons  for  those offices.  3d.  It  consecrates  or  sets  those  persons  apart  to  those offices. 4th. It commands them to give themselves wholly to the work, that their improvement may keep pace with the growth of the  body,  and  be  apparent  to  all.  Can  any  person  point  out  an imperfection in this plan? — ! 

All its officers, whether for its services at home or abroad, when fully  proved,  are  to  be  formally  and  solemnly  set  apart  by  the imposition  of  the  hands  of  the  presbytery  or  eldership  of  the church. The whole community chooses — the seniors ordain. *This is the apostolic tradition.* Let those unacquainted with the volume examine the apostolic law and usage; Acts 6:2-6. So the Christian system  in  its  elections  and  ordinations  began.  *It  is  immutable.* Therefore this system obtains in all cases. The qualifications for any office are always founded in the nature of the office. They are generally detailed, but not always, because the *work to be done* is the best guide in ascertaining the qualifications of the doer of it. 

We say the seniors of elders always ordain. Popery says, 'None but those on whom the apostolic hands have been laid can of right ordain.' *Such an idea is not in the Christian system.* The seniors always lay on hands, whether hands have been laid on them or not. This is true Protestantism. Better still, it is true Bibleism. *Nay, it is the Christian System.* The Apostles laid on hands because *seniors,* and not because *apostles.* This is the jet of a controversy of fifteen hundred  years'  standing.  It  has  been  very  generally,  almost universally  misstated  and  overlooked.  Protestants  are  as  much Papists  in  this,  as  the  Papists  are  Protestants  in  disowning Protestantism.  It  is  assumed  by  Romanists,  and  conceded  by Protestants, that "*holy hands*" are official hands by a *jure Divino.* They are sometimes, but not always. But *Christian elders,* (for I do not mean mere old men,) who have long walked in the ways of the Lord, have holy hands, and much more power with and from the Lord, then ever dwelt in any pontiff or pretended vicar of Christ, in twelve hundred and sixty years. 

In proof that seniors lay  on hands,  we appeal  to  the fact,  Acts 6:1-15 :, for the Apostles were the oldest converts in Jerusalem. We appeal also to the fact that the presbytery or eldership laid hands on Timothy, and gave him the gift or office of an evangelist. And  are  there  two  rules  of  ordination  in  one system!  Paul  and Barnabas,  though  *Apostles,*  were  themselves  ordained  by  the church  of  Antioch  by  its  presbytery.  Consequently,  *seniors  in Christ, as such,* can, of divine warrant, lay hands on any persons, for any office to which the church has elected them. It must be done also by prayer and fasting. See  Acts 6:6; Acts 13:3; Acts 14:23. 

Persons may be juniors in years and seniors in Christ. Timothy, says Paul, "*lay hands suddenly on no man.*" This implies that the ordained were juniors in the Lord; and until they had attained some character and standing as seniors, (even Timothy himself,) were not to consent to their ordination. Perhaps it may be necessary to say that classic presbytery and the presbytery of a single church are very  different  institutions.  The  Apostles  ordained  *elders*  (a presbytery) in every church. They did not make young men old, but set apart those that were seniors in the Lord to the office of overseers. They did not make juniors *seniors,* but they made elders *bishops.* 

The community, the church, the multitude of the faithful, are the fountain  of official power. This  power descends from  the body itself — not from its servants. Servants made by servants are servants of servants; and such are all the clergy of the Man of Sin. But the body of Christ, under him as its head, animated and led by his spirit, is the fountain and spring of all official power and privilege. How much surer and purer is ecclesiastic authority thus derived from Christ the head, immediately through his body, that when derived through a long, doubtful, corrupt dynasty of bishops or pontiffs! The church is the mother of all the sons and priests of God; and to look for authority to her servants or creatures, as do all sorts of Papists, whether Catholic or Protestant, is to worship and serve  the  creature  more  than  the  Creator — a  species  of  idolatry worthy only of the darkest night of the darkest day of the dark ages. 

But the church needs messengers for special occasions — not only her  stated  deacons  and  ministers,  but  ministers  extraordinary. These too are selected by the church or churches in a given district, and *commissioned by their letters.* They are not consecrated by imposition of hands, but *approved by letters* from the community. Are we asked for authority? We produce it with pleasure. 1 Cor. 16:3. is just to the point: "And," says Paul to the saints in Corinth, "when I come *whomsoever you shall approve by letters,* them will I send to bring your liberality to Jerusalem." This is the apostolic usage in such cases. In the second epistle Paul says, "We have sent Titus the brother (Luke, we opine) whose praise is in the gospel, (written  by  him,)  throughout  all  the  churches — who  was  also *chosen by the churches* to travel with us this bounty," etc. 

The  Christian  system  demands  for  its  perpetuity  and  for  its prosperity at home and abroad, bishops, deacons, and evangelists. Its bishops teach, preside, and execute the laws of Christ in all its convocations.  The  deacons,  a  large  and  diverse  class  of functionaries,  composed  of  stewards,  treasurers,  almoners, door-keepers, etc. as the case may require, wait continually upon its  various  services.  Its  evangelists,  possessed  of  proper qualifications, ordained and consecrated to the work of the Lord in converting sinners and  planting  churches, by  a presbytery, or a board of seniors competent to the prudent discharge of the duty, are  constantly  engaged  in  multiplying  its  members.  These ministers of the word are commanded to be wholly engrossed in this work, and consequently to be fully sustained by their brethren in it. They are held responsible to all the holy brethren, and to the Lord at his appearing and his kingdom, for the faithful discharge of that sacred trust confided in them. 

What  an efficient  institution is  that over which Christ presides, when well understood and fully carried out in all its details! With its bishops and deacons at home, and its evangelists abroad, wholly devoted to the faithful discharge of their respective trusts; men of experience, faith, piety, morality, full of zeal, energy, benevolence, co-operating with all similar institutions, supported by the prayers and free-will offerings of all the united people, having the love of God in their hearts, and heaven in their eye, what may they not achieve of glory to God, of good to men, and honor to themselves! Of such an army of the faith, in full operation and concert, it might indeed be asked, "Who is this that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners!"

26. The Christian Discipline 

Members should be publicly received into all societies. They are so in the state. It is matter of record. When a person is regenerated, and desires to be enrolled among the disciples meeting in any one place, if his  confession to  salvation  or immersion  has not  been publicly known to the brethren, reason says those who have been privy to the fact, who can attest his confession, ought to introduce him to the congregation, and he ought to be saluted or received as such  by  the  brethren  with  whom  he  unites.  This  the  slightest attention to propriety, the reason and nature of things, fully and satisfactorily  demonstrate.  Letters  of  recommendation  are  the expedient which, in apostolic times, was substituted for this formal introduction, when a citizen of the kingdom visited any community where he was unknown personally to the brethren. 

A person cannot be under the oversight or under the discipline of a congregation,  unless  he  voluntarily  associate  with  the  brethren meeting in that place, and unless it be a matter of notoriety or of record among the brethren that he is one of them. There can be no formal exclusion if there be no formal reception. If there be no visible  and  formal  union,  there  can  be  no  visible  and  formal separation. In truth, there can be no discipline in any congregation, unless  it  be  an  organized  body;  and  no  body  can  be  organized unless it is known who are members of it. On a matter of such plain  common  sense  perception  we  have  seldom  thought  it necessary to say a word, and should not now have noticed it at all, had  we  not  found  some  societies  which  cannot  tell  their  own members, which  even hesitated about  the necessity of a  formal reception of any person into them, or of having it on record who belonged  to  them.  They  demanded  a  positive  commandment  or precedent  for  such  a  reception.  They  might  as  pertinently  have demanded  a  positive  commandment  for  persons  to  be  formally married before they could be recognized as husband and wife, as to ask  for  a  positive  commandment  for  one  of  the  most  common dictates of reason, though, indeed, every commandment addressed to  the Christian congregations  on  relative duties and privileges, assumes the principle that those who belong to  any society are known  to  each  other  to  belong  to  it,  else  they  could  not  even perform the first day to one another — they could not know when they were assembled — they could not "tarry for one another." 

Whether  there  shall  be  a  record  in  print,  in  writing,  or  on  the memory of all the congregation, is a question which must depend on circumstances. If all the members are blessed with infallible memories,  so  as  never  to  forget  who  are  members,  when  they became  such,  when  any  one  was  received,  when  any  one  was rejected — I say, if every brother and sister can so well remember these matters, as, when the discipline of the congregation or any particular  question  respecting  any  case  of  discipline  may  arise, they can infallibly remember all about it; then, and in that case, it is  unnecessary  to  have  any  record,  church  book,  secretary,  or anything  written  or  printed.  But  if  otherwise,  there  must  be  a record;  because  questions  involving  peace  and  good  order  of society  may  arise,  and  have  arisen,  which  require  infallible testimony, or the most satisfactory evidence on questions of fact; such as, Was A B ever a member of your community? When did he become a member of it? When was he excluded? When was he restored? When did he forsake the assembly of the brethren? Was he a husband at the time of his removal? etc.  

Two things are paramount in all cases of discipline before brought into the congregation — *the Fact and the Law.* The fact is always to be  established  by  good  testimony  or  by  the  confession  of  the transgressor. The thing said to have been done, or the fact being established, the next question is, *What is the law in the case?* The president of the congregation states the fact proved, and lays the law before the brethren. They are to be judges both of the fact and the law, and when both are clearly propounded the questions is put. The congregation decides. — This is the oracle of reason — of civil law in all civilized countries; and it is the oracle of the Savior and his Apostles. Private offences, public offences, and those that are mixed, are to be decided according to what is written in the Book. This  must  be  known;  therefore,  after  the  formation  of  a congregation,  the  first  lessons  to  be  learned  are  those  which concern the relative duties of the brethren; and discipline amongst these first lessons stand conspicuous. It is too late to have to learn the law after a case occurs. When there are no cases of discipline in a congregation, then is the time for the brethren to be taught the will  of  the  Lawgiver,  that  they  may  be  prepared  to  act  with promptness and prudence when required. 

"Offences must come;" and, if possible, they must be healed. To cut off an offender, is good; to cure him, is better; but to prevent him falling, is best of all. The Christian spirit and system alike inculcate  vigilance  in  preventing;  all  expedition  in  healing offences; and all firmness in removing incorrigible offenders. Its disciplinary code is exceedingly simple, rational, and benevolent. It teaches us to regard all offences as acts of impiety, or acts of immorality; sins against our brethren, or sins against God alone; the omission of right, or the commission of wrong. 

Trespasses against our brethren are all matters of aggression upon their  persons,  property,  or  character.  They  are  either  private  or public. We can only offend against the person, the property, or the character  of  a  brother;  and  we  can  do  this  only  privately  or publicly.  Christ's  legislation  on  private  or  personal  offences,  as recorded in the 18th chapter of Matthew, commends itself to the approbation of Jew and Gentile all over the world. It is as plain and as excellent as his golden rule of moral feeling. 

Without giving any rules to decide who is the aggressor, or the aggrieved, allowing either of the parties to view the matter as he pleases, he commands him that supposes himself to be aggrieved to go to the aggressor and tell him his fault privately. If restitution is  made  and  reconciliation  effected,  the  matter  ends.  If  not,  he takes with him a second or a third person, states the facts of the case,  reasons  and  remonstrates.  If  this  also  fails,  then  he  is commanded  to  inform  the  church  of  the  matter;  and  if  the aggressor will not hear the church, then he is to be as a heathen man or a publican. 

Some, indeed, imagine a difficulty in this case; for after "*tell*" there is  no  *it*  in  the  original;  and  ask,  '*What  is  to  be  told  to  the church — the original fault,* or *simply that the aggressor will not make restitution?*' The most natural construction of the sentence favors the simple statement of the fact — that an offence had been committed and restitution refused, without going into the details of the trespass. But  a second difficulty has been suggested on the manner in which the congregation is to be informed. Is it to be told to  the  whole  community  in  full  assembly  met?  or  to  those appointed by the congregation to hear and adjudicate such matters? Certainly the congregation has ears as well as a tongue, and it is not all ears nor all tongue. Every well-organized church has its eldership, who hear all such matters, and who bring them before the whole assembly only when it is absolutely necessary, and even then at a convenient season. 

The elders hear the matter; and if the case be one that requires a special committee, which Paul calls "secular seats of judicature," 1 Cor. 6:4. they appoint it; then, and not till then, if their decision of the matter be refused, they bring it before the whole congregation, and he is excluded from among them, that he may be as a heathen man and a publican — one entitled only to civil, and not to Christian respect — one whose company is to be eschewed rather than courted. 

The whole community can act, and ought to act, in receiving and in excluding  persons:  but  in  the  aggregate,  it  can  never  become judges  of  offences  and  a  tribunal  trial.  Such  an  institution  was never set up by divine authority. No community is composed only of  wise  and  discreet  full  grown  men.  The  Christian  church engrosses old men, young men, and babes in Christ. Shall the voice of a babe be heard, or counted as a vote in a case of discipline! What is the use of bishops in a church, if all are to rule — of judges, if  all  are  judges  of  fact  and  law!  No  wonder  that  broils  and heart-burnings, and scandals of all sorts disturb these communities ruled by a democracy of the whole — where every thing is to be judged  in  public  and  full  assembly.  Such  is  not  the  Christian system. It ordains that certain persons shall judge and rule,1 and 

that all things shall "be done decently and in order." 

Besides  matters  of  private  trespass  between  brethren,  there  are matters of public wrong, or acts of injustice towards the whole Christian  community,  and  also  towards  them  that  are  without. Drunkenness in a professor, for example, is a sin against God and against  all  the  Christian  brotherhood.  It  is,  moreover,  a  public nuisance  to  all  men,  so  far  as  it  is  witnessed  or  known.  The transgressor in such a case, if he be not penitent and reform, must be convicted of the offence. An attempt at convicting him of the offence is not to be made till he fail to acknowledge it. A failure to acknowledge,  or  an  attempt  to  deny,  calls  for  conviction,  and precludes the idea of repentance. 

In all cases of conviction the church is to be addressed through its rulers.  No  private  individual  has  a  right  to  accuse  any  person before  the  whole  community.  The  charge,  in  no  case,  is  to  be preferred  before  the  whole  congregation.  Such  a  procedure  is without  precedent  in  the  Law  or  in  the  Gospel — in  any  well regulated society, church, or state. If, then, any brother fall into any public offence, those privy to it notify the elders of the church, or those for the time being presiding over it, of the fact, and of the evidence on which they rely. The matter is then in the hands of the proper persons. They prosecute the investigation of it; and on the denial of the accused, seek to convict him of the allegation. 

When a person is convicted of any offence, he is unworthy of the confidence of the brethren; for conviction supposes concealment and denial; and these, of course, are evidence of impenitence. We do not say that such a one is never again to be worthy of such confidence;  but  that  until  he  has  given  satisfactory  proofs  of genuine repentance, he is to be treated as one not of the body of Christ. 

In all case of hopeful repentance the transgressor is to be restored with  admonition.  The  acknowledgment  of  an  offence,  and  of repentance for it, are, in all cases, to be as public as the sin itself. Peter's  sin  and  repentance  are  as  public  as  his  name.  So  was David's. So should be those of all transgressors. Those who have caused  the  Savior  and  his  faithful  followers  to  blush,  ought themselves  to  be  made  to  blush  before  the  world;  and  if  their sorrow and amendment be genuine, they will do it cheerfully and fully. "Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear." 1 Tim. 5:20.2 

On  the  subject  of  *exclusion,*  or  what  is  commonly  called *excommunication,* which places the subject of it in the attitude of a pagan  or  publican  to  the  whole  Christian  community,  all  the Protestant sects seem to be of one mind. The Baptist Discipline, appended to the Confession of Faith taken from the works of Dr. John  Owen,  Dr.  Goodwin,  and  other  Congregationalists  and Independents, speaks in full harmony with our views — 9th edition, 1798, p. 20. — "The manner of proceeding unto this great and awful instituted  ordinance,  is,  the  church  being  gathered  together,  the offender  also  having  notice  to  come  to  make  his  answer  and defence (if he comes not, he aggravates his offence by despising the authority of Christ in his church) the body of the church is to have knowledge of the offender's crime fully, and the full proof thereof  as  of  plain  matter  of  fact;  and  after  mature  deliberate consideration, and consulting the rules of direction given in the word  of  God,  whether  the  offender  be  present  or  absent,  the minister or elder puts the question to the whole church, whether they judge the person guilty of crime now proved upon him, is worthy of the censure of the church for the same? To which the members  in  general  give  their  judgment;  which,  it  be  in  the affirmative, then the judgment of the members in general being had, or the majority of them, the pastor, minister, or elder, sums up the sentence of the church, opens the nature of the crime, with the suitableness of the censure, according to gospel rule; and having thus  proceeded,  a  proper  time  is  fixed  to  put  the  sentence  in execution;  at  which  time  the  pastor,  minister,  or  elder  of  the church,  as  his  place  and  duty  require,  is  to  lay  open  the heinousness of such a sin, with all the aggravating circumstances thereof, and showing what an abominable scandal such an offender is become to religion, what dishonor it is to God, etc. applying the particular places of scripture that are proper to the case, in order to charge the offence home upon the conscience of the offender, if present, that others also may fear; showing also the awful nature of this great censure, and the main end thereof, for the salvation and not the destruction of the soul, and with much solemnity in the whole society, calling upon God for his gracious presence, and his blessing upon this his sacred ordinance, that the great end thereof may be obtained. Still expressing the deep sense the church hath of the fall of this brother, with the great humiliation of the church, and great sorrow for, and detestation of, the sin committed. The said pastor, minister, or elder, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of the congregation, and by and with the consent, and according to the judicial sentence of the church, cuts off, and secludes  such  an  offender  by  name,  both  from  the  union  and communion of the church, because of his offences; so that such a person is not thenceforth to be looked on, deemed, or accounted as a brother or member of such a church, until God shall restore him again by repentance." 

Whether it may be always prudent in the incipient stages of every case of discipline to have open doors, or whether some cases may not require closed doors, are questions referred to human prudence; but in the case of the ultimate decision of the congregation, and in that of exclusion, there can be but one opinion on the necessity and utility of its being done in the presence of all who may please to attend. 

1 1 Tim. 3:5; 1 Tim. 5:17. Acts 20:28-31. Heb. 13:17, etc. etc.

27. Expediency 

"All  things  lawful  are  not  expedient,  because  all  things  lawful edify not." So Paul substantially affirmed. A position of licentious tendency,  if  not  well  qualified.  As  defined  by  its  author,  it  is perfectly safe. He only assumed that there were manythings which he might lawfully do, which were not *expedient* for him to do. He might, for example, have married a wife, eat the flesh of either Jewish or Pagan sacrifices, or drunk the wine of their libations, etc. etc. according to the Christian law; but in the circumstances of his peculiar vocation and localities, to have done these things would have been inexpedient.  

Law itself is, indeed, at best but an expedient — a means, supposed at the time of its promulgation, suitable to some rational end. But, owing to the mutability of things, laws often fail to be the best means to the ends proposed; and are therefore abolished, or, for the time  being,  suspended.  This  is  true  of  all  laws  and  institutions prescribing the *modes* and *forms* of action, whether in religion or morality. Moral laws, properly so called, are, indeed, immutable; because the principle of every moral law is *love,* and that never can cease to be not only a way and means, but the *only way and means,* to  rational,  to  human  happiness.  Positive  precepts,  however, prescribing  the  *forms*  of  religious  and  moral  action,  emanating from God himself, have been changed, and may again be changed, while  all  the  elements  of  piety  and  morality  are  immutable.  It would now, for example, be immoral to marry a natural sister; yet it was for a time done by divine authority. It became inexpedient to continue the practice, and the law was changed. 

There is, therefore, *a law of expediency,* as well as the expediency of law. This law of expediency, as it is, indeed, the basis of the expediency of law in the divine government, has been, as in the case of David eating the loaves of the presence, and the priests profaning the Sabbath by the labors of the Temple, occasionally elevated above the precepts that prescribe the forms of religious and moral action. True, indeed, that such cases are exceedingly rare; and they are rare reasoners who can safely decide when any particular precept prescribing the *form* of action, may, for the sake of  the  action  itself,  be  waived  or  suspended.  It  is,  moreover, exceedingly  questionable,  whether,  under  the  more  perfect institution of Christianity, the law of expediency can ever clash with any moral or religious precept in the New Covenant. 

Still there are manythings left to the law of expediency, concerning which no precepts are found in the apostolic writings. To ascertain these is the object of this chapter. They are, then, in one sentence, those  things,  or  forms  of  action,  which  it  was  impossible  or unnecessary to reduce to special precepts; consequently they are not faith, piety, nor morality; because whatever is of the faith, of the worship, or of the morality of Christianity, was both possible and  necessary  to  be  promulged;  and  is  expressly  and  fully propounded in the sacred scriptures. The laws of expediency, then, has no place in determining the articles of faith, acts of worship, nor principles of morality. All these require a "*thus saith the Lord*" in express statements, and the sacred writings have clearly defined and  decided  them.  But  in  other  matters  that  may  be  called  the circumstantials  of  the  gospel  and  of  the  church  of  Christ,  the people of God are left to their own discretion and to the facilities and exigencies of society. 

Manythings, indeed, that are of vital importance to the well-being and prosperity of the kingdom  of Christ, are left to  the law of expediency. A few examples will suffice: — Can any one imagine any measure of more consequence than the safe-keeping of the apostolic writings, the multiplication of copies, the translation of them into different languages, and the mode of distributing them throughout the whole world? Now, who can show a positive or special precept on any one of these four vital points? Scribes or copyists, paper-makers, printers, book-binders, and venders of the oracles of God, are as unknown to the apostolic writers as mails, post-offices, rail-roads, and steam-engines. So negligent, too, has the kingdom of Christ been on some of these points, that she has not  at  this  hour  a  *received  copy*  of  the  Living  Oracles.  We American and English people have a *received version* by authority of a king; but we have not a **received original** by the authority of any king or government civil or ecclesiastic. A startling fact, truly! But who dares to deny it? 

Next to these are meeting-houses, baptisteries, Lord's tables, the emblematic loaf and cup, times of convocation, arrangements for the  day,  etc.  etc.  Acts  of  Parliament,  decrees  of  synods  and councils, but no apostolic enactments, statutes, or laws, are found for  any  of  these  important  items.  There  is  neither  precept  nor precedent in the New Testament for building, hiring, buying, or possessing a meeting-house; for erecting a baptismal bason, font, or bath; for chancel, altar, table, leavened or unleavened bread, chalice, cup, or tankard, and many other things of equal value. 

There is no law, rule, or precedent for the *manner* of eating the Lord's supper, no hint as the quantity of bread and wine to be used by each participant; nothing said about who shall partake first, or how  it  shall  be  conveyed  from  one  to  another.  These  are  all discretionary matters, and left to the prudence and good sense of the  Christian  communities — in  other  words,  to  the  law  of expediency. 

Touching  these  and  very  many  other  such  matters  and  things, nothing is enacted, prescribed, or decided by apostolic authority; but all the things to be done are enjoined in the very clear and broad precepts, or in very striking and clear apostolic precedents. General laws and precepts, embracing the whole range of religious and moral action, are often found in the sayings of the Lord and his ministers of the New Institution, from which also our duties and obligations  may  be  clearly  ascertained.  That  "marriage  is honorable in all" is clearly taught; but who ever read a verse on the *manner* in which the most important of all social institutions is to be performed? No age is fixed at which the covenant shall be made or  ratified — on  time  of  life  prescribed  for  its consummation — nothing said about who shall perform the service, the formula, the witnesses, the record, etc. And, still more singular, there is no table, no law, or statute in all the New Covenant saying who may, or who may not, enter into that relation on any principle of consanguinity or affinity. By the consent of the Christian church the Jewish law obtains in this matter. 

The  communion  of  saints,  of  all  Christian  churches — the co-operation of churches as one holy nation, a kingdom of priests, as  a  peculiar  people  in  all  common  interests  and  benefits — an efficient  gospel ministry, supported justly and honorably by the whole  community — are  matters  clearly  and  fully  taught  by  both apostolic precept and authority; but the forms, the ways and means by  which  these  ends  shall  be  attained,  are  left  to  the  law  of expediency. 

But here arises a practical and all-important question, viz. — *Who shall ascertain and who shall interpret this law of expediency?* We all agree that expedients are to be chosen with regard to times, seasons, and other circumstances. Changes in these must always change expedients. The mariner's compass, the art of printing, new modes of travelling, Banks and their commercial operations, new forms of government, etc. etc. have changed the order of society and all human expedients. Now the law of expediency is the law of adopting the best present means of attaining any given end. But this is a matter which the wisdom and good sense of individuals and communities must decide. This is not, this cannot be, a matter of standing revelation. Now if the church was always unanimous in opinion  as  in  faith — if  all  the  accumulated  wisdom  gave  one uniform decision on all such questions, then the whole church is by one voice to ascertain the law of expediency on any given point. But  this  is  not  the  case.  No  class  of  men — apostles,  teachers, privates,  ever  did  agree  on  questions  of  expediency.  Paul  and Barnabas  dissented  and  differed,  *without  any  breach  of communion,* on a question of this sort. Hence arises the necessity of  the  spirit  of  concession,  subordination,  bearing,  forbearing submitting to one another. When there are two views or opinions on any question of expediency entertained by two parties, one of them must yield, or there are two distinct systems of operation, and ultimately two distinct parties. According to the law of expediency, then, the minors in age, experience, or numbers, must give place to the majors in  age, experience, or numbers. But as numbers are supposed to represent the ratios of age, wisdom, and knowledge, it is  expedient  that  a  clearly  ascertained  majority  of  those  whose province  it  is  to  decide  any  matter,  shall  interpret  the  law  of expediency; or, in other words, the minority shall peaceably and cordially acquiesce in the decisions of the majority. Since the age of  social  compacts  began  till  now,  no  other  principle  of co-operation, no other law of expediency, can secure the interests, the union, harmony, and strength of any people, but that of the few submitting to the many. 

He that asks of unanimity asks for what is not often attainable in a small number of persons. He asks for the liberty of one or two to govern or to control a whole community — for the government of a minority, however small, over a majority, however large. This is virtually,  though  not  formally,  and  not  often  intentionally,  the demand  of  all  the  advocates  of  unanimity  in  ascertaining  or interpreting the law of expediency in any given case. The law of expediency enacts that a majority of the seniors shall decide in all cases what is most expedient to be done in attaining any of the ends commanded in the Christian Institution, the means to which are not divinely ordained in the written laws of that institution; and that the minority shall cheerfully and conscientiously acquiesce in such decisions. 

*The  law  of  love  is  the  supreme  law  of  religion,  morality,  and expediency. No code of laws, without it, could make or keep any people pure, peaceable, and happy; and, with it, we only want, in most matters, but general laws.* — This is the spirit, and soul, and body of the Christian Institution. We cannot love by law, but we can walk in love with no other law but that of love. The Christian system contemplates love as supreme, and makes no arrangements nor  provisions  for  keeping  together  a  carnal,  worldly,  selfish, self-willed population. Better such a confederacy had burst into as many particles as persons, by the repellent principle of selfishness, than to be hooped together by all the laws of expediency from Noah to John Wesley. 

28. Heresy 

Schisms  and  heresies  are  matters  strongly  reprobated  in  the Christian Scriptures. That they may be guarded against with due care, they must be contemplated and understood in their true and proper  scriptural  attributes.  We  shall  therefore  first  attempt  to define them. 

The term *schism* is found but *eight* times in the apostolic writings. When applied to a garment, Matt. 9:16. Mark 2:21. it is properly translated *rent;* applied to a concourse of people, John 7:43; 9:16; 10:19, it is translated *division;* when applied to the church by Paul, 1 Cor. 1:10; 11:18; 12:25. it denotes *division* or *alienation* — not on account of faith, doctrines, or opinions — but on account of men as leaders or chiefs among the brethren. So the connections in which it is found always  indicate.  It  is  a division  as  respects  *internal union,* or the union of heart and affection, only tending to a breach of  visible  or  outward  union,  and  therefore  reprobated  by  the Apostle. Such are its New Testament acceptations. 

Schisms may then exist where there is the most perfect agreement in faith, in doctrine, in all religious tenets. Undue attachment to certain  persons,  to  the  disparagement  of  others,  partial  regards because of personal preferences, are the true elements of schism or division as it appeared in Corinth, and as the word is used in the New  Testament.  But  few  persons,  now-a-days,  can  correctly appreciate  the  force  of  the  word  *schisms*  in  the  apostolic  age, because but a very few experimentally know the intimacies, the oneness  of  heart  and  soul,  that  obtained  and  prevailed  in  the Christian profession, while all was genuine and uncorrupt. A union formed on Christian principles — a union with Christ and his people, in  views,  sentiments,  feelings,  aims,  and  pursuits — a  real co-partnery for eternity, almost annihilated individuality itself, and inseparably cemented into one spirit all the genuine members of Christ's body. Kindred drops do not more readily mingle into one mass, than flowed the souls of primitive Christians together in all their  aspirations,  loves,  delights,  and  interests.  Hence  arose  the jealousy in the Apostle Paul when first he learned that particular persons  in  Corinth  began  to  attract  to  themselves  notice  and attachment  for  mere  personal,  individual,  and  fleshly considerations, as leaders or chiefs in the Christian family. In these indications he already saw the dissolution of the church. Although yet but one visible community, having one Lord, one faith, one baptism,  one  table,  one  ostensible  supreme  and  all-controlling interest; still, in these attachments to particular persons he not only saw  a  real  division  or  breach  in  the  hearts  of  the  people,  but foresaw that it would issue in positive, actual, and visible disunion or heresy. And here we are led to inquire into the scriptural import of the word *heresy.* 

*Hairesis,*  strictly  and  literally  indicative  of  *choice*  or  *option,*  is anglicised *heresy,* and properly rendered *sect* or *faction,* and by implication *discord* and *contention.* It is found only *nine* times in the New Testament. In the Acts 5: 17, we have it rendered "the sect of the Sadducees;"—Acts 15:5 "the sect of the Pharisees;"—Acts 24:5,  "the  sect  of  the  Nazarenes;"—Acts  24:14,  "after  the  way which they call *heresy* (sect,) so worship I," says Paul; — Acts 26:5, "after the most strict *sect* of our religion I lived a Pharisee;"—Acts 28:22.  "as  for  this  *sect*  (of  the  Christians)  we  know  that  it  is everywhere spoken against." Besides these six occurrences we find it twice used by Paul in his epistles, and once by Peter. 1 Cor. 11:19. "For there must be *heresies* (sects) among you." Gal. 5:20. "Sedition,  heresies."  2  Peter  2:1.  "Shall  bring  in  damnable heresies." In the common version it is, then, five times rendered *sect,* and four times *heresy.* 

As the word *sect* or *heresy,* found only in the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles, does not always in the former simply mean a *party,* without any regard to its tenets, the term has nothing in it either reproachful or honorable — nothing virtuous or vicious. Hence it is equally applied to Pharisees, Sadducees, Nazarenes, or Christians, without any insinuation as the character of the party. It is only once rendered  *heresy*  in  the  "Acts,"  and  in  that  place  it  ought  most obviously to have been *sect.* Paul had been accused by Tertullus (Acts 24:6.) with the crime of being "a ringleader of the *sect* of the Nazarenes." Now in vindicating himself from any censure in this case, he ought to have met the charge under the same title. This he did in the original; for in verse 5th, in the indictment, and in verse 14th,  in  his  defence,  we  have  the  same  word  *hairesis.*  How injudicious,  then,  was  it  on  the  part  of  our  translators  and  the Vulgate to make Tertullus accuse Paul of a *sect,* and to make Paul defend himself of a *heresy,* when both Tertullus and Paul used the same word in their speeches as reported by Luke in the original! 

In the new version this word is, as it should be, uniformly rendered *sect.* In the Epistles, and apparently once in  Acts, it is used as though it included an idea of censure or guilt. Paul defends himself from  the  accusation  of  Tertullus.  Here,  then,  a  question arises — "Why  should  the  term  *hairesis*  import  blame  in  its *Christian,* and none in its *Jewish* acception! We answer, Because among  the  Jews  sects  or  parties  did  not  terminate  as  among Christians,  in  separate  communities  or  communions.  They resembled  the  high  and  low  church  parties  in  the  Episcopalian communion;  or  the  different  and  numerous  sects  among  the Romanists,  viz. — Benedictines,  Franciscans,  Dominicans,  Jesuits, etc.  which  never  terminate  in  a  breach  of  communion  or co-operation  as  one  church.  Thus  the  Pharisees,  Sadducees, Herodians, etc. frequented the same temple, altar, priesthood, and united  in  all  the  same  acts  of  worship.  Not  so  the  Jews  and Samaritans:  they  were  real  *sects*  in  the  Christian  sense.  Again, among the Jews the bond of union was national and fleshly; and, therefore, parties could not destroy it. With us it is spiritual, social, cordial — one faith, one hope, one spirit; and parties are destructive in the superlative degree. 

To this view there is but one plausible objection; and that we meet in the answer to the question, '*Why did Paul defend himself from the accusation of Tertullus as indicating censure, if sects among the Jews were such harmless and inoffensive things?*' We answer, There is no blame in the simple imputation of a sect, but in the ideas which Tertullus connected with it. The Romans had agreed to protect the Jews in the enjoyment of their religion, and they wished in the presence of Felix to make Paul appear an apostate from that religion — "a pestilent fellow, a mover of *sedition,* a ringleader of the  sect  of  the  Nazarenes" — that  he  might  be  from  under  the protection granted to the Jews' religion. From this view only can we see the wisdom of  Paul's  defence. He admits the charge of being a *sectary,* but in no criminal sense — worshipping the same God  with  them,  believing  also  every  word  in  their  law  and Prophets,  and  cherishing  the  same  hope  of  a  future  life  in  the resurrection of the dead; and thus evinces that nothing offensive or criminal  could  be  imputed  to  him  on  account  of  his  being  a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. 

In the Christian epistles it is, however, used in a bad sense, and is always connected with censure. This may have been the reason why King James' version changes the translation into *heresies,* or as  in  the  case  of  *baptism,  bishop,*  etc.  anglicises  rather  than translates the word. It is not, however, a good or sufficient reason, because it necessarily imposes upon the English reader that *heresy* in the epistles, and *sect* in the Acts of the Apostles, are two distinct and different things; and this, of course, not only obscures those passages,  but  also  prevents  the  clear  intelligence  of  a  matter essential to our duty and our happiness. The acceptation, however, is not materially different in the epistles, except in the relation of things. When the word *sect* is connected with a proper name, such as the *sect* of the Pharisees, the *sect* of the Sadducees, or the *sect* of the Christians, it is used in a middle sense, neither as intimating truth or error, good or evil; but if it be applied to a party formed in a  community  which  admits  of  no  division  or subdivision  in  its nature,  because  necessarily  tending  to  its  corruption  and destruction; then, in that relation and sense, a sect is a destructive and condemnable thing. Now in the Epistles it is always taken in this sense, and is  ranked with  *factions,*  as a work of the flesh, carnal and destructive, and doomed to the judgments of Heaven. 

Still, in its scriptural application, whether used by Luke, Paul, or Peter and it is found in no other writer, it never relates to doctrine, tenet, opinion, or faith. There is not, in sacred usage, any *tenet,* or *doctrine,* which is called *heresy* or *sect.* Hence that ecclesiastical definition, viz. — "*Heresy denotes some erroneous opinion, tenet, or doctrine obstinately persisted in,*" is without any countenance from the New Testament. *Heresy* and *heretical,* in the lips of Paul and Peter,  and  in  the  lips  of  an  ancient  or  modern  schoolman,  or churchman, are to very different things.  

But some allege that any doctrine that makes division is heretical, and therefore condemnable. It may be admitted, for the sake of argument,  that  any  doctrine  or  action  that  makes  division  is heretical or divisive; but on this account it is not condemnable; because in that sense Jesus Christ was a heretic and his gospel heresy: for he came to make divisions on earth, and did make a sect; and of course, his doctrine is divisive or heretical. 

Now if we say Jesus was a *heretic,* and his gospel *heresy,* and his followers *sectaries,* does not this divest the word of any bad or culpable significance, and make both heretics, heresies, and sects innocent things! It does, so far as all without Christ's kingdom or institution are concerned. But this is the all-important difference in this place; Christians, contradistinguished from Jews, Mussulmen, Pagans, Infidels, are lawfully, righteously, and innocently a sect, a heresy: but a sect among these is corrupt, treasonable, and most reprehensible, according to every precept, doctrine, and saying of the New Institution. Thus a man may be a Christian, or of the sect of the Nazarenes, but not a Lutheran, a Calvinist, an Arminian, without blame. 

The words *schisms* and *heresy* so far explained, may we not regard schism as the cause, and heresy as the effect? or, in other words, must we not regard sects as the effects of schisms? The philosophy of  the  whole  matter,  then,  is,  that  separation  is  the  effect  of alienation of heart, alienation the fruit of rival attachments, which in the church generally begin in personal sympathies or personal antipathies, and end in detaching the subjects of them from the body of Christ. In this view of the matter Paul seems to reason, 1 Cor. 11:18-19. — "There are *schisms* among you — for there must be *sects* among you, that the approved may be made manifest." The schisms  in  Corinth  began  in  particular  predilections  for  great teachers;  such  as  Paul,  Apollos,  Cephas.  These  preferences violated that *unity of spirit,* that oneness of heart essential to one body in Christ; and that led to parties in the church, displayed in the manner they celebrated the supper. The same spirit in other communities ultimately led to visible separations and distinct sects, as among the professed members of Christ's body at the present day. 

Paul, in commenting on this most ancient schism, further observes, that there *must,* of necessity, be sects in such a state of things, that "the *approved* may be made manifest." So true it is that all strifes, contentions, parties, and sects grow out of corruption. Sects are the egress  of  corruptions.  The  approved  hold  to  Christ,  and  thus become manifest; the disapproved follow human leaders, and are also made manifest. There appears no other cure for a corrupt and mixed  community  than  heresies  or  sects.  It  is  as  wise  and benevolent  a  provision  in  a  remedial  system,  that  incurable corruption should work out in this way, as that law in the animal kingdom which forces to the surface all unfriendly humors, and congregates into swellings and biles those vicious particles which would otherwise vitiate the whole system, and fatally terminate in the ruin of the body. 

Men, indeed, do not fall in love with Paul, Peter, and Cephas, in the partizan sense, till they have lost some of their love for Christ. Hence  the  first  indication  of  personal  regards,  or  of  sectarian attachment,  is  the  first  proof  of  declension,  backsliding,  or apostasy. The partizan attachment is of the essence of the first sin, and carries deeply concealed in its core the first element of hatred. Thus  we  observe  that  he  loves  that  Wesley  for  any  sectarian attribute, hates Calvin just in ratio of his attachment to his leader; as  he  who  loves  Calvin  for  his  humanisms  hates  Wesley  for opposing them. While he that loves only what is Christian in the two,  in  no  sense  hates  either;  but  grieves  for  the  errors  and delinquencies  of  both.  If  for  no  other  reason,  we  ought  most devoutly and ardently to eschew partyism; for this it ought to be abjured, viz. — that our hatred of one party will always be in the ratio of our love for its antagonist; and in all such cases both our love and our hatred are obnoxious to the reprobation of God, and lie, indeed, under the doom of his express condemnation. 

On this account we presume it is that the next place we find this word *hairesis,* and the only time it is again found in Paul's epistles, it stands immediately after "*factions*" and before "*envyings*" and "*murders,*" in Paul's enumeration and classification of the works of the flesh, Gal. 5:20-21. the perpetrators of which Paul strongly and repeatedly affirmed, shall not "enter into the kingdom of God." He says,  "The  works  of  the  flesh  are  manifest,  which  are these — fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, sorcery, enmities, strifes,  emulations,  wraths,  brawlings,  *factions,  sects,*  envyings, murders, intoxication," etc. etc. Every sectary is, then, Paul being in the chair of judgment, a fleshly man, and without the precincts of the kingdom of God. A severe judgment, truly! How shall we understand it? — ! 

It is now still more evident that *heresies* are not mere opinions, tenets, doctrines, or theories; for who will affirm that opinions, tenets, or theories, as such, are works of the flesh? Or who will say that fleshly principles are the roots or reasons of mere opinions, tenets, or theories, etc.? Corrupt opinions, indeed, may be more naturally  propagated  or  received  by  corrupt  men;  but  to  make opinions or tenets, even those sectarian opinions on which some parties  are  founded,  works  of  the  flesh,  is  to  confound  mental imbecility or a defective education, with depravity of heart; for nothing can be called a work of the flesh that partakes not of the corruptions of the heart. *Hairesis* in this place, then, means sects, as it always does in the New Testament. 

Still the question recurs, Are all religious sects works of the flesh? Paul  makes  no  exceptions.  We  dare  not.  He  speaks  not  of philosophic, political, or foreign factions and sects; but of those appertaining  to  the  Christian  institution.  Among  the  Jews  Paul himself  was  a  *Pharisee;*  among  the  political  castes  he  was  a *Roman;*  but  in  religion  he  was  a  Christian;  not  a  Calvinist, Arminian, or Methodist; but a Christian. Indeed, Paul himself, in his history of sectaries, or of the founders and makers of religious parties, traces all their zeal and effort to the stomach, rather than to the conscience, or love of truth. "Mark them," says he, "who cause divisions and offences  contrary to  the doctrine which  you have received, and avoid them; for such persons do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own *belly;* and by flattery and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple." Surely such sectaries and sects are "the works of the flesh." 

But here we ought to define a *factionist* and a *sectary,* since now a days we have some sectarians that are not factionists, and some factionists  and  factions  that  are  more  than  mere  sectaries.  The factionist, or as Paul calls him, the "heretic," makes the faction. The faction are those who take part with him. While the ordinary sectaries are those who are simply led by the heretic, beguiled by his  flatteries  and  fair  speeches,  without  any  sinister  motive impelling  their  course.  There  are  many  sectarians  who,  in  the simplicity of their hearts, imagine their party to be the true and only church of Christ, and therefore conscientiously adhere to it. There are others who think that no party is the church of Christ, but that he has a church in all parties — an invisible church — to which they think themselves to belong, and therefore fraternize with all of a similar stamp in all parties so far as known to them. These differ much from the schismatics, heretics, and factionists of Paul. Those either made, or labored to keep up, a party or a sect; and all such persons are corrupt fleshly men; because, from pride of their own opinion, from emulation, ambition, or the love of money, they are prompted to create or to keep up a faction or sect favorable to their views  and  interests.  These  serve  their  own  appetites  and  mind earthly things. But a great mass of sectaries are following, as they imagine, Jesus Christ and his Apostles, under the name and tenets of Luther, Calvin, Wesley, etc. They are, without knowing it, the mere followers of men: for they examine nothing for themselves by a constant and habitual reference to the Bible. 

Now, what may be the amount of carnality and fleshly or worldly influence that keeps them there, and what may be the amount of long-suffering  and  forgiveness  exercised  towards  them  from heaven, I presume not to dogmatize; but that the factionist — the person who makes a party, and he who labors to keep it up, are certainly earthly, sensual, and demoniacal; and, as such, not of the kingdom of God, we cannot but assert as a conviction deep and rational, derived from the most impartial examination of the sacred scriptures — from the clearest and most ample testimony of the Holy Spirit, speaking to us in the words of Prophets and Apostles. 

The Christian party are "built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, and on Jesus the Messiah, himself the chief corner stone,"  and  therefore  *on  the  Christian  Scriptures  alone;*  not, indeed,  as  contradistinguished  from  the  Jewish,  but  as  the development and full revelation of all that concerns Christ and his kingdom contained in those scriptures. Now, all other parties that are in  any  way diverse from  the Christian party  are built  upon some  alloy — some  creed,  formula,  or  human  institution supplementary  to  the  apostolic  laws  and  customs.  This  alloy  is what makes the party. So many items of the Apostles' doctrine and so many notions of Calvin combined produce the compound called Calvinism. So many items of Luther's opinions, compounded with the Apostles' teaching, make Lutheranism. And so many portions of Wesley's speculations, compounded with certain portions of the New  Testament,  make  the  compound  called  Methodism.  The Christian ingredients in these compounds, so far as they are not neutralized by the human alloy, make the Christians among them; while the alloy makes the sectary. Take away all that belongs to the founder of the sect in all these parties, and they would certainly coalesce and form one community. 

Now, we do not suppose that there is the same guilt in forming a new  Protestant  party  that  there  was  in  first  of  all  forming  the Roman  Catholic,  the  Greek,  or  any  of  the  ancient  sects.  The modern sects have been got up with the desire of getting back to primitive Christianity; the ancient sects arose directly from the lust of  power — from  fleshly,  selfish,  and  worldly  motives.  Now, however,  since  we  have  so  largely  eaten  of  the  gall  and wormwood,  of  the  bitter  fruits  of  sects  and  parties;  and  have learned the cause, the cure, and the preventive of sectarianism, alas for all that are found keeping up the old landmarks of strife, or laying the foundation for new rivalries, partialities, and antipathies, to  arise  and  pollute  many,  to  retard  the  progress  of  the  gospel abroad, and to foster the spirit of infidelity at home. 

There remains another occurrence of *hairesis* (sect) in the writings of  Peter,  not  yet  formally  examined.  We  shall  now  specially consider  it.  This  Apostle  says,  "There  shall  be  false  teachers among you, who will privately introduce *destructive sects,* denying even  the  Lord  that  bought  them,  bringing  on  themselves  swift destruction; and many will follow their bad practices." Paul, in his valedictory  to  the  Ephesians,  also  speaks  of  "grievous  wolves devouring the flock, and of men rising out of their own society to draw away disciples after them, speaking perverse things." From these intimation we learn that the Apostles Paul and Peter foresaw the rise of sectaries and sects; and both of them, it is worthy of remark, distinctly connected the sects with sectarian teachers: for all sects have been originated by false teachers or by corrupt men. Sectaries, it would appear, occupy the same place under Christ that false Prophets filled under Moses. Need we, then, infer the danger of keeping up religious sects, or go on to prove that every one who builds up a party is a partaker of the crime with him who set it up? 

It behooves all men, then, who wish to be approved by the Lord at his coming, to be up and doing to purge and cleanse the Christian profession  from  every  root  and  branch  of  sectarianism,  and  to endeavor to destroy those destructive sects that have been a sort of Pandora's box to the human race; that have filled the profession with hypocrites, the world with infidels, and retarded for so many centuries the conversion of both Jews and Gentiles to the Christian faith. 

Finally,  while  endeavoring  to  abolish  the  old  sects,  let  us  be cautious that we form not a new one. This may be done by either adding to, or subtracting from, the apostolic constitution a single item.  Our  platform  must  be  as  long  and  as  broad  as  the  New Testament.  Every  person  that  the  Apostles  would  receive,  if present, we must receive; and therefore the one faith, one Lord, one baptism, one hope, one body, one Spirit, one God and Father of all, must be made the reason of one, and only one table. 

Factionists,  or  opinionists,  or  those  who  seek  to  attach  men  to themselves,  because  of  their  opinions  or  talents,  or  personal accidents, whatever they may be, are to be regarded as the very roots of bitterness in the Christian church — as seeking their own interests, honors, and profits, and not the things of Jesus Christ. By such spirits as these the ancient schisms and sects began; and by kindred spirits, of which every generation can furnish its proper ratios, they are kept alive. All such persons have not the power of effecting much; but now and then arises and succeeds in drawing away disciples after him. We can suggest no better remedies or preventives than those commanded by the Apostles. Let us hold fast their traditions; contend only for the faith; allow differences of opinion; suffer no dogmatists; countenance none of the disciples of Diotrephes; and walk by love, guided by that wisdom which is "first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be persuaded, full of mercy  and  of  good  fruits,  without  partiality  and  without hypocrisy." 

From the preceding inductions, it will appear, we presume, very evident to all, that we need neither telescopes nor microscopes to detect *heresies* in the New Testament sense of that word. They are neither more nor less than sects — plain, palpable sects and parties. Every party in Christendom, without respect to any of its tenets, opinions, or practices, is a *heresy,* a schism — unless there be such a party as stands exactly upon the Apostles' ground. Then, in that case, it is a sect just in the sense of the old sect of the Nazarenes, afterwards called *Christians,* and all others are guilty before the Lord, and must be condemned for their opposition to Christ's own party; whose party we are, provided we hold fast all, and only all apostolic traditions, and build upon the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible. 

Part II: Foundation of Christian Union 

Introduction 

'I  pray —  —  — for  those  who  shall  believe  on  me  through  their teaching, *that all may be one;* that as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, *they also may be in us, that the world may believe* that thou hast sent me, and that thou gavest me the glory, which I have given them, that *they may be one,* as we are one; I in them, and thou in me, *that their union may be perfected:* and that *the world may know* that thou hast sent me, and that thou lovest them as thou lovest me.' Thus Messiah prayed; and well might he pray thus, seeing he was wise enough to teach that, 'If a kingdom be torn by factions, that kingdom cannot subsist. And if a family be torn by factions,  that  family  cannot  subsist.  By  civil  dissensions,  any kingdom  can  be  desolated;  and  no  city  or  family,  where  such dissensions are, can subsist.' 

If this be true — and true it is; if Jesus be the Messiah — in what moral desolation is the kingdom of Jesus Christ! — Was there at any time, or is there now, in all the earth, a kingdom more convulsed by internal broils and dissensions, than what is commonly called the church of Jesus Christ! Should any one think it lawful to paganize both the Greek and Latin churches — to eject one hundred millions of  members  of  the  Greek  and  Roman  communions,  from  the visible and invisible precincts of the Christian family or kingdom of Jesus Christ; and regard the Protestant faith and people as the only  true  faith  and  the  only  true  citizens  of  the  kingdom  of Jesus; — what then shall we say of them, contemplated as the visible kingdom, over which Jesus presides as Prophet, Priest, and King! Of  forty  millions  of  Protestants,  shall  we  constitute  the  visible kingdom of the Prince of Peace? Be it so, for the sake of argument; and what then? The Christian army is forty millions strong. But how do they muster? Under forty ensigns? — Under forty antagonist leaders?  Would  to  God  there  were  but  forty!  In  the  Geneva detachment alone, there is almost the numbers of petty chiefs. My soul sickens at the details! 

Take the English branch of the Protestant faith, — I mean England and the United States and all the islands where the English Bible is read; and how many broils, dissensions, and anathemas, may we compute?  I  will  not  attempt  to  name  the  antagonizing  creeds, feuds, and parties, that are in eternal war, under the banners of the Prince of Peace. And yet they talk of love and charity, and of the conversion of the Jews, the Turks, and Pagans!!! 

Shall we turn from the picture, lay down our pen, and languish in despair? No! For Jesus has said, 'Happy *the peace-makers,* for they shall be called *Sons of God.*' But who can make peace, when all the elements are at war? Who so enthusiastic, as to fancy that he can stem the torrent of strife, or quench the violence of sectarian fire! But the page of universal history whispers in our ears, If you tarry till all the belligerent armies lay down their arms, and make one spontaneous and simultaneous effort to unite; you will be as very a simpleton, as he that sat by the Euphrates, waiting till all its waters run into the sea. 

We are so sanguine — perhaps many will say, so visionary, as to imagine that a *nucleus* has been formed, or may be formed; around which may one day congregate all the children of God. No one, at all events, can say that it is either impious or immoral, — that it is inhuman or unchristian, to think about the present state of Christ's kingdom; or to meditate upon the possibility or practicability of any scheme of gathering together the children of God, under the ensign of the Cross alone. No one can say that such an enterprise is absolutely  chimerical,  unless  he  affirms  the  negative  of  the Messiah's  proposition,  and  declares  that  the  present  wars  and strifes must extend and multiply through all time, and that God will convert the whole world, *without answering the prayer of his Son;* or rather, on a plan adverse to that promulgated by him, and in despite of all the moral desolations which have ensued upon all the broils and battles of five hundred sects, and fifteen hundred years! 

Dare any one say, or even think in unphilanthropic or malevolent, to make an effort to rally the broken phalanxes of Zion's King, and to attempt to induce them to turn their arms from one another, against  the  common  foe? With  such  a  one,  it were  worse  than hopeless to reason, or to exchange a single argument. Shall we not rather  esteem  it  to  be  the  most  honorable,  acceptable,  and praiseworthy enterprise, that can be dared or undertaken by mortal man on this earthly stage of action? And as God has ever effected the most splendid revolutions by the most humble agents, and by means the most unlikely in the wisdom of all human schools; we think it not amiss or incongruous to make an effort, and to put out hands to the work of peace and love. 

From Messiah's  intercession  above quoted, it is incontrovertible that union is strength, and disunion, weakness; that there is a plan founded in infinite wisdom and love, by which, and which alone, the world may both *believe* and *know,* that God has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. And like all the schemes of Heaven, it is simple to admiration. No mortal need fancy that he shall have the honor of devising either the plan of uniting Christians in one holy  band  of  zealous  co-operation,  or  of  converting  Jews  and Gentiles to the faith that Jesus is that *seed,* in whom all the families of the earth are yet to be blessed. The plan is divine. It is ordained by God; and, better still, it is already revealed. Is any one impatient to  hear  it?  Let  him  again  read  the  intercessions  of  the  Lord Messiah,  which  we  have  chosen  for  our  motto.  Let  him  then examine the two following propositions, and say whether these do not express Heaven's own scheme of augmenting and conversating the body of Christ. 

***First.** Nothing is essential to the conversion of the world, but the union and co-operation of Christians.* 

***Second.** Nothing is essential to the union of Christians, but the Apostles' teaching or testimony.* 

Or does he choose to express the plan of the Self-Existent in other words? Then he may change the order, and say, 

***First.** The testimony of the Apostles, is the only and all-sufficient means of uniting all Christians.* 

***Second.** The union of Christians with the Apostles' testimony, is all-sufficient, and alone sufficient, to the conversion of the world.* Neither truth alone, nor union alone, is sufficient to subdue the unbelieving nations; but truth and union combined, are omnipotent. They are *omnipotent,* for God is in them and with them, and has consecrated and blessed them for this very purpose. 

These  two  propositions  have  been  stated,  illustrated, developed, — and shall I say proved, in the *Christian Baptist,* and *Millennial Harbinger,* to the conviction of thousands. Indeed, one of them is as universally conceded, as it has been proposed, viz: *That the union of Christians is essential* *to the conversion of the world;*  and  though,  perhaps,  some  might  be  found  who  would question, whether, if all Christians were united, the whole world could be converted to God; there is no person, of whom we have heard,  who  admits  a  general  or  universal  prevalence  of  the gospel — in  what  is  usually  called  the  millennial  age  of  the world — and who admits that moral means will have anything to do with its introduction, who does not also admit that the union of Christians is essential to that state of things. Indeed, to suppose that all Christians will form one communion in that happy age of the world, and not before it, is to suppose a moral effect without a cause. 

The second proposition, viz. — *That the word or testimony of the Apostles is itself all-sufficient, and alone sufficient, to the union of all  Christians,*  cannot  be  rationally  doubted  by  any  person acquainted with that testimony, or who admits the competency of their inspiration to make them infallible teachers of the Christian institution.  And,  indeed,  all  who  contend  for  those  human institutions called creeds, contend for them as necessary only to the existence of a party, or while the present schisms, contentions, and dissensions exist. Therefore, all the defences of creeds, ancient and modern, while they assert that the Bible alone is the only perfect and infallible rule of faith and morals; not only concede that these symbols called creeds, are imperfect and fallible, — but, also, that these creeds never can achieve what the Bible, without them, can accomplish. 

But  how  to  do  without  them,  appears  to  be  an  insuperable difficulty to many well disposed Christians. To labor this point 

would  be  foreign  to  our  present  purpose;  especially  as  it  has already been fully discussed in the present controversy.1 

It  is,  perhaps,  altogether  sufficient  at  present  to  propose  the question, How has, what is called the church, done with them? Have  they  not  been  the  fruitful  cause  or  occasion  of  all  the discords, schisms, and parties, now existing in Christendom? And will  not  a  very  superficial  observation,  and  a  little  experience, convince every man that the rivers tend not more certainly to the sea, than creeds and human devices in religion, tend to discords and divisions. Take, for example, two of the most popular creeds of  the  present  day — the  Westminster,  and  that  of  the Methodist — with  whose  history  American  society  is  better acquainted  than  with  that  of  any  other,  and  test  the  tree  of  its fruits, — judge their tendency by their practical effects upon society. To say nothing of the lesser schisms in the party, that once formed one communion on the platform of the Westminster creed, we can now  enumerate  no  less  than  nine  separate  communions — all professing the Westminster articles, in substance or in form. These are the General Assembly in Scotland and the United States, the Cameronians or Solemn League and Covenant Presbyterians, the Burghers or Unionists, the Anti-Burghers or Seceders, the Relief Presbyterians, the Cumberland Presbyterians, and the New School, now upon the eve of being born. To these might be added those called English Presbyterians, who are now more generally known by the name of Independents and Congregationalists; and, indeed, the  Glassites  or  Sandemanians,  who  came  out  of  the  synod  of Angus and Mearns in  the  year 1728. Thus in  one hundred and ninety years, have nine or ten distinct communions originated out of the Westminster creed. Some of them, too, as discordant and 

aloof from each other, as were the Jews and Samaritans. 

Nor have the Methodists in England, Canada, and the United States done much better for their age. They now form five or six separate communions,  under  different  names.  To  say  nothing  of  the Whitefieldite Methodists, those of John Wesley, are, the Wesleyan Methodists,  the  New  Connection  of  Methodists,  the  Methodist Episcopal church, the O'Kelly Methodists, the Radicals, etc. 

And  what  shall  I  say  of  the  twelve  or  fourteen  sects  of Baptists — many of whom have as much affection for the Greek and Roman church, as for one another! It were useless to furnish other evidence in proof that human opinions, inferential reasonings, and deductions from the Bible, exhibited in the form of creeds, can never unite Christians; as all their fruits are alienation, repulsion, bickering, and schism. *No human creed in Protestant Christendom can be found, that has not made a division for every generation of its existence.* And I may add — the more thinking, inquisitive, and intelligent the community which owns a creed, the more frequent their debates and schisms. 

But the Bible will do not better, if men approach it with a set of opinions, or a human symbol in their minds. For then it is not the Bible, but the opinions in the mind, that form the bond of union. Men, indeed, had better have a *written* than an *unwritten* standard of orthodoxy, if they will  not  abandon speculation  and abstract notions, as any part of Christian faith or duty. 

But all these modes of faith and worship are based upon a mistake of the true character of Revelation, which it has long been our effort  to  correct.  With  us,  Revelation  has  nothing  to  do  with opinions,  or  abstract  reasonings;  for  it  is  founded  wholly  and entirely  upon  *facts.*  There  is  not  one  abstract  opinion,  not  one speculative view, asserted or communicated in Old Testament or New.  Moses  begins  with  asserting  facts  that  had  transpired  in creation and providence; and John ends with asserting prophetic or prospective  facts,  in  the  future  displays  of  providence  and redemption.  Facts,  then,  are  the  *alpha*  and  the  *omega*  of  both Jewish and Christian revelations. 

But  that the reader may have before his  mind in one summary view,  the  whole  scheme  of  union  and  co-operation,  which  the Living Oracles and the present state of the Christian religion in the world demand; which has been, at different times and in various manners,  illustrated  and  sustained  in  the  present  controversy, against divisions, — we shall here submit it in one period. 

*Let*  **the  bible**  *be  substituted  for  all  human  creeds;*  **facts**,  *for definitions,*  **things**,  *for  words;*  **faith**,  *for  speculation;*  **unity  of faith**, *for unity of opinion;* **the positive commandments of god**, *for  human  legislation  and  tradition;*  **piety**,  *for  ceremony;* **morality**, *for partisan zeal;* **the practice of religion**, *for the mere profession of it; — and the work is done.* 

For the illustration of the leading terms, and their correlates found in this *project,* and for a full development of our meaning, (as we may  nor  may  not  be  understood,  if  interpreted  by  the  polemic vocabulary of this age,) — we shall introduce some extracts from the *Christian  Baptist*  and  *Millennial  Harbinger,*  developing  our meaning, and containing some of the capital positions which have been fully elicited and canvassed, in a controversy of twelve years. 

1. Fact 

*Fact* means something done. The term *deed,* so common in the reign of James the First, is equivalent to our term *fact.* Truth and fact, though often confounded, are not the same. All facts are truth, but all truths are not facts. That God exists, is a truth, but not a fact; that he created the heavens and the earth, is a fact and a truth. That Paul was the Apostle of the Gentiles, is a truth, but not a fact; and that he preached Christ to the Gentiles is both a fact and a truth. The simple agreement of the terms of any proposition with the subject of that proposition, or the representation of anything as it exists, is a truth. But something must be done, acted, or effected, before  we  have  a  fact.  There  are  manythings  true  in  religion, morals, politics, and general science, which are not facts; but these are all but the correspondence of words and ideas with the things of which they treat. 

Facts have a power which logical truth has not; and therefore, we say, that facts are stubborn things. They are *things,* not *words.* The power of any fact, is the meaning; and therefore the measure of its power is the magnitude of its import. All moral facts have a moral meaning; and those are properly called moral facts, which either exhibit, develop, or form moral character. All those facts, or works of  God,  which  are  purely  physical,  exhibit  what  have  been commonly called his natural or physical perfections; and all those facts or works of God, which are purely moral, exhibit his moral character.  It  so  happens,  however,  that  all  his  works,  when properly understood, exhibit both his physical and moral character, when  viewed  in  all  their  proper  relations.  Thus  the  deluge exhibited  his  power,  his  justice,  and  his  truth;  and  therefore, displayed both his physical and moral grandeur. The turning of water into wine, apart from its design, is purely a demonstration of physical power; but when its design is apprehended, it has a moral force equal to its physical majesty. 

The work of redemption is a system of work, or deeds, on the part of Heaven, which  constitutes the most splendid series of moral facts which man or angel ever saw. And they are the proof, the argument, or the demonstration, of that regenerating proposition which presents God and *love* as two names for one idea. 

When  these  facts  are  understood,  or  brought  into  immediate contact with the mind of man, as a moral seal or archetype, they delineate the image of God upon the human soul. *All the means of grace are, therefore, only the means of impressing this seal upon the  heart;  of  bringing  these*  *moral  facts  to  make  their  full impression on the soul of man.* Testimony and faith are but the channel through which these facts, or the hand of God, draws the image on the heart and character of man. If then the fact and the testimony are both the gift of God, we may well say that faith and eternal life are also the gift of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

To  enumerate  the  gospel  facts  would  be  to  narrate  all  that  is recorded of the sayings and doings of Jesus Christ, from his birth to his coronation in the heavens. They are, however, concentrated in a few prominent ones, which group together all the love of God in the gift of his Son. He died for our sins, He was buried in the grave, He rose from the dead for our justification, and is ascended to the skies to prepare mansions for his disciples, comprehend the whole, or are the heads to the chapters which narrate the love of God, and display his moral majesty and glory to our view. 

These moral facts unfold all the moral grandeur of Jehovah, and make Jesus the effulgence of his glory, the express image of his substance. These are the moral seal which *testimony* conveys to the understanding, and *faith* brings to the hearts of sinners, by which God creates them anew, and forms them for his glory. It is the Spirit which bears witness — the Spirit of God and of Christ which gives the testimony, and confirms it in the disciples. But let us next proceed to *testimony.* 

2. Testimony 

The  Romans,  from  whom  we  have  borrowed  much  of  our language, called the witness the *testis.* The declaration of this *testis* is still called testimony. In reference to the material system around us, to all objects and matters of sense, the eye, the ear, the smell, the  taste,  the  feeling,  are  the  five  witnesses.  What  we  call  the evidence of sense, is, therefore, the testimony of these witnesses, which  constitute  the  five  avenues  to  the  human  mind  from  the kingdom  of  nature.  They  are  figuratively  called  witnesses,  and their  evidence,  testimony.  But  the  report  or  declaration  of intelligent beings, such as God, angels, and men, constitute what is properly and literally called *testimony.* 

As light reflected from any material object upon the eye, brings that object into contact with the eye, or enables the object to make its image on the eye, so testimony concerning any fact, brings that fact into contact with the mind, and enables it to impress itself, or to form its image upon the intellect, or mind of man. Now, be it observed,  that  as  by  our  five  external  senses  we  acquire  all information of the objects of sense around us, so by testimony, human  or  divine,  we  receive  all  our  information  upon  all  facts which are not the objects of immediate exercise of our five senses upon the things around us. 

To  appreciate  the  full  value  of  testimony  in  divine  work  of regeneration, we have only to reflect, that all the moral facts which can form moral character, after the divine model, or which  can effect  a  moral  or  religious  change  in  man,  are  found  in  the testimony of God: and that no fact can operate at all, where it is not present; or where it is not known. The love of God in the death of the Messiah, never drew a tear of gratitude or joy from any eye, or excited a grateful emotion in any heart among the nations of our race to whom the testimony never came. No fact in the history of six thousand years, no work of God in creation, providence, or redemption, has ever influenced the heart of man or woman, to whom it has not been testified. Testimony is, then, in regeneration, as necessary as the facts of which it speaks. 

The real value of anything, is the labor which it cost, and its utility when acquired. If reason and justice arbitrated all questions upon the value of property, the decision would be, that every article is worth the amount of human labor which is necessary to obtain it; and when obtained, it is again to be tried in the scales of utility. Now, as all the facts, and all the truth which can renovate human nature, are in the testimony of God; and as that testimony cost the labor  and  the  lives  of  the  wisest  and  best  that  ever  lived,  that testimony, to us, is just as valuable as the facts which it records, and the labors and the lives which it cost, and just as indispensable in the process of regeneration, as were the labors and the lives of Prophets, Apostles, and the Son of God. 

History, or narrative, whether oral or written, is only another name for testimony. When, then, we reflect how large a portion of both Testaments is occupied in history, we may judge of how much importance it is in the judgment of God. Prophecy, also, being the history of future facts, or a record of things to be done, belongs to the same chapter of facts and record. Now if all past facts, and all future facts, or all the history or testimony concerning them, was erased from the volumes of God's inspiration, how small would the remainder be! These considerations, added together, only in part exhibit the value and utility of testimony in the regeneration of mankind. But its value will be still more evident, when the proper import of the term *faith* is fully set before us. 

3. Faith 

*No testimony, no faith:* for faith is only the belief of testimony, or confidence in testimony as true. To believe without testimony, is just as impossible as to see without light. The measure, quality, and power of faith, are always found in the testimony believed. 

Where testimony begins, faith begins; and where testimony ends, faith ends. We believe Moses just as far as Moses speaks or writes: and when Moses has  recorded his  last  fact,  or  testified his  last truth, our faith in Moses terminates. His five books are, therefore, the length and breadth, the height and depth, or, in other words, the *measure,* of our faith in Moses. The *quality* or value of faith is found in the quality of value of the testimony. If the testimony be valid and authoritative, our faith is strong and operative. 'If,' says John, 'we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater,' stronger, and more worthy of credit. The value of a bank bill, is the amount of the precious metals which it represents, and the indisputable evidence of its genuineness; so the value of faith is the importance of the facts which the testimony presents, and the assurance afforded that the testimony is true. True, or unfeigned faith, may be contrasted with feigned faith; but true faith is the belief of truth: for he that believes a lie, believes in vain. 

The *power* of faith is also  the power, or moral meaning of the testimony, or of the facts which the testimony represents.  If by faith I am transported with joy, or overwhelmed in sorrow, that joy or sorrow is in the facts contained in the testimony, or in the nature and relation of those facts to me. If faith purifies the heart, works by  love,  and  overcomes  the  world,  this  power  is  in  the  facts believed. If a father has more joy in believing that a lost son has been found, than in believing that a lost sheep has been brought home to his fold, the reason of this greater joy is not in the nature of his believing, but in the nature of the facts believed. 

Here I am led to expatiate on a very popular and pernicious error of modern times. The error is, that the nature, or power and saving efficacy of faith, is not in the truth believed, but in the *nature* of our faith, or in *the manner of believing* the truth. Hence all that unmeaning jargon about the nature of faith, and all those disdainful sneers at what is called "historic faith," — as if there could be any faith  without  history,  written  or  spoken.  Who  ever  believed  in Jesus Christ, without hearing the history of him? '*How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?*' Faith never can be more  than  the  receiving  of  testimony  as  true,  or  the  belief  of testimony;  and  if  that  testimony  be  written,  it  is  called history — though  it  is  as  much  history  when  flowing  from  the tongue, as when flowing from the pen. 

Let it be again repeated, and remembered, that there is no other manner of believing a fact, than by receiving it as true. If it is not received as true, it is not believed; and when it is believed, it is no more than regarded as true. This being conceded, then it follows, that the efficacy of faith is always in the fact believed, or the object received, and not in the nature or manner of believing. 

"Faith was bewildered much by men who meant  To make it clear, so simple in itself.  

A thought so rudimental and so plain,  

That none by comment could it plainer make.  

All faith was one. In object, not in kind,  

The difference lay. The faith that saved a soul,  And that which in the common truth believed,  

In essence, were the same. Hear, then, what faith,  True Christian faith, which brought salvation, was:  Belief in all that God revealed to men;  

Observe, in all that God revealed to men,  

In all he promised, threatened, commanded, said,  Without exception, and without a doubt."2  

` `This holds universally in all the sensitive, intellectual, and moral powers  of  man.  All  our  pleasures  and  pains,  all  our  joys  and sorrows, are the effects of the objects of sensation, reflection, faith, etc. apprehended or received, and not in the nature of the exercise of any power of capacity with which we are endowed. We shall illustrate and confirm this assertion by an appeal to the experience of all.  

Let us glance at all our sensitive powers. If, on surveying with the eye a beautiful landscape, I am pleased, and on surveying a battle field  strewed  with  the  spoils  of  death,  I  am  pained, — is  it  in accordance with truth to say, that the pleasure or the pain received was occasioned by the nature of vision, or the mode of seeing? Was it not *the sight,* the thing seen, the object of vision, which produced the pleasure and the pain? The action of looking, or the mode of seeing, was in both cases the same; but the things seen, or the  objects  of  vision,  were  different; — consequently,  the  effects produced were different. 

If  on  hearing  the  melody  of  the  grove  I  am  delighted,  and  on hearing the peals of thunder breaking to pieces the cloud, dark with horror, hanging over my head, I am terrified, — is the delight or the terror to be ascribed to the manner or nature of hearing, or to the thing heard? Is it not the thing heard, which produces the delight or the terror? 

If I am refreshed by the balmy fragrance of the opening bloom of spring, or sickened by the fetid effluvia of putrid carcasses, — are these  effects  to  be  ascribed  to  the  peculiar  nature  or  mode  of smelling, or to the thing smelt? Or when the honey and the gall come in contact with my taste, — is the sweet or the bitter to be regarded as the effect of my manner of tasting, or to the object tasted? And when I touch the ice, or the blazing torch, — is the effect or feeling produced to be imputed to the manner of feeling them, or to the thing felt? May we not, then, affirm that all the pleasures and pains of sense; all the effects of sensation; are the results, not of the manner in which our five senses are exercised, but of the objects on which they are exercised? it may be said, without in the least  invalidating  this  conclusion,  that  the  more  intimate  the exercise  of  our  senses  is  with  the  things  on  which  they  are exercised, the stronger and more forcible will be the impressions made: but still it is the object seen, heard, smelt, tasted, or felt, which affects us. 

Passing from the outward to the inward man, and on examining the powers of intellection one by one, we shall find no exception to the law  which  pervades  all  our  sensitive  powers.  It  is  neither  the faculty of perception, nor the manner of perception, but the thing perceived,  that  excites  us  to  action:  it  is  not  the  exercise  of reflection, but the thing reflected upon: it is not memory, nor the exercise  of  recollection,  but  the  thing  remembered:  it  is  not imagination, but the thing imagined: it is not reason itself, nor the exercise  of  reason,  but  the  thing  reasoned  upon,  which  affords pleasure or pain — which excites to action — which cheers, allures, consoles — which grieves, disquiets, or discommodes us. 

Ascending to our volitions and our affections, we shall find the same universality. In a word, it is not choosing, nor refusing; it is not loving, hating, fearing, desiring, nor hoping; it is not the nature of any power, faculty, or capacity of our nature, nor the simple exercise of them, but the objects or things upon which they are exercised,  which  give  us  pleasure  or  pain;  which  induce  us  to action,  or  influence  our  behavior.  Faith,  then,  or  the  power  of believing, must be an anomalous thing; a power *sui generis;* an exception  to  the  laws  under  which  every  power,  faculty,  or capacity of man is placed, unless its measure, quality, power, and efficacy be in the facts which are testified, in the objects on which it terminates. 

There is no connection of cause and effect more intimate; there is no  system  of  dependencies  more  closely  linked;  there  is  no arrangement of things more natural or necessary, than the ideas represented by the terms  *fact, testimony, faith,* and *feeling.* The first is for the last, and the two intermediates are made necessary by the force of circumstances, as the means for the end. The fact, or the thing said to be done, produces the change in the frame of mind. The testimony, or the report of the thing said or done, is essential to belief; and belief of it is necessary to bring the thing said or done to the heart. The change of heart is the end proposed in this part of the process of regeneration; and we may see that the process on the part of Heaven is, thus far, natural and rational; or, in other words, consistent with the constitution of our nature.3 

4. Confirmation of the Testimony 

   All revealed religion is based upon facts. Testimony has respect to facts  only;  and  that  testimony  may  be  credible,  it  must  be confirmed. These points are of so much importance as to deserve some  illustration,  and  much  consideration.  By  *facts*  we  always mean something said or done. The works of God and the words of God, or the things done and spoken by God, are those facts which are laid down and exhibited in the Bible as the foundation of all faith,  hope,  love,  piety,  and  humanity.  All  true  and  useful knowledge is an acquaintance with facts. And all true science is acquired from the observation and comparison of facts. But he that made the heart of man and gave him an intelligent spirit. knows that facts alone can move the affections and command the passions of man. Hence the scheme of mercy which he has discovered to the world, is all contained in, and developed by, *the works of mercy* which he has wrought. 

Facts have a meaning which the understanding apprehends, and the heart feels. According to the meaning or nature of the fact, is its effect upon us. If a friend have risked his life, or sacrificed his reputation or fortune to relieve us, we cannot but confide in him and love him. If an enemy have attempted our life, invaded our property, or attacked our reputation, we cannot, naturally, but hate him. Nothing but the command of a benefactor, or the will of some dear  friend,  who  had  laid  us  under  obligation  to  himself,  can prevent  us from hating  our enemies.  If a beloved relative have sustained some great misfortune, we must feel sorry; or if he have been rescued from some impending calamity, we must feel glad. Our joy in the latter case, and our sorrow in the former, arise from the meaning or nature of the fact. The feelings corresponding with the  nature  of  the  fact,  are  excited  or  called  into  existence  the moment the fact is known or believed. It is *known* when we have witnessed it ourselves, and it is *believed* when reported to us by credible persons who have witnessed it. This is the chief difference between faith and knowledge. 

As  existence  or  beings  must  precede  knowledge,  so  facts  must precede either knowledge or belief. An event must happen before it can be known by man — it must be known by some before it can be reported to others — it must be reported before it can be believed, and the testimony must be confirmed, or made credible, before it can be relied on. 

Something  must  be  done  before  it  can  be  known,  reported,  or believed. Hence, in the order of nature, there is first the fact, then the  testimony,  and  then  the  belief.  A  was  drowned  before  B reported it — B reported it before C believed it, and C believed it before he was grieved at it. This is the unchangeable and universal order of things as respects belief. In this example when we reason from effect to cause, it is *grief, belief, testimony, fact* — and from cause to effect, it is *fact, testimony, belief, grief.* We ascend from grief to belief — from belief to testimony — from testimony to fact. We descend from fact to testimony — from testimony to belief — and from  belief  to  grief.  To  this  there  is  no  exception,  more  than against the universality of the law of gravity. If, then, there was nothing said or done, there could be no testimony, and so no faith. Religious  affections  spring  from  faith;  and,  therefore,  it  is  of importance,  that  this  subject  should  be  disintricated  from  the mysticism of the schools. 

Laws call for obedience, and testimony for belief. Where there is no law, there can be no obedience; and when there is no testimony, there can be no faith. As obedience cannot transcend law, so faith cannot  transcend  testimony.  John's  testimony  went  to  so  many facts.  On  his  testimony  we  can  believe  only  as  far  as  he  has testified. And so of all the other witnesses. The certainty of faith depends upon the certainty or credibility of the witnesses. But not so  its  effects.  The  *effects*  depend  upon  the  facts  believed — the *certainty* upon the evidence. I may be equally certain that John was beheaded — that Jesus was crucified. Nay, I may be as certain of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, as I am of his death on Calvary. The testimony may be equally credible, and the faith equally strong; but the effects produced are not the same. The facts believed have not  the  same  meaning,  are  not  of  the  same  nature,  and  do  not produce the same feelings or effects. I may be as certain of the assassination  of  Cesar  in  the  Senate  House,  as  I  am  of  the crucifixion of Jesus on Calvary: but as the facts believed are as diverse in their nature, meaning, and bearings upon me, as the East and the West; so the effects or fruits of my faith are as different as Julius Cesar and Jesus Christ. 

The  more  ordinary  the  fact,  the  more  ordinary  the  testimony necessary to establish it. That A B, aged 90, and confined for some time with sickness, died last night, requires only the most ordinary testimony to render it credible. But that C D lived to 140, enjoying unabated vigor of mind and body, requires stronger testimony. But still,  all  facts  happening  in  accordance  with  the  ordinary  and natural laws of things, require but good human testimony to make them worthy of credence. It is only extraordinary and supernatural facts  which  require  supernatural  testimony,  or  testimony supernaturally confirmed. This is the point to which we have been looking in this essay. And now that we have arrived at it, I would ask, *How has the testimony of the Apostles and Evangelists been confirmed?* 

To *confirm a testimony* is neither more nor less than to make it credible to those to whom it is tendered; or, to express the same idea in other words, it is to give men power to believe. Now, it will not  require  the  same  amount  of  evidence  to  persuade  an astronomer that the earth's shadow struck the moon last eclipse, as it  would  to  convince  an  Indian;  nor  would  it  require  the  same amount of evidence to convince a chemist that combustion was effected  by  pouring  water  on  a  certain  composition  of  mineral substances,  as  it  would  an  unlettered  swain.  To  make  any testimony credible to any order of beings, regard must therefore be had to the capacity, attainments, and habits of those beings. To confirm the testimony of the Apostles concerning the Messiah's death, resurrection, ascension into heaven, and coronation as the Lord and King of the Universe, imports no more nor no less than that it should be rendered every way credible to such things as we are,  or  that  we  should  be  made  able  to  believe.  A  testimony *confirmed,* and yet *incredible* to those to whom it is tendered, is a contradiction in terms. But why emphasize on the word *confirmed?* Because the holy Apostles have emphasized upon it. It is therefore necessary that we should pay a due regard to the confirmation of the testimony. The testimony is one thing, and the confirmation is another.  It  is  necessary,  in  all  important  occasions  in  human affairs, that the testimony which is received between man and man should  be  confirmed  by  some  sanction.  Hence  an  oath  for confirmation  of  testimony  is  an  end  of  all  strife.  The  highest confirmation  which  men  require  in  all  questions  of  facts,  is  a solemn oath or affirmation that the things affirmed are true. 

But supernatural facts require supernatural confirmations. Hence when the confirmation of the gospel is spoken of in the apostolic writings, it is resolved into the doings or works of the Holy Spirit. '*Demonstrations of the Holy Spirit,* are the confirmatory proofs of the  gospel.  When  Paul  delivered  the  testimony  of  God,  or  the testimony concerning Jesus, to the Corinthians, he says, '*It is was confirmed among them.*' And if we examine into the confirmation of the testimony as Paul explained it, we shall find that he makes the spiritual gifts, or those extraordinary and miraculous powers which the Apostles themselves displayed, and which so many of their converts also possessed, an assurance or confirmation of what he promulged. 

We shall only attend to the light which one of his epistles to the Corinthians throws upon this subject. After thanking his God for the favor bestowed upon the disciples  of Corinth  when he first visited them, he proceeds to specify the special favors bestowed upon the disciples in that renowned city. 'You were enriched (says he, chap. 1: ver. 5.) with every gift by him, even with *all speech* and *all knowledge* when the testimony of Christ was confirmed among  you:  so  that  you  come  behind  in  *no  gift.*'  'There  are diversities of gifts, (says he, chap. 12:) for to one disciple is given *the word of wisdom;* to another, *the word of knowledge;* to another, *faith,* (to be healed;) to another, *the gift of healing;* to another, *the ability  of  working  in  others  the  power  of  working  miracles;*  to another,  *prophecy;*  to  another,  *discerning  of  spirits;*  to  another, *divers kinds of foreign tongues;* and to another, *the interpretation of foreign tongues.*' — Now, the Corinthians were put in possession of these (for they came behind in no gift) 'when the testimony of Christ was confirmed among them.' For, says Paul, I came not to you with the excellency of speech, or the persuasive eloquence of the schools, but with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power; that your belief of my testimony, or your faith, might not rest, or be founded upon human wisdom or eloquence, but upon the power of God evinced in the demonstrations of the Spirit which confirmed my  testimony  among  you.  For  had  it  not  been  for  these demonstrations of the Spirit and power, your faith could not have rested upon an immoveable basis. 

To those desirous to understand this subject, an examination of this first letter to the Corinthians cannot fail to be most instructive; for it  most  clearly  and  unequivocally  teaches  us  that  the  *visible, audible, sensible* demonstration of the Spirit and of power, was that supernatural attestation of the testimony of Christ which made it  credible,  so  that  no  man  could  have  acknowledged  Jesus  of Nazareth to be the Almighty Lord, but by this demonstration of the Holy Spirit.  Thus was  the testimony  confirmed — thus  was Jesus demonstrated to be the only begotten Son of God —  and thus, and thus only, are men enabled to believe in him.4 

5. Fundamental Fact

Amidst  the  uncertainty,  darkness,  and  vice,  that  overspread  the earth, the Messiah appears, and lays a foundation of hope, of true religion, and of religious union, unknown, unheard of, unexpected among  men.  The  Jews  were  united  by  consanguinity,  and  by agreement in a ponderous ritual. The Gentiles rallied under every opinion, and were grouped, like filings of steel around a magnet, under every possible shade of difference of thought, concerning their mythology. So long as unity of opinion was regarded as a proper  basis  of  religious  union,  so  long  have  mankind  been distracted by the multiplicity and variety of opinions. To establish what is called a system of orthodox opinions as the bond of union, was, in fact, offering a premium for new diversities in opinion, and for increasing,  *ad infinitum,*  opinions,  sects,  and divisions. And what is worse than all, it was establishing self-love and pride as religious  principles,  as  fundamental  to  salvation;  or  a  love regulated  by  similarity  of  opinion,  is  only  a  love  to  one's  own opinion; and all the zeal exhibited in the defence of it, is but the workings of the pride of opinion. 

When  the  Messiah  appeared  as  the  founder  of  a  new  religion, systems of religion consisting of opinions and speculations upon matter and mind, upon God and nature, upon virtue and vice, had been adopted, improved, reformed, and exploded time after time. That  there  was  always  something  superfluous,  something defective, something wrong, something that could be improved, in every system of religion and morality, was generally felt, and at last universally acknowledged. But  the  grandeur, sublimity, and beauty of the foundation of hope, and of ecclesiastical or social union,  established  by  the  author  and  founder  of  Christianity, consisted in this, that **the belief of one fact**, *and that upon the best evidence in the world, is all that is requisite, as far as faith goes, to salvation.  The*  *belief  of  this*  **one  fact**  *and  submission  to*  **one institution** *expressive of it, is all that is required of Heaven to admission  into  the  church.*  A  Christian,  as  defined,  not  by  Dr. Johnson, nor any creed-maker, but by one taught from Heaven, is one that believes this *one fact,* and has submitted to *one institution,* and whose deportment accords with the morality and virtue of the great  Prophet.  The  one  fact  is  expressed  in  a  single proposition — *that Jesus the Nazarene is the Messiah.* The evidence upon which it is to be believed is the testimony of *twelve men,* confirmed  by  prophecy,  miracles,  and  spiritual  gifts.  The  *one institution* is baptism into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Every such person is a disciple in the fullest sense of the word, the moment he has believed this one fact, upon the  above  evidence,  and  has  submitted  to  the  above  mentioned institution; and whether he believes the five points condemned, or the five points approved by the synod of Dort, is not so much as to be  asked  of  him;  whether  he  holds  any  of  the  views  of  the Calvinists or Arminians, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists, or Quakers, is never once to be asked of such persons, in order  to  admission  into  the  Christian  community,  called  the church. The only doubt that can reasonably arise upon these points, is, whether this *one fact,* in its nature and necessary results, can suffice to the salvation of the soul, and whether the open avowal of it, in the overt act of baptism, can be a sufficient recommendation of  the  person,  so  professing,  to  the  confidence  and  love  of  the brotherhood. As to the first of these, it is again and again asserted, in the clearest language, by the Lord himself, the Apostles Peter, Paul, and John, that he that believes the testimony that Jesus is the Christ, is begotten by God, may overcome the world, has eternal life,  and  is,  on  the  veracity  of  God,  saved  from  his  sins.  This should settle the first point; for the witnesses agree that whosoever confesses  that  Jesus  is  the  Christ,  and  is  baptized,  should  be received into the church; and not an instance can be produced of any person being asked for any other faith, in order to admission, in  the whole New Testament. The Savior  expressly declared to Peter, that upon this fact, that he was the Messiah, the Son of God, he would *build his church;* and Paul has expressly declared that "other foundation can no man lay (for ecclesiastical union) than that  **Jesus  is  the  Christ**."  The  point  is  proved  that  we  have assumed; and this proved, every thing is established requisite to the union of all Christians upon a proper basis. 

It must strike  every  man of  reflection, that  a religion  requiring much mental abstraction or exquisite refinement of thought, or that calls  for  the  comprehension  or  even  apprehension  of  refined distinctions  and  of  nice  subtleties,  is  a  religion  not  suited  to mankind in their present circumstances. To present such a creed as the Westminster, as adopted, either by Baptists or Paido-Baptists; such  a  creed  as  the  Episcopalian,  or,  in  the  fact,  any  sectarian creed,  composed  as  they  all  are,  of  propositions,  deduced  by logical inferences, and couched in philosophical language, to all those who are fit subjects of the salvation of Heaven — I say, to present such a creed to such for their examination or adoption, shocks  all  common  sense.  This  pernicious  course  is  what  has paganized  Christianity.  Our  sects  and  parties,  our  disputes  and speculations, our orders and castes, so much resemble anything but Christianity,  that  when  we  enter  a  modern  synagogue,  or  an ecclesiastical  council,  we  seem  rather  to  have  entered  a  Jewish sanhedrim, a Mohometan mosque, a Pagan temple, or an Egyptian cloister,  than  a  Christian  congregation.  Sometimes,  indeed,  our religious meetings so resemble the Areopagus, the Forum, or the Senate, that we almost suppose ourselves to have been translated to Athens or Rome. Even Christian orators emulate Demosthenes and Cicero.  Christian  doctrines  are  made  to  assume  the  garb  of Egyptian mysteries, and Christian observances put on the pomp and pageantry of pagan ceremonies. Unity of opinion, expressed in subscription  to  voluminous  dogmas  imported  from  Geneva, Westminster, Edinburgh, or Rome, is made the bond of union: and a  difference  in  the  tenth,  or  ten  thousandth  shade  of  opinion, frequently  becomes  the  actual  cause  of  dismemberment  or expulsion. The New Testament was not designed to occupy the same  place  in  theological  seminaries  that  the  carcases  of malefactors  are  condemned  to  occupy  in  medical  halls — first doomed  to  the  gibbet,  and  then  to  the  dissecting  knife  of  the spiritual anatomist. Christianity  consists infinitely more in  good works than in sound opinions; and while it is a joyful truth, that he that believes and is baptized shall be saved, it is equally true that he that says, 'I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.'6  

6. Purity of Speech 

If  I  were  to  classify  in  *three*  chapters  the  whole  Christian institution, after the fashion of the modern schools, for the sake of being understood, I would designate them Christian *faith,* Christian *worship,* and Christian *morality.* To these the moderns have added two others, which, using the same licence,  I would  call human *philosophy,* and human *traditions.* Now, in the first chapter, we, and all Christians, are agreed: for as Christian faith has respect to *the matters of fact* recorded — to the direct testimony of God found in the New Testament concerning himself — concerning his Son and Spirit — concerning mankind — what he has done, and what he will do, on it there is no debate. I find all *confessions of* **faith**, properly so called, like the *four* gospels, tell the same story so far as matters of fact or faith are concerned. 

In  the  second  chapter  we  are  also  agreed,  that  God  is  to  be worshipped through the Mediator — in prayer, in praise, public and private — in the ordinances of Christian baptism, the Lord's day, the Lord's supper, and in the devotional study of his word and of his works of creation and providence. 

In the third chapter we all acknowledge the same moral code. What is  morality,  is  confessed  and  acknowledged  by  all;  but  in  the practice of it there are great subtractions. 

We repudiate the two remaining chapters as having any place in our  faith,  worship,  or  morality;  because  we  think  we  have discovered that all the divisions in Protestant Christendom — that all the partyism, vain jangling, and heresies which have disgraced the Christian profession, have emanated from human philosophy and human  tradition.  It  is  not  faith,  nor  piety,  nor  morality;  but philosophy  and  tradition  that  have  alienated  and  estranged Christians, and prevented the conversion of the world. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, deserved not the reputation of philosophers, if Calvin, Arminius, and Wesley, were not worthy of it. The former philosophised morally on nature and ancient tradition — the latter, on the Bible, and human society. 

Religious philosophers on the Bible have excogitated the following doctrines and philosophical distinctions: —  

'The Holy Trinity,' 'Three persons of one substance, power, and eternity,' 'Co-essential, co-substantial, co-equal,' 'The Son eternally begotten of the Father,' 'An eternal Son,' 'Humanity and divinity of Christ,' 'The Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the  Son,'  'God's  eternal  decrees,'  'Conditional  and  unconditional election and reprobation,' 'God out of Christ,' 'Free will,' 'Liberty and necessity,' 'Original sin,' 'Total depravity,' 'Covenant of grace,'7 'Effectual  calling,'  'Free  grace,'  'Sovereign  grace,'  'General  and particular atonement,' 'Satisfy divine justice,' 'Common and special operations of the Holy Ghost,' 'Imputed righteousness,' 'Inherent righteousness,'  'Progressive sanctification,' 'Justifying and saving faith,' 'Historic and temporary faith,' 'The direct and reflex acts of faith,' 'The faith of assurance, and the assurance of faith,' 'Legal repentance,' 'Evangelical repentance,' 'Perseverance of the saints,'8 and  'Falling  from  grace,'9  'Visible  and  invisible  church,'  'Infant membership,' 'Sacraments,' 'Eucharist,' 'Consubstantiation,' 'Church government,' 'The power of the keys,' etc. etc. 

Concerning these and all such doctrines, and all the speculations and  phraseology  to  which  they  have  given  rise,  we  have  the privilege neither to affirm nor deny — neither to believe nor doubt; because God has not proposed them to us in his word, and there is no  command  to  believe  them.  If  they  are  deduced  from  the Scriptures, we have them in the facts and declarations of God's Spirit; if they are not deduced from the Bible, we are free from all the difficulties and strifes which they have engendered and created. 

*We choose to speak of Bible things by Bible words,* because we are always suspicious that if the word is not in the Bible, the idea which  it  represents  is  not  there;  and  always  confident  that  the things taught by God are better taught in the words, and under the names which the Holy Spirit has chosen and appropriated, than in the words which man's wisdom teaches. 

There is nothing more essential to the union of the disciples of Christ  than  *purity*  of  speech.  So  long  as  the  earth  was  of  one speech, the human family was united. Had they been then of a pure speech  as  well  as  of  one  speech,  they  would  not  have  been separated. God, in his just indignation, dispersed them; and before he scattered them, *he divided their language.* One of his Prophets, who  lived  in  a  degenerate  age,  who  prophesied  against  the corruptions of his day, when he spoke of better times, of an age of union and communion, was commanded to say in the name of the Lord, 'Then will I turn to the people a *pure language,* that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him *with one consent.*'10 Purity of speech is here declared to be prerequisite to serving the Lord with one consent. 

'The words of the Lord are pure words.'11 To have a pure speech we  must  choose  the  language  of  Canaan,  and  abandon  that  of Ashdod. And if we would be of one mind, we must 'speak the same thing.' This was Paul's scheme of union, and no man can suggest a better. 

It requires but little reflection to discover that the fiercest disputes about religion, are about what the Bible does *not* say, rather than about what it *does* say — about words and phrases coined in the mint of  speculative  theology.  Of  these  the  *homousios*  and  the *homoousios*  of  the  ever-memorable  Council  of  Nice  are  a  fair sample. Men are neither wiser, more intelligent, nor better after, than  before,  they  know  the  meaning  of  these  words.  As  far  as known on earth, there is not, in 'the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,' the name of any person who was either converted or sanctified to God by any of these controversies about human dogmas, nor by anything learned from the canons or creeds of all the Councils, from that of Nice to the last Methodistic Conference. 

It is a virtue, then, to forget this scholastic jargon, and even the names of the dogmas which have convulsed Christendom. It is a concession due to the crisis in which we live, for the sake of peace, to adopt the vocabulary of Heaven, and to return the borrowed nomenclature of the schools of its rightful owners — to speculate no more upon the opinions  of Saint Austin, Saint  Tertullian, Saint Origen — to  speak  of  the  Father,  and  the  Son,  and  of  the  Holy Spirit — of  the  gospel,  of  faith,  of  repentance,  of  baptism,  of election, of the death of Christ, of his mediation, of his blood, of the reconciliation, of the Lord's supper, of the atonement, of the church of God, etc. etc. in all the phrases found in the Record, without partiality — to learn to love one another as much when we differ in opinion as when we agree, and to distinguish between the testimony of God, and man's reasonings and philosophy upon it.  

I need not say much upon the chapter of *human traditions.* They are easily distinguished from the *Apostles' traditions.* Those of the Apostles are found in their writings, as those of men are found in their  own  books.  Some  human  traditions  may  have  a  show  of wisdom, but only an appearance. So long as it is written, 'In vain to they  worship  me,  teaching  for  doctrines  the  commandments  of men,'  so  long  will  it  be  presumptuous  folly  to  add  the commandments of men to the precepts of Jesus Christ. I know of but one way in which all believers in Jesus Christ, honorably to themselves, honorably to the Lord, and advantageously to all the sons of Adam, can form one communion. All have two chapters too many in their present ecclesiastic constitutions. The contents of the aforesaid two chapters are various and different in all the sects, but they all have these two chapters under some name. In some they are long, and in some they are short; but whether long or short, let every one agree to tear them out of his book and burn them, and be satisfied with *faith, piety,* and *morality.* Let human philosophy  and  human  tradition,  as  any  part  of  the  Christian institution, be thrown overboard into the sea, and then the ship of the church will make a prosperous, safe, and happy voyage across the  ocean  of  time,  and  finally,  under  the  triumphant  flag  of Immanuel, gain a safe anchorage in the haven of eternal rest. 

I would appeal to every honorable, good, and loyal citizen of the kingdom of Heaven, — to every one that seeks the good of Zion, that loves the kingdom and the appearing of our common Lord and Savior, whether such a concession be not due to the Lord, to the saints in heaven and on earth, and to the whole human race in the crisis in which we are now placed; and whether we could propose less,  or  ought  to  demand  more,  than  to  make  one  whole  burnt offering of all our "empty and deceitful philosophy," — our "science, falsely so called," — and our traditions received from our fathers. I would  leave  it  to  the  good  sense  of  every  sane  mind  to  say, whether  such  a  whole  burnt  offering  would  not  be  the  most acceptable  peace  offering,  which,  in  this  our  day,  could  be presented on the altar of the Prince of Peace; and whether, under the  teachings  of  the  Apostles  of  the  Great  Prophet,  the  church might not again triumphantly stand upon the holy ground, which she so honorably occupied before Origen, Austin, Athanasius, or the first Pope was born!12

***GENERAL ESSAYS1*** 

1. Patriarchal Age of the World 

   The  world  has  its  infancy  as  well  as  man.  Families  preceded nations.  Family  worship  was,  therefore,  the  first  religious institution. 

At the head of this institution naturally stood *the father of every family.* From necessity and from choice, he was the prophet, the priest, and the king of his household. As a *prophet,* he instructed his household in the knowledge of God, and in the history of man. As a *priest,* he officiated at his family altar, interceded for those under his care, and pronounced benedictions upon his children. As a *lawgiver* and *king,* he commanded his children and servants, and rewarded them according to merit. By a divine ordinance, the *first fathers  of  mankind*  were  thus  constituted  prophets,  priests,  and kings. Hence, the first religious and political institution is properly called '*the Patriarchal.*' 

Family worship was, then, the *first social worship;* and during the first ages of the world (for at least 2500 years) it was the  *only social worship,* of divine authority. Though other institutions have since  been  added,  this  has  never  been  superseded.  Having  its foundation  in  the  matrimonial  compact,  the  most  ancient  of  all religious  and  political  institutions,  and  this  being  founded  on nature itself, it never can be superseded. While the forms of this worship have always been adapted to the genius of the various revelations  of  God  vouchsafed  to  mankind,  it  has  continued through all the changes of six thousand years, and will continue till the day when men, like angels of God, shall neither marry nor give in marriage. 

Family worship, so long as it continued the only social worship, underwent  no  material  change;  and  this  is  the  period  which  is properly called *the Patriarchal age of the world.* So long as the descendants  of  one  man  and  one  woman  continued  under  the paternal roof, or until they became heads of families themselves, they  continued  under  this  religious  and  political  administration. And if, after marriage, they did not migrate to a great distance from the  patrimonial  inheritance,  the  paternal  authority  was  still acknowledged and acquiesced in. Thus, in process of time, he who at  first  was  only  the  head  of  a  single  family,  if  his  days  were prolonged and his progeny multiplied, became the paternal prince, or chief patriarch of a tribe. 

In the youth of time and freshness of human nature, families soon became  large;  and  as  the  father  and  head  could  not  always  be present while he lived, and as he might die before all his children could have become heads of families, it became necessary that a substitute in his absence, and a successor in case of his premature death,  should  be  appointed  to  fill  his  place  and  administer  the affairs of the family. Nature and reason alike pointed to the first born son, and religion consecrated him his vicegerent. Hence, the privileges and honors of the first born son were both religious and political; and thus the duties devolving upon him gave him a right to a double portion of the inheritance. Esau was, therefore, both *prodigal* and *profane* in selling his birthright for a meal of pottage. 

The  antiquity  of  this  arrangement  appeared  from  the  envy  and jealousy of Cain, roused at the rejection of his offering and the acceptance  of  that  of  Abel.  That  jealousy  seems  to  have  been kindled into rage because of his birthright. This is fairly implied in God's address to Cain, when that address is fairly translated and understood. "If ye do well, shall you not have the excellency; and if you do not well, sin precludes you (from the excellency.) And (Abel shall be subject to you) to you shall be his desire, and you shall rule over him."2 

The moral and religious institutions of the patriarchal or family worship, which continued from the fall of Adam to the covenant of circumcision,  were  the  Sabbath,  the  service  of  the  altar,  oral instruction, prayer, praise, and benediction. With the addition of circumcision in the family of one patriarch, for special purposes these  were  the  parts  of  that  system  which  continued  for  two thousand five hundred years. 

The religious observance of weeks or Sabbaths in commemoration of Creation, and prospective of an eternal rest, to arise out of the sacrificial and typical institution, was religiously observed to the giving of the law, or the erection of the Jewish institution. Thus the law of the Sabbath commences with the words, "*Remember the sabbath.*"  The  righteous  always  remembered  the  weeks,  and regarded the conclusion of the week as holy to the Lord. Hence, even  after  the  apostasy,  which  issued  in  the  neglect  of  family worship, in consequence of the sons of God intermarrying with the daughters of men, and which brought a flood of water upon the world of the ungodly — we find Noah religiously counting his weeks even while incarcerated in the ark. In the wilderness of Sin, before the giving of the law, we also find the Jews observing the Sabbath. And to facilitate the observance of it, God wrought three special miracles  during  the  peregrinations  of  Israel.  He  gave  two  days' portion  of  manna  on  the  sixth  day — none  on  the  seventh — and preserved from putrefaction that portion laid up for the Sabbath.3 

Sin offerings and thank offerings, on altars both of stone and earth, were  presented  to  the  Lord — the  former  in  faith  of  the  promise concerning the bruising the serpent's head by the offspring of the woman — the latter in grateful acknowledgment of the goodness of God  in  creation  and  providence.  Cain,  without  faith  in  the promised redemption, like many deists and natural religionists in our time, did  acknowledge the  goodness  and care of God by a thank-offering; but Abel, *by faith in that promise,* not only offered his thank offering, but a lamb as a sin offering: therefore, while God respected not Cain's oblation without faith in that promise, he testified in favor of the *gifts* of Abel — he accepted his sin offering and his thank offering. 

In the very brief and general outlines of almost two thousand five hundred years given us in the book of Genesis, we find sundry allusions  to  this  part  of  the  patriarchal  institution.  Immediately after his egress from the ark, we find Noah rearing his altar upon the baptized earth, and of every clean bird and beast offering to the Lord whole burnt offerings. Thus began Noah, after the deluge, to worship the Lord according to the patriarchal institution. And thus we  find  Abraham,  Isaac,  Jacob,  Job,  and  other  patriarchs presenting their sacrifices to the Lord, while the family worship was the only religious institution to the world. 

Even libations, drink offerings, and anointing as token of gratitude and consecration, are found in this most ancient and venerable, institution. "Jacob rose  up early in  the  morning, took  the stone which he had put for his pillow, set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it."4 "And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where 

God talked with him, even a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon."5 

A beautiful and instructive instance of ancient family worship, and of  the  sacredotal  functions,  as  exercised  by  the  patriarchs  in reference  to  *the  altar,*  we  have  in  that  most  ancient  of  books, supposed by many to have been written by Moses while in the land of  Midian;  but  according  to  others,  by  Job  himself,  who  was certainly contemporary with *Eliphaz the Temanite.* Eliphaz was the son of Teman, who was the son of Eliphaz, who was the first son of Esau, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham. He therefore lived before Moses. Thus we find him also officiating at the altar. We are told that "his sons  went and feasted in each other's houses, every one his day, and sent and called for their sisters to eat and drink with them. And it was so, that when the days of their feasting had gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned  and  cursed  God  in  their  hearts.  Thus  acted  Job continually."6 

The same Job, by divine appointment, acted as priest or intercessor in behalf of his three friends, princes of Edom: for having spoken amiss, they were commanded to take seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to Job, the servant of God, and to offer them up for themselves; and "Job my servant shall pray for you." "Job prayed for them, and the Lord accepted his prayer, and forgave Eliphaz, Bildad,  and  Zophar."  "The  Lord  also  accepted  and  blessed  Job after he had prayed for these his friends, and the Lord turned again the captivity of Job."7 

During this period of the world, there was but one high or general priest, specially called and sent by God. "He was King of Salem and Priest of the Most High God." To him the patriarch Abraham paid  tithes  or  gave  the  tenth  of  the  spoils  taken  in  war,  and Melchisedeck blessed him. He was of an order of his own sort. He had  no  predecessor,  successor,  nor  equal  in  the  age  of  family worship. 

From all these facts and documents we learn that the service of the altar belonged first to the father of the family — next, to his eldest son — that  it  consisted  in  presenting  sin  offerings  and  thank offerings of various sorts in behalf of himself or family — that all pious sons and individuals might *for themselves* erect altars, offer sacrifices,  and  pour  out  libations  and  thank  offerings  to  the Lord; — that  these  sacrificial  observances  were  generally,  if  not always,  accompanied  with  prayer,  intercession,  and thanksgivings; — and that intercession in behalf of those under the care of any father or patriarch was a part of the first institution. 

Benediction also was one of the first duties of this office. Fathers pronounced  blessings  on  their  children.  Superiors  in  age  and standing blessed their inferiors. Melchisedeck blessed Abraham, Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob blessed the twelve patriarchs. The invocations  of  blessings  and  the  imposition  of  hands  upon  the head, were parts of the family worship institution. 

Concerning  prayer  and  praise,  as  we  cannot  imagine  a  religion without them, it is unnecessary to speak particularly of them as parts of the patriarchal institution. Jubal soon taught men to handle the harp and organ, and piety soon consecrated them to the praise of God. The melodies of nature soon taught men to tune his voice to God. Isaac went into the fields at eventide for secret prayer. Abraham interceded for Sodom until he was ashamed to push his importunities farther; and for Abimelech, king of Egypt, and his family, he made his requests to God. Of him and his patriarchal character God said, "I know Abraham that he will command his children, and his household after him, and they shall keep the ways of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him."8 

Prophets of a public character were occasionally raised up to bring men back to the primitive simplicity of the patriarchal institution, as  well  as  to  lead  them  forward  to  the  future  developments  of God's purposes in reference to this work of redemption. Amongst these the most conspicuous were Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. To all these were given new visions of the future, and thus they  were  all  preachers  of  righteousness  and  reformers  in  their respective generations. 

From these gleanings from the book of Genesis, one may learn that the family worship institution, which was divinely instituted in the first age of the world, embraced the observance of the Sabbath, the service  of  the  altar,  oral  instruction,  prayer,  intercession, thanksgiving, and benediction. It contemplated no other bond of union than the marriage covenant, and the relations springing out of it. Doing justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God, were  enforced  in  all  its  maxims,  and  in  the  examples  of  those whom God honored and approved. 

There was, during the long period of this family institution, no community  separated  from  the  world  larger  than  a  single household — no public altars — no temples — no established order of public teachers; therefore, there were no initiating or separating institutions. There was no *circumcision* for the infant, nor *washing of regeneration* for the instructed. These institutions of latter times had respect to public professing communities; and therefore, for two  thousand  years  there  was  no  initiating  rite  or  ordinance amongst men. 

Wherever the family curtains were spread and a tent erected, the devout father built his own altar to the Lord, gathered his own children  and  domestics  around  him,  instructed  them  in  the knowledge  of  God  the  creator  and  preserver  of  all;  and  in  the history of man, his origin and destiny, as far as revealed to them. They  offered  their  thank  offerings,  acknowledgments  of  favors received;  and  when  conscious  of  sin,  they  presented  their  sin offering,  with  confessions,  and  in  faith  of  God's  promise, supplicated  pardon.  Such  are  the  essential  attributes  of  the patriarchal institution, and of the family worship, as learned from the writings of Moses. 

But as the root of all subsequent dispensations of God's mercy and favor  to  man  was  planted  in  the  patriarchal  institution,  it  is necessary  to  our  plan,  before  we  advance  farther,  to  pay  some attention to one of the patriarchs, whose fame is eternal, on whom God bestowed an honor above all earthly honor, and who stands enrolled in the annals of time as **the friend of god**. The intelligent reader needs not  to  be  informed that we now  call his  attention specially to Abraham.  

***Abraham*** 

Reader, attend! "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial to  all  generations."  And  shall  not  the  name,  the  calling,  the blessing, and the history of Abraham always occupy large space in the records of God's government of man, and in all the details of his redemption! 

Because of his unprecedented faith in God's promises and exalted piety, he was constituted the *father of all believers;* and his whole life is made a model for all the children of God, as far as walking by faith in God's promises is an ornament to human character. 

Sufficient, then, to our present purpose, we observe, that *during the family worship institution,* a little after the commencement of the third Millennium, about the 75th year of his life, God appeared to Abraham while he yet lived in Ur of Chaldea, and commanded him to depart out of that country, and that he would do for him certain things.  Abraham  obeyed.  God  gratuitously  tendered  him  *two promises,* not only interesting and valuable to Abraham himself, but to all the human race. 

These two promises were intended to be the basis of a two-fold relation  to  God,  and  the  foundation  of  two  distinct  religious institutions,  called  "the  Old  Testament  and  the  New,"  "the  Old Covenant and the New," "the Two Covenants," and "the Covenants of Promise." These are contemplated in them the constitution for a temporal and spiritual kingdom of God — a kingdom of God of this world, and a kingdom of God not of this world. Be it, therefore, always remembered, when we attempt to form correct views of the whole economy of God's redemption, that these two promises were made while the patriarchal institution was yet standing and several centuries before its close. What, then, it will be asked, are these two promises?  

***Two Promises?*** 

We find them in their most simple form in the beginning of the 12th chapter of Genesis.  

**The first — **"*I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing. I will bless them that bless thee, curse them that curse thee.*" 

**The second** — "*In thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.*" 

These  promises,  when  fully  developed,  contained  numerous blessings.  They  are,  however,  in  all  their  details  separate  and distinct from each other. Abraham's family alone are personally concerned  in  the  first — all  families  of  the  earth  in  the  second. Temporal and earthly are the blessings of the former — spiritual and eternal are the blessings of the latter. Paul calls the second, "The gospel preached to Abraham," and "The covenant confirmed by God in reference to the Messiah, four hundred and thirty  years before the giving of the law." The Jewish kingdom in all its glory was but the development of the first — the Christian kingdom in its present and future blessings is the consummation of the second. 

***Covenant of Circumcision*** 

In pursuance of the first promise, and in order to its exact and literal  accomplishment,  about  twenty-four  years  after  its promulgation of "*Covenant of Circumcision*" was established. This "covenant  in  the  flesh,"  marked  out  and  defined  the  natural descendants of Abraham, and gave to the world a full proof of the faithfulness  of  God,  putting  it  in  the  power  of  every  one  to ascertain how God keeps his covenant of promise with his people. This  gave  to  the  descendants  of  Abraham  the  title  of  "The Circumcision," and beautifully represented the separation of God's people from the children of this world.  

The land of Canaan, as *the inheritance* of this nation, is repeatedly promised to Abraham; and as soon as Isaac, the child of promise, is born  and  circumcised,  the  promise  of  the  "**seed**"  in  which  all nations were to be blessed, is confined to him. Not in Ishmael, but "in Isaac, shall *thy seed* be called."9 

After the death of Abraham and towards the close of the life of Isaac, his  father's  God  gave him a second edition  of these two promises. The first is considerably amplified in its details, while the second is repeated almost in the same words. That which was first  to  be  accomplished  is  first  developed,  and  its  provisions pointed out. "I will be with thee and will bless thee; for unto thee and to thy seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform all the oath which I sware to Abraham thy father; and will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."10

The same two promises are repeated in almost the same words to Jacob, the son of Isaac at the time he had the vision of the ladder reaching from earth to heaven, while, in obedience to a command given him by his parents, he was on his way to Padan-aram in quest of a wife. On these *three* great occasions — to Abraham — to Isaac — to  Jacob — these  two  promises  are  solemnly  pronounced; always  standing  in  the  same  order — never  confounded;  but  as distinct as earth and heaven — as time and eternity. 

Four hundred and thirty years after the first solemn declaration of these promises, the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in virtue of the promise, were redeemed out of bondage, in Egypt, and saved from the tyranny and cruelty of Pharaoh. Then, in order to  the  *full  completion*  of  its  stipulations,  God,  by  the  hand  of Moses, proposed a covenant with all Israel at Sinai; in which he guarantees  to  do  all  for  them  contemplated  in  the  promise, confirmed by an oath to Abraham, in being a God to his seed after him.  

***Sinaitic Covenant*** 

This Sinaitic constituted them a kingdom of God, a holy nation, a peculiar  people.  All  the  blessings  comprehended  in  the  first promise to Abraham, or that could grow out of the relation to God, which  it  contemplated,  were  in  full  detail  carried  out  into  this transaction,  and  secured  to  the  whole  nation.  The  relation  was, however,  temporal,  and  its  blessings  temporal  and  earthly.  The second promise made no part of the Jewish institution or covenant at  Sinai,  more  than  it  did  of  the  patriarchal  or  antecedent institution. The typical or figurative part of the family worship, enlarged and improved, was translated into the *national* institution and made a part of it; and whatever *spiritual* privilege was enjoyed by  the  Jew,  was  enjoyed  upon  the  same  principle  with  the patriarch — by faith in the second promise, and by an intelligent and believing attendance upon all the  appointed means which either prefigured the coming redemption, or realized the blessings which were to be derived through the promised seed. 

The **seed** in which all the families of the earth were to be blessed, was in the nation, but in no other sense than as it was in the people while in Egypt, or in the patriarchs before they went down into Egypt.  It  was  in  the  nation,  but  no  element  of  the  national institution. They had the second promise made to their fathers, and all the faithful and approved among them believed that promise, and acted conformably to it. Thus amongst the Jews, even before the coming of the Messiah, they were 

***Two Seeds*** 

The  natural  and  the  spiritual  children  of  Abraham.  The  whole nation were his literal and natural children; and such of them as believed the second promise and understood it were not only his natural children, but his children in the same sense in which all *believing Gentiles* are by virtue of the second promise constituted the  children  of  Abraham.  The  first,  like  Ishmael,  were  born according to the flesh — the fleshy seed of Abraham; the second, like  Isaac,  were  the  children  of  faith  in  the  promise:  and  thus Abraham  is  the  constituted  father  of  all  who  believe  in  that promise, whether of his flesh or not. 

But the second promise was not fulfilled for nearly one thousand five hundred years after the first, or after the national institution was confirmed at Sinai; and therefore  

***The Blessings of Abraham*** 

Which as to come on the nations through his seed, through faith in the accomplished promises, was to be the basis and the substance of a new institution. This "blessing of Abraham" includes all the spiritual and eternal blessings which are laid up in his seed, who is the ark of this new constitution, in whom all the promises of God are verified, and in whom they are deposited for the comfort and salvation of all the faithful children of God. Whatever concerned the  family  of  Abraham,  coming  through  the  first  promise, descended  upon  the  family  principle  which  is  only  *flesh;*  but whatever concerns all saints of all nations descends upon the new principle of *faith.* "They who are of faith," says Paul, "are blessed with believing Abraham." And "If you be Christ's, then" and only then, "are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise." 

The blessing of Abraham was then promised in the patriarchal age antecedent to the Jewish national institution, and independent of it; therefore  that  institution  cannot  affect,  much  less  disannul,  the blessings  promised  in  the  covenant,  confirmed  before  by  God, respecting the Messiah, in the time of family worship, and four hundred and thirty years before the Jewish institution began. 

In calling Abraham, and in making him the father of many nations, and the depository of still more precious promises and revelations, God did not supersede the family worship. He only added to the stock of religious knowledge, strengthened the faith, and enlarged the hopes of that single family. The family institution continued without the slightest change, except in one particular specified in the  covenant  of  circumcision,  as  respected  the  single  family  of Abraham,  for  four  hundred  and  thirty  years  after  the  charter concerning his seed and that concerning the Messiah were secured to this renowned patriarch. Thus we have traced the continuance of the family religion, or patriarchal economy, for two thousand five hundred years, and are now prepared to make a few remarks on the Jewish  national  institution,  though  we  have  already  anticipated almost all that is necessary to our present object. Still, however, we shall make it the object of a distinct notice. (See Next Essay) 

2. The Jewish Institution 

In this age of improvement of divine institutions, we read and hear much of "two dispensations of the covenant of grace;" thus making the  Jewish  and  the  Christian  institutions  dispensations  of  one "covenant  of  grace."  Why  not  make  the  patriarchal,  (still  more venerable for its antiquity, and which continued a thousand years longer than the Jewish,) also  a dispensation of  the covenant  of grace, and then we should have had  *three* dispensations of one covenant? This is but a "*show* of wisdom." The Holy Spirit calls them  "two  covenants,"  or  "two  institutions,"  and  not  two modifications of one covenant; and it speaks of each as established upon  promises.  The  Jewish  was  established  upon  temporal  and earthly promises, contained in the first promise made to Abraham; but  the  new,  says  Paul,  "is  established  upon  *better  promises,*" growing out of that concerning *the blessing of the nations* in the promised seed.11

The Jewish institution commenced and continued about 1500 years before the Reign of Heaven began. It was not substituted for the family worship, but added to it; affecting, however, the patriarchal institution in some respects, as far as concerned the single family of Abraham. The individual families of the nation of the Jews, *as such,* had still their family worship — still the worship of God was heard in the dwellings of the righteous; and, like Joshua, every good Israelite said, "As for me and my family, we will serve the Lord." 

In four hundred years the family of Abraham had, in the line of Isaac and Jacob, in fulfilment of the first promise, grown up into millions. Not less than two millions12 came up out of Egypt under the  conduct  of  Moses.  The  heavenly  Father,  in  progressive development of his plan of blessing all nations, leaves all the world under the family worship institution, and erects the whole progeny of  Abraham  that  came  up  out  of  Egypt  into  one  great  national institution. He condescends to appear in the character of *King of the Jews,* and to make them a *kingdom of God,* as preparatory to the appearance of his *Son,* who is predestined to be the King of the whole  earth,  and  to  have  a  kingdom  which  shall  ultimately embrace all the nations of the world.  

The  twelve  tribes  were  brought  into  the  form  of  one  great worshipping family, presenting through the common High Priest their united worship to God. This gave rise to the erection of one public house consecrated to the Lord, as the place of meeting in their social and national character. A constitution, political, moral, and religious, was submitted to the people; and on their adoption of it, they became the covenanted people of God. This constitutional kingdom was built upon precepts and promises; and its worship when fully developed was  little more than the extension of the family worship to one great national family. They had one king, one high priest, one national altar, one national house of God, one morning and evening service, one great national sacrifice, and one great annual atonement. The nation was a family of families, and whatever pertained to a single family in its family worship was extended and accommodated to this great confederate family. 

Various mystic and significant institutions distinguished this nation from all others; for it was one principal object of its institution to keep its subjects separate and distinct from all other people till Messiah (the promised seed) should come. Another object was, to picture  out  in  appropriate  types  the  spiritual  worship  of  the kingdom  of  heaven,  and  to  exhibit  the  great  doctrines  of  faith, repentance,  remission, adoption, and inheritance, by  picturesque images, ingeniously devised to adumbrate the whole doctrine of reconciliation and sanctification to God. 

The Jewish institution is not to be regarded only in its political, moral, and religious aspects, but especially in its figurative and prospective character. God so wisely and benevolently contrived it from its origin to its close, that its whole history — the fates and fortunes of its subjects from their descent into Egypt, their travels thence  to  Canaan  and  settlement  in  the  land  of  promise — their fortunes in that land to their final catastrophe, should exactly and impressively shadow forth the new institution with the fates and fortunes of the subjects of this new and more glorious order of things. "All these things happened to them for *types,*" (examples,) says Paul, "and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world have come." The same great commentator on this  institution  not  only  presents  the  history  of  its  subjects  as instructive  to  the  citizens  of  the  new  institution,  but  of  the tabernacle he says, "It was a figurative representation for the time then present," and the furniture thereof "the patterns of things in the heavens." "The law," he adds, "contained only a shadow of the good things to come." A shadow, indeed, proceeding from a man, a house,  a  tree,  is  not,  and  cannot  be,  an  exact  image  or representation  of  them;  yet,  when  explained  by  a  verbal description, it greatly facilitates an easy and correct conception of them. 

So full of the doctrine of the new institution was the old, that we find  all  the  Apostles  and  Christian  writers  unceremoniously applying every thing they quote from the law, the prophets, and the psalms,  to  the  Messiah,  his  kingdom,  and  the  fortunes  of  his people; as if the Jewish writings had no other object than to unfold the kingdom of heaven. Jesus begins with Abraham seeing his day on Mount Moriah in the typical resurrection of Isaac. Paul regards Hagar,  Ishmael,  Sarah, Isaac, as  the best  illustration of the  *two institutions;* and John ends with the description of the descent of Jerusalem from heaven. 

Every one, then, who would accurately understand the Christian institution must approach it through the Mosaic; and he that would be a proficient in the Jewish, must make Paul his commentator. While the mere politician, moralist, or religionist, contemplate the one without the other, though he may find much to admire in both, he  will  never  understand  either.  A  veil,  thick  as  that  which concealed the glory of the face of Moses from the Israelites, will hide the glory of the Jewish and Christian institutions from his view. 

Not only did the tabernacle, the temple, their furniture, the service of both, the priests, the sacrifices, the festivals, the convocations, and all the ordinances of that Ritual, together with the history of that people, assume the picturesque and figurative character, but almost all the illustrious and highly distinguished personages of that institution were made prophetic or typical of the Messiah or of the great incidents of his life, sufferings, and triumphs, and the leading  affairs  of  his  government.  Amongst  *persons*  in  the patriarchal  and  Jewish  ages  who,  in  one  or  more  prominent characters or incidents, or in their general history adumbrated the Messiah  and  his  reign,  the  following  group  occupy  a  lofty eminence: — Adam,  Abel,  Noah,  Melchisedeck,  Isaac,  Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Samson, David, Jonah. Of *things* of this class, as well as persons highly figurative and instructive, are the visions of Jacob's ladder — the burning bush — the pillar of cloud and fire — the manna — the rock Horeb, a fountain of living water in the wilderness — the veil of Moses — the brazen serpent — the victory over the nations of Canaan, and the land of Canaan itself. And of *ordinances,* the passover, the scape goat, the red heifer, the year of jubilee, the law of the leper, the kinsman redeemer, the cities of refuge; together with all the sacrifices, washings, anointings, and consecrations of the *holy* nation. 

But  a  third  object  of  the  Jewish  institution,  of  paramount importance to the world, was the furnishing of a new alphabet and language  (the  elements  of  heavenly  science,)  without  which  it would appear to have been almost, if not altogether, impossible to learn  the  spiritual  things,  or  to  make  any  proficiency  in  the knowledge  of  those  relations  which  Christianity  unfolds.  The language of the new institution is therefore explained by that of the old. No one can understand the dialect of the kingdom of heaven who has not studied the dialect of the antecedent administrations of heaven  over  the  patriarchs  and  Jews.  The  most  striking  and characteristic attribute of the sacred dialect is, that the elements of it  are  composed  of  the  incidents  of  history,  or  what  we  call *remarkable providences.* 

I  cannot  explain  myself  better,  not  render  my  readers  a  more essential service, than by illustrating by an actual detail of sacred history, the following proposition, viz.: — *That sacred history or the remarkable  instances  of  God's  providence  to  the  Jews  and Patriarchs, are the foundation  of  the sacred dialect  of  the new institution.* Or, if the reader will understand it better, it may be expressed — *All  the  leading  words  and  phrases  of  the  New Testament are to be explained and understood by the history of the Jewish nation and God's government of them.* Take the following as a mere specimen: —  

God *called* Abram out of Ur, and changed his name into *Abraham;* and the name of his wife Sarai into *Sarah.* He *promised* Isaac as the  person  in  whom  his  *seed*  should  be  *called.*  God  did  *tempt* Abraham,  commanding  him  to  *offer*  Isaac  for  a  burnt offering — Isaac  had  two  sons — Esau  the  elder,  and  Jacob  the younger. Esau *despised* his *birthright* and *sold* it to Jacob. Jacob wrestled with God, and *prevailed;* he obtained a blessing, and was therefore called *Israel.* He had *twelve* sons: of these Joseph was his favorite. His brethren *envied* him, and *sold* him for twenty pieces of silver. Joseph *found grace* in the sight of his master. *The Lord was with Joseph.* He was cast into prison, and from thence was elevated  to  the  *governor*  of  Egypt  under  Pharaoh.  A  famine  in Canaan compelled Jacob and his sons into Egypt for bread, and Joseph was *made known* to his brethren. Joseph died in Egypt and left his father's house in the land. They multiplied exceedingly, and the Egyptians greatly *afflicted* and *oppressed* the Israelites. *Moses* was born and exposed: Pharaoh's daughter found him and *adopted* him for a son. Moses fled into Midian, and married the daughter of the priest or prince of Midian, and kept his father-in-law's flock in the *desert,* and came to Horeb, *the mountain of God.* The Lord appeared to him in *a flame of fire* in a bush. The bush burned and was not consumed. Moses *drew near,* and then first stood on *holy ground.* God *sent* him to Egypt to lead *his* people out of *bondage.* 

God made him say to the *children of Israel,* '**I am** has sent me to you. Gather the *elders* of Israel and say to them, *The Lord God* of your fathers, the God of Abraham,' etc. 'has sent me to you. I will *smite*  Egypt  with  my  *wonders,*  and  *bring  you  up  out  of  the afflictions* of Egypt. Tell Pharaoh, Israel is *my son — my first born.* Take Aaron with thee, and thou shalt *put words into his mouth;* and I will be *with thy mouth* and with his mouth: he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him *instead of God.* Take thy *rod* in thy hand. The Lord *sent* Aaron to Moses: he met him in the mount and *kissed* him. And the Lord *visited* his people. And the people *believed when they heard* that the Lord had *looked upon* their affliction. Pharaoh oppressed them still more. The Lord said, with a *strong hand* shall he let them go. I will *redeem* them with a stretched  out  arm,  and  with  great  *judgments.*  I  will  give  you Canaan for a *heritage;* I will take you to me *for a people. I will be your God.*' 

Moses  said,  I  am  a  man  of  *uncircumcised  lips,*  and  how  shall Pharaoh *hearken* to me? I have made thee a *god* to Pharaoh, and Aaron *thy prophet.*  I will  multiply my  *signs,*  and bring out  *my people,* and *harden* Pharaoh's heart. When he says, "Show me a miracle," cast your rod before him, and *it shall become* a serpent. Still  Pharaoh  refused,  and  *hardened  his  heart.*  The  magicians overcome with the *signs,* said, *This is the finger of God.* The *God of the Hebrews* said, Let *my people go.* I have *roused* thee up (as a lion)  to  show  in  you  my  power,  and  to  make  *my  name  known* through *all the earth.* The Lord slew all the *first born* of Egypt after he had *plagued* them exceedingly. Pharaoh commanded them to depart; but he pursued them to the Red Sea. Israel fainted at the sight before and behind them. Moses said, Stand still and see *the salvation  of  God.*  The  sea  was  divided.  Covered  with  a  cloud, Israel marched through  as  on dry  ground. The  waters stood on either  side  as  a  wall.  Pharaoh  pursued  with  his  chariots  and horsemen, but the waters returned, and they were drowned. Thus the  Lord *redeemed, saved, delivered, and brought  Israel  out  of bondage.* 

After this deliverance, Moses and the children of Israel sang, "The Lord is become *my salvation;* he is *my God.* Thou hast overthrown them  that  *rose  up  against  thee.*  Thou  hast  *led  forth  thy  people* whom thou *hast redeemed.* Thou *hast guided them* in thy strength to thy *holy habitation.* The inhabitants of Canaan shall be still as a stone  till  *thy  people*  pass  over,  O  Lord,  the  people  *thou  hast purchased.*  Thou  shalt  plant  them  in  the  mountain  of  *thine inheritance;* in the *sanctuary* which *thy hands* have *established.*" 

They came into *the wilderness of Sin.* They cried for bread, and God *rained bread from heaven upon them,* that he might *prove* them whether or not they would *walk in his law,* and they did eat manna forty years till they came to the borders of Canaan. 

They complained for water, and tempted God. And Moses *smote the rock* in Horeb, and water gushed out. But Moses was wroth, and smote the rock twice, and he and Aaron thus *rebelled* against God, and fell in the wilderness. The Lord made a covenant with the whole nation at Sinai, and made them a *peculiar treasure* above all people — a *kingdom of priests,* a *holy nation;* and God *spake* all the words of the law, written on two tables of stone; and  *spake to Israel from heaven.* 

The Lord, by Moses, gave them directions for rearing a *tabernacle,* and a pattern for all its furniture. And as *a ransom for his soul,* every man, rich and poor, was to pay half a shekel as an *offering to the Lord* to *make an atonement* for his soul; and it was given for *the service* of the tabernacle. When the tabernacle was reared and finished, *the glory of the Lord* filled the tabernacle and the *cloud* covered it. And when the cloud *was taken up,* they journeyed; but until it was taken up, they journeyed not. The *cloud* was on the tabernacle by day, and *fire* was on it by night, in the sight of all Israel throughout all their journeys. 

And before Moses died he *laid his hands* upon Joshua, and gave him a *charge* as the *Lord commanded;* and thus put *honor* upon him, that the children of Israel might be *obedient* to him as their *savior.* "As I was *with Moses,* so will I be *with thee*," saith God: "I will not fail thee nor *forsake* thee." 

Could we thus proceed with the history of this people, and add to their  history  the  observance  of  their  religious  institutions,  we should find out the true meaning of the sacred style of the New Testament  with  more  accuracy  and  certainty,  than  from  all  the commentators  of  ancient  and  modern  times.  This,  as  a  sample, must suffice for our present purpose. 

From the premises now before us, the specifications of the outlines of the Sinaitic and national institution, and the terms and phrases found  in  the  history  of  this  people,  we  may  discover  in  what *relation* they stood to  God, and what  *favors*  he bestowed upon them in that relation. 

They were *called* and *chosen,* or the *elect* of God as a nation. As such,  they  were  *delivered,  saved,  bought,*  or  *purchased,*  and *redeemed.* God is said to have *created, made, formed,* and *begotten* them. As such he is called their *Father,* their *God,* their *Redeemer,* their *King,* their *Savior,* their *Salvation;* and they are called his *children,  sons*  and  *daughters;  born  to  him,*  his  *house,  people, inheritance, family, servants.* 

As a *chartered* and congregated people, they are called *the city, the holy city, the city of the Lord, Jerusalem, Zion, Mount Zion, the city of David.* Other nations in contrast with them, are called *not a people, aliens, strangers, enemies, far off, unclean.* 

Various similitudes expressive of the kind relation in which they stood  to  God  are  also  found  in  the  pages  of  the  ancient institutions — such as *husband* and *wife, shepherd* and *flock, vine* and *vineyard, mother* and *children.* They are said to be *written* or *enrolled* in *the book of God;* to be *planted, washed, sanctified, clean,  separated  to  God;*  they  are  called  *the  house,  building, sanctuary, dwelling place* of God; *a kingdom of priests, a holy nation, a peculiar people, saints,* etc. 

Those who are curious to trace these phrases descriptive of the relation and privileges of this ancient kingdom of God, had better (in addition to the passages quoted in their history from Egypt to the  Jordan,)  examine  the  following  passages: —   Exodus  14:30; 15:16;  19:6;  Deut.  4:37;  7:6;  10:15;  14:1;  1:31;  7:5;  32:6; 32:18-19; 18:7; 3:18, 20; 12:9. 1 Kings 3:8. Psalm 105:6; 33:13; 105:43; 106:5, 21; 124:2; 149:2. Isa 41:8-9, 43:1, 3, 5, 7; 51:2, 4. Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Psalms of David throughout, etc. 

Unless  we  should  write  a  full  treatise  on  these  antecedent institutions, we cannot with propriety descend farther into details. The outlines, as far as subordinate to the theme of this essay, are now  before  the  reader;  and  with  this  preparation  we  shall  now invite his attention to **the kingdom of heaven.** 

3. The Kingdom of Heaven 

And why, an *American* would say, is it not called the *Republic* of Heaven, and the Chief called the *President* of a Celestial Republic? Certainly there were the Republics of Greece and Rome before the doctrine of this Kingdom was first promulged, and the Gentiles as well as the Jews could have understood the figure of a Republic as well as that of a Kingdom. It was not, then, because there was not in society a model or type of this sort; but because such a type would have been inapposite to the nature of this institution. 

History testifies that Republics are better adapted to peace than war,  and  that  they  are  forced  and  unnatural  organizations  of society. Aristocracies and Republics owe all their attractions to the excessive corruptions of the governments under which they have originated. They are the reaction of force and fraud, of cruelty and oppression,  and  are  sustained  by  the  remembrance  and apprehension  of  the  evils  which  occasioned  them.  They  have always been extolled or admired either in contrast with vices and enormities  of  degenerate  and  profligate  monarchies,  or  in  the freshness of the recollections of the wrongs and outrages which have occasioned them; and men have generally tired of them when they became corrupt and forgetful of the oppressions and crimes which  forced  them  into  being.  So  that  the  corruptions  of monarchies have given birth to Republics, and the corruptions of these have originated monarchies again. 

In these last days of degeneracy, Republics are great blessings to mankind, as good physicians are blessings in times of pestilence; but yet it must be confessed that it would be a greater blessing to be  without  plagues  and  doctors.  While  men  are,  however,  so degenerate, and while selfishness and injustice are so rampant in society, republican officers are better than kings — because we can get rid of them sooner. They are indeed, kings under another name, with  a  short-leased  authority;  and  our  experience  fully demonstrates  that  in  these  degenerate  days  the  reigns  of  our republican kings are nearly long enough. Till the King of kings comes,  we  Christians  ought  to  be  good  republicans,  under  the conviction that human governments seldom grow better, and that the popular doctrine of our country is true — that political authority generally makes a man worse, and public favors almost invariably corrupt the heart. Rapid rotation in office is the practical influence of the republican theory; and the experiment proves that, brief as republican  authority  is,  it  is  sometimes  too  long  for  republican virtue  to  sustain  without  deterioration.  Now  if  this  be  true  of republican virtue, the brightest and the best, what earthly virtue can long resist the contamination of long protracted authority! 

Monarchy is the only form of government, however, which nature recognizes. It was the first, and it will be the last. A government with three or thirty heads is a monster; and therefore the beast that represents it comes out of the sea with a plurality of horns as well as heads. 

The  most  approved  theory  of  human  nature  and  of  human government now current wherever the English language is spoken, either in the Old World or in the New, is that a monarchy would be always  the  best  government,  because  the  cheapest,  the  most efficient, and the most dignified; provided only, that the crown was placed on the wisest head and the sceptre wielded by the purest hands.  Could  we  always  secure  this  we  would  be  monarchists: because we cannot, we are all republicans. 

But,  after  this  apology  for  the  phrase  *Kingdom  of  Heaven,*  we would recall the attention of the reader to the concession, made by republicans themselves, that a kingdom is better adapted to a state of  war,  than  a  republic;  and  that  this  beautiful,  though  most appropriate figure, which occurs in the New Testament more than one hundred and fifty times, and very often in the Old, presupposes a  state  of  war  as  existing  in  the  universe.  But  for  the  reasons assigned in preference of a monarchy, the *natural* government of the universe always was, is, and evermore shall be monarchy. God himself is of necessity absolute monarch of the universe. Had he not  essentially  sustained  that  relation  to  all  his  creatures,  there never  could  have  been  rebellion  nor  sin  in  his  dominions.  The systems of nature are all after this model. Every sun is a king over the  system  which  it  controls;  and  in  every  sphere  there  is  one controlling and supreme principles. It will be the last government; for  when  the  episode  in  the  great  drama  of  *rational*  existence which sin occasioned, shall have been completed, the government of the universe will assume its ancient order, and God be supreme monarch again. But this will not be till Jesus gives up the kingdom to God which a preternatural state of things put into his hands. This cannot be till he has subdued man to his rightful allegiance, or destroyed forever every opponent to the absolute monarchy of the Eternal Supreme: "for Jesus must reign till all his enemies be put under his feet." 

The kingdom which Jesus has received from his Father, however heavenly,  sublime,  and  glorious  it  may  be  regarded,  is  only temporal. It had a beginning, and it will have an end; for he must reign only *till* all enemies are put under his feet. But the transition of the sceptre into the hands of Emmanuel has not changed the government. He is now the hereditary Monarch of the universe, as well as the proper King of his own kingdom. He now reigns as absolutely over all principalities, hierarchs, and powers, celestial and terrestrial, as did the great God and Father of the universe, before he was invested with the regal authority. 

We have said it was a preternatural state of things which originated the kingdom of Jesus: therefore the object of this remedial reign is to destroy that preternatural state of things — to put down sin. Now as  all  human  governments  presuppose  disorder,  and  as  the kingdoms of this world generally have risen out of confusion and war, the kingdom of heaven of which we are to speak owes its origin to the celestial and terrestrial apostacies — the revolt of Satan and of Adam. Were there no justice within, or violence without, civil government would be wholly unnecessary, and its appendages an excresence upon society. Had there not been such a revolt and rebellion as sacred history records, there would have been no such kingdom  of  heaven  as  that  over  which  Jesus  the  Messiah  now presides.  Now  as  both  this  King  and  kingdom,  and  all  that appertains to them, were occasioned by such a preternatural state of things, we must view them in all their attributes and details, with reference to those circumstances which called them into being. 

***The Elements of a Kingdom*** 

We  must  understand  the  type,  or  we  cannot  understand  the antitype. We must understand that which is natural before we can understand  that  which  is  spiritual.  What,  then  are  the  essential elements of a kingdom as existing among men? They are five, viz: King,  Constitution,  Subjects,  Laws,  and  Territory.  Such  are  the essential parts of every political kingdom, perfect in its kind, now existing on earth. 

In *forming a state,* the essential elements are people and country. The  people  make  a  constitution,  and  this  makes  a  President  or King, citizens or subjects, and every thing else belonging to a state. It is, then, the relation into which the people resolve themselves, which make it a republic, an aristocracy, a monarchy. Do they choose a monarchy? They first make a constitution, and this places one upon the throne — makes them subjects, and then gives them laws. Although the constitution is first, in the order of nature, of all the elements of a kingdom, for it makes one man a king and the rest subjects; yet we cannot imagine a constitution in reference to a kingdom, without king and subjects. In speaking of them in detail, we cannot then speak of any one of them as existing without the others — we  must  regard  them  as  correlates,  and  as  coming  into existence contemporaneously. There is no husband nor wife before marriage, neither can there be a husband without a wife; yet one of the  parties  must  be  made  before  the  other.  Marriage  makes  a husband out of a bridegroom, and a wife out of the bride. So the constitution  makes  the  king  or  the  governor;  the  citizens  or subjects, out of the people, as the case may be; for there never can be a king or subject without a constitution, or, what is the same thing,  an  agreement,  verbal  or  written,  for  certain  privileges stipulated  and  conditioned.  In  every  well  regulated  political kingdom,  *in  the  order  of  nature,*  the  elements  stand  thus.  1. Constitution; 2. King; 3. Subjects; 4. Laws; 5. Territory.  

In the kingdom which God set up by Moses, the elements stood in this order. The constitution was first proposed under which God condescended to be their King, and they were to be regarded as his people or subjects; he then gave them laws and established them in the territory before promised. 

But in the kingdom of nature, or in the original kingdom of God, the elements are only four, and the order in which they stand are: 1. King; 2. Subjects; 3. Laws; 4. Territory. As Father and Creator of the kingdom, God himself was absolute Sovereign, whose will is the supreme law of the whole realm of nature. 

Having  ascertained  the  essential  elements  of  a  *kingdom,*  and marked the order in which they stand, before we particularly attend to  those  elements  in  order,  we  shall  ask,  Why  this  kingdom  is called the kingdom of *Heaven?* 

***The Name*** 

Heaven, and the Kingdom of Heaven are not one and the same thing. God is not the Kingdom of God. But as the kingdom of God is  something  pertaining  to  God,  so  the  Kingdom  of  Heaven  is something pertaining to heaven, and consequently to God. Whether always the phrases "the Kingdom of God" and the "Kingdom of heaven" exactly represent the same thing, certain it is that both phrases are often applied to the same institution.13

This is true of them, whether translated *reign* or *kingdom;* and it is very evident that frequently the original world *basileia* ought in preference to be rendered *reign,* inasmuch as this term better suits all those passages where *coming* or *approaching* is spoken of: for while  reigns  or  administrations  approach  and  recede,  kingdoms have  attributes  and  boundaries  which  are  stationary.  Reign  and Kingdom  of  God,  though  sometimes  applicable  to  the  same subject, never contemplate it in the same light. They are, indeed, as intimately connected as the reign of king William and the kingdom of Great Britain. The former represents the administration of the kingdom, and the latter the state over which this administration extends.  

Two  good  reasons  may  be  offered  why  Matthew,  the  oldest Christian writer, generally prefers Kingdom or Reign of *Heaven,* to the  phrase  Kingdom  or  Reign  of  *God:*  I  say  *generally,*  for  he occasionally uses *both* designations.14 He wrote to Jews in Judea 

who expected a Messiah, a King, and a Kingdom of God on *earth,* a mere improvement of the Jewish system; and therefore to raise their conception he delights to call it the Reign or Kingdom of *Heaven*, in contrast with that earthly Kingdom of God, of which they were so long in possession. 

He also found a good reason in the idiom of the Jewish prophets for using the word *Heaven* (both in the singular and plural form) for *God.* Daniel told the Assyrian monarch that his kingdom would be sure to him when he would have learned that "the *Heavens* do rule;" yet in the preceding verse he says, "Till thou knowest that the Most High rules in the kingdom of man," — thus using *Heavens* and  *the  Most  High*  as  synonymous.  The  Psalmist  says,  "The wicked  set  their  mouths  against  the  *Heavens.*"  The  Prodigal confesses that he had "sinned against *Heaven,*" and Jesus himself asked  whether  the  baptism  of John  was  "from  *Heaven*  or  from men." Thus he was authorized from the Jewish use of the word to regard it as equivalent to *God.* If, then, Matthew had meant no more by the phrase "Kingdom of Heaven" and the "Kingdom of God," he was justified by the Jewish use of the word *heaven,* to apply it in that sense. Some may object to all these remarks upon Matthew's manner, that it was Jesus Christ and the preachers he commissioned  who  called  it  the  Kingdom  of  Heaven,  and  not Matthew  Levi.  To  such  we  reply  that  the  other  sacred  writers uniformly, in reciting all the same parables and incidents, use the phrase "Kingdom of God," and *never* the phrase "the Kingdom of Heaven." 

From the use of the phrase "Kingdom of God," we must, I think, regard him as having special reference to the reason first assigned. He does not say the Kingdom of *Heaven* shall be taken from the Jews; but  "The Kingdom  of God shall  be taken from  you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of it:" for although it might  with  propriety,  in  his  acceptation,  he  said  that  the  Jews already had the kingdom of God, it could not be said that they had the kingdom of *Heaven* as proclaimed by Matt. 15:1-39  

When  compared  with  the  earthly  Kingdom  of  God  among  the Jews, it is certainly the Kingdom of *Heaven;* for Jesus alleges that his kingdom is not of this world; and Daniel affirmed that in the days of the last worldly empire the God of heaven would set up a kingdom unlike all others then on earth; in which, as Paul teaches, men are "blessed with every spiritual blessing in heavenly places in Christ;"16 for he has raised us Jews and Gentiles, and "has set us down together in the heavenly places by Christ Jesus."17

There  is,  in  the  superior  and  heavenly  privileges  and  honors bestowed upon the citizens of this kingdom, the best reason why it should have first been presented to the world under this title, rather than  any  other;  and  for  the  same  reasons  which  influenced Matthew to usher it into notice in Judea, under this designation, we ought now to prefer it, because many of our contemporaries, like the ancient Jews, see as much of heaven and glory in the veiled grace of the Mosaic institution, as  in the unveiled grace of the Christian  kingdom.  The  pertinency  of  this  title  will  appear  still more evident as we develop the constitutional privileges of this kingdom. 

But  most  evidently  the  kingdom  of  heaven  is  "*the  Kingdom  of Christ and of God.*"18 It is the kingdom of God, because he set it 

up,19 gave the constitution and King, and all the materials out of which it is erected.20 It is the kingdom of Christ, because God the 

Father gave it to him as his Son, and as the *heir of all things,* and therefore, "all that is the Father's is mine," says Jesus, "and I am his."21 *God created all things* **by** *Jesus Christ and* **for** *him.* 

Having, then, noticed the reasons for the characteristic *titles* of this kingdom,  and having already ascertained what  are the elements absolutely essential to a kingdom, distinguished from those merely circumstantial or accidental, we shall now proceed to consider in the order suggested, the Constitution, King, Subjects, Laws, and Territory of the Kingdom of Heaven. 

***Constitution*** 

God himself, after the gracious counsels of his own will, proposed and tendered the constitution of this kingdom to his own Son. This "glory he had with the father before the world was." He that was "in  the  beginning  with  God" — "*the  wisdom  and  power  of God*" — was set up from everlasting, or ever the earth was. "Then was  I  with  God,  as  one  brought  up  with  him;  I  was  daily  his 

delight,  rejoicing  always  before  him — rejoicing  in  the  habitable parts of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men."22

Therefore, he who was to be "*ruler in Israel*" was with God in counsel "in the beginning of all his ways;" for "his goings forth were from of old, even from the day of eternity."23

It was **to do the will,** or fulfil the items of this constitution, that "*the* **word** was made flesh and dwelt among us." I came to *do the will* of him that *sent* me, and to finish "the work *given* me to do." "I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to resume it; this  commandment  I  received  from  my  Father."  The  Father "commissioned and sent him forth into the world." He "came down from heaven." "Thou hast given me power over all flesh, that I might give eternal life to all that thou hast given me." 

These,  and  many  other  passages,  which  the  reader  will  easily remember,  unequivocally  evince  that  an  understanding  and agreement existed ere time began between God and the **Word** of God — or,  as  now  revealed,  between  the  **Father**  and  the  **Son**, respecting the kingdom. In consequence of which, "the *Word* was made flesh and dwelt among us" — in consequence of which "he divested himself" of his antecedent glory — "took upon him the form of  a  bond-servant" — "was  made  in  the  likeness  of  sinful flesh" — "took part with us in flesh and blood." In consequence of which agreement, and the promised glory, for "the joy set before him in the promise," of "seeing his seed the travail of his soul, and being satisfied," he "endured the cross, despising the shame," and was "made perfect through sufferings to lead many sons to glory." 

To  the  stipulations  concerning  eternal  life,  propounded  in  the constitution  of  the  Kingdom  of  Heaven,  frequent  allusions  are made in the Apostle's writings. Thus the believers were "elected in *him*  before  the  foundation  of  the  world,"  and  "eternal  life  was promised  before  the  times  of  the  ages,"  "according  to  the benevolent  purposes  which  *he  purposed  in  himself*  for  the administration  of  the  fulness  of  the  appointed  times,  to  gather together all under Christ — all in the heavens and all on the earth, under him. He formerly marked us out for an adoption through 

Jesus Christ to himself, according to his purpose, who effectually works all things according to the counsel of his will.24

From all these sayings and allusions, we must trace the constitution of this kingdom into eternity — before time began. We must date it from *everlasting,* and resolve it into the absolute gracious will of the eternal God. In reference to all the prospective developments of time, "known to God from the beginning," it proposed to make the **word**  flesh,  and  then  to  make  the  Incarnate  Word,  called Emmanuel, of Jesus Christ, the *King,* to give him all who should be reconciled to God by him for *subjects,* to put under him all the angelic hosts, and constitute him monarch of earth, *lawgiver* to the universe; and thus make him heir and Lord of all things. 

As a constitution brings all the elements of a kingdom into a new relation to one another, so it is the measure and guarantee of all the privileges, immunities, and obligations accruing to all the parties in that relation. It prescribes, arranges, and secures all the privileges, duties, obligations, honors, and emoluments of the King and the subjects. Neither of them can claim more than it stipulates and guarantees, and neither of them can rightfully be deprived of any of them. 

From the premises now before us, and the light given to us in these scriptures and those in the margin, we learn —  

***First**.* That God is the author of the constitution of the Kingdom of Heaven; that he propounded it to the **word** that was made flesh, before  the  world  was,  in  prospect  of  all  the  developments  of creation. 

***Second.*** That the **word** accepted it, because the will of God was always his delight; therefore he said, "I come to do thy will, O God!"  Hence  "*God*  has so  loved the world as to  give his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but obtain eternal life." 

***Third.*** That in consequence "all *authority* in heaven and earth" was given to Jesus Christ, and all orders of intelligence subjected to 

him, that he might be *King* over all, and have the power of giving eternal life to his people.25

***Fourth**.*  That  the  earth  is  now  the  Lord's,  the  present  temporal territory of his kingdom; that the heathen people are given to him for  his  inheritance,  and  the  uttermost  parts  of  the  earth  for  his possession; that all ends of the earth are his, and all dominions, kindreds, tribes, tongues, and people shall yet serve him on earth and glorify him in heaven.26

***Fifth**.* That all that he redeems are his seed — his subjects: that he will have their faith, confidence, esteem, admiration, and gratitude forever; that he will be worshipped, honored, and revered by them in a world without end: that God, angels, and saints will delight in him for ever and ever.27 He has, therefore, to raise the dead, judge the  world,  and  to  present  the  redeemed  pure,  holy,  happy,  and triumphant before his Father, and then to give up his kingdom to God. 

To  comprehend  in  any  adequate  idea,  the  constitution  of  this kingdom, we must learn more than its history, or the way in which it  was  introduced  and  propounded.  We  must  regard  all  the elements of the kingdom as *constitutional* elements — the King as constitutional King; the subjects, laws, and territory, including the ultimate  inheritance,  as  constitutional  subjects,  laws,  territory, inheritance; and, therefore, we shall speak of them in detail. 

***The King*** 

The  Lord  Jesus  Christ  is  the  constitutional  monarch  of  the Kingdom of Heaven. The privileges guaranteed to him in reference to the kingdom are as follows: 

As King, he is to be the *oracle* of God — to have the disposal of the Holy  Spirit — to  be  Prophet  and  High  Priest  of  the  Temple  of God — to have the throne of his Father — to be governor of all nations on  earth,  and  head  of  all  hierarchs  and  powers  in  heaven — the supreme Lawgiver, the only Savior — the resurrection and the life, the ultimate and final Judge of all, and the Heir of all things. These honors, privileges, and powers, are secured to him by the irrevocable grant of the God and Father of all; therefore, as said Isaiah, "The Lord cometh with a strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him. Behold his reward is with him, and his work before him." "I have set my King upon my holy hill of Zion." "Ask of me, and  I  will  give  thee  the  heathen  for  thine  inheritance,  and  the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession." "I have made him a leader  and  commander  of  the  people" — "a  light  to  the Gentiles" — "salvation to the ends of the earth" — "a Priest forever after the order of Melchisedeck," "Sit thou at my right hand till I make thy foes thy footstool." "The government shall be upon his shoulders." "All things are delivered to me by my Father." "He is Lord of the dead and living." "Angels, authorities, and powers are subjected to him." "The Father gave the Spirit without measure to him." "He received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit." "The kingdom is the Lord's, and he is the governor among the nations." "He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth." "They shall fear thee as long as sun  and  moon  endure  to  all  generations."  "The  Father  has committed all judgments to the Son." 

But, not to weary the reader with quotations and proofs, we shall give but another: — "Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights. I have put my Spirit upon him. He shall bring  forth  judgment  unto  truth.  He  shall  not  fail  nor  be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth; and the Isles shall  wait  for  his  law." — "I,  the  Lord,  have  called  thee  in righteousness, and will hold thy hand and keep thee, and give thee for a *covenant* of the people, for a *light* to the Gentiles — to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house."28

***The Subjects of the Kingdom*** 

They  are  all  born  again.  Their  privileges  and  honors  are  the following: —  

***First**.* Their constitutional King is the only begotten Son of God; whose  titles  and  honors  are — Image  of  the  invisible God — Effulgence  of  the  Father's  glory — Emmanuel — Upholder  of the universe — Prophet of the Prophets — High Priest of the temple of God — King  of  kings — Lord  of  lords — the  only Potentate — Commander  and  Covenant  of  the  people — Captain  of Salvation — Counsellor, Lawgiver, Redeemer, Deliverer, Mediator, Savior, Advocate, Judge. He is the Sun of Righteousness, Prince of Peace,  Lamb  of God,  Lion  of the tribe of Judah, the Root  and Offspring  of  David,  the  Bright  and  Morning  Star,  Light  of  the World,  the  Faithful  and  True  Witness,  Bishop  of  Souls,  Great Shepherd of the Sheep, Head of the Church, Lord of all, Heir of the Universe, the Resurrection and the Life, the Son of Man, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the end, the Amen, etc. etc. Such is the  Christian's  King,  whose  assistance  in  all  these  characters, offices,  and  relations,  as  exhibited,  under  all  these  figures,  is guaranteed to him in the Constitution. Indeed it is all expressed in one promise — "*I will be your God, and you shall be my people.*" 

***Second**.* It is guaranteed that "their sins and iniquities are to be remembered no more." "There is no condemnation to them who are under Christ." "Sin shall have no dominion, nor lord it over them." The Lord imputeth to them no sin. They are all pardoned, justified, and saved from sin. 

***Third**.* They are adopted into the family of God; made sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty, children of God, and heirs — joint heirs with Christ. They have an Advocate in the heavens, through whom their persons and prayers are accepted. 

***Fourth**.* They all know the Lord. "All thy children shall be taught of God." The Holy Spirit of God writes the law of God upon their hearts, and inscribes it upon their understanding: so that they need not teach every one his fellow citizen to know the Lord, "for they all know him from the least to the greatest." They are sanctified through the truth — separated and consecrated to God. 

***Fifth**.* They have the promise of a resurrection from the dead, and eternal  life;  an  inheritance  incorruptible,  undefiled,  and unfading — new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness alone shall dwell forever. 

Such are the constitutional rights and privileges of the citizens of the  Kingdom  of  Heaven.  All  these  have  obtained  for  them  the following titles and honors: — Kingdom of Heaven; Israel of God; chosen generation; body of Christ; children of God; habitation of God; family of God; Jerusalem from above; Mount Zion; peculiar people; the elect of God; holy nation; temple of the Holy Spirit; house of God; city of the living God; pillar and ground of the truth; living stones; seed of Abraham; citizens of heaven; lights of the world; salt of the earth; heirs of God; joint heirs with Christ, etc. 

The privileges, honors, and emoluments belong to every citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven. Indeed, they are all comprehended in the summary  which  Paul  (from  Jeremiah)  lays  before  the  believing Hebrews: — "This  is  the  constitution  which  I  will  make  with  the house of Israel for those days: I will put my laws into their mind, and inscribe them upon their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. And they shall not teach every man his fellow citizen, and every man his brother, saying, Know the  Lord; for all shall  know me, from  the least  of them to  the greatest  of  them;  because  I  will  be  merciful  to  their unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more."29 To this summary the reader may add those scriptures in the margin, as confirmatory of the above.30

***The Laws of the Kingdom*** 

The supreme law of the kingdom is *love* — love to the King and love to each other. From this law all its religious homage and morality flow. Precepts and examples innumerable present this to the mind of all the citizens. The Kingdom of Heaven is divided into small societies, called *churches,* or *congregations of the Lord.* Each of these communities in the reception of members, in the education and discipline of them, or in excluding them when necessary, is to be governed by the apostolic instructions: for to the Apostles the Savior committed the management of his kingdom. After they had made citizens by preaching the gospel and baptizing, they were commanded to teach them to observe whatsoever the Savior had commanded them. 

These laws and usages of the Apostles must be learned from what the  Apostles  published  to  the  world,  after  the  ascension  and coronation of the King, as they are recorded in the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles: for we shall see in the sequel that the gospel was fully developed, and the whole doctrine of the Reign of Christ *began* to be proclaimed in Jerusalem, on the first Pentecost after the ascension. 

The old or Jewish constitution was promulged first on Sinai on the first  Pentecost  after  the  redemption  of  Israel  from  Egyptian bondage; and from that day, and what is written after it in Exodus and Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, all the laws, manners, and  customs  authorized  by  the  national  constitution  are  to  be found.  They  are  not  to  be  sought  after  in  Genesis,  nor  in  the antecedent  economy.  Neither  are  the  statutes  and  laws  of  the Christian kingdom to be sought for in the Jewish scriptures, nor antecedent  to  the  day  of  Pentecost;  except  so  far  as  our  Lord himself, during his life time, propounded the doctrine of his reign. But of this when we ascertain the *commencement* of this kingdom. 

There is one universal law of naturalization, or for making citizens out of all nations, enjoined upon those citizens of the kingdom who are  engaged  in  the  work  of  proselytism;  but  the  laws  of  this kingdom, like the laws of every other kingdom, are obligatory only on the citizens. 

The weekly celebration of the death and resurrection of Jesus, and the weekly meeting of the disciples of Christ for this purpose, and for the edification of one another in their most holy faith, are the only positive statutes of the kingdom; and, therefore, there is no law, statute, or observance in this kingdom, that in the least retards its extension from East to West, from North to South, or that can prevent its progress in all nations of the world. 

It  is,  however,  worthy  of  observation,  that  every  part  of  the Christian  worship,  in  the  small  communities  spread  over  the territory of the Kingdom of Heaven, like so many candlesticks in a large edifice, are designed to enlighten and convert the world; and, therefore, in all the meetings of the family of God, they are to keep this supremely in view; and to regard themselves as the "pillar and ground of the truth." 

Concerning the details of the laws of the kingdom, we cannot now speak  particularly.  "The  favor  of  God  which  brings  salvation, teaches all the citizens of heaven, that, denying all ungodliness and worldly lusts, they should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this  present  world,  expecting  the  blessed  hope — namely,  the appearing of the glory of the great God, and of our Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."  These  things  the  Bishops  of  every  community  should teach and enforce; for such is the spirit, and such is the object of all the laws and statutes of the Kingdom of Heaven. 

***The Territory of the Kingdom*** 

In all other kingdoms, except the Kingdom of Heaven, the territory is  the  national  domain  and  inheritance.  It  was  so  in  the  first Kingdom  of  God  under  the  constitution  from  Sinai.  But  in  the typical kingdom they lived at a distance from their inheritance for one generation. During these forty  years, in which they pitched their tents in the wilderness, *God was their inheritance.* He rained bread from heaven upon them, and sent them flesh upon the east wind. He made the flinty rock Horeb a living spring, whose stream followed them all the way to Jordan. He renewed their garments every day, so that for forty years they grew not old, not needed a single patch. A pillar of fire by night and a cloud by day guided them towards Canaan, the land of their inheritance. 

The whole earth is the present territory of the Kingdom of Heaven, but the new heavens and earth are to be its *inheritance.* The earth, indeed, is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; but the children of God and the children of the wicked one — the *wheat* and the *darnel,* are both planted in it, and must grow till the harvest. The righteous have their bread and water guaranteed to them while they live; for "godliness is profitable to all things, having *promise of the life that now is,* as well as of that which is to come." But the joint heirs of Christ  are  never  taught  to  regard  the  earth  as  their  inheritance. They may indeed, say, though poor and penniless, "All things are ours; whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come — all are ours, and we are Christ's, and Christ is God's." But, like the Jews on their journey to Canaan,  "they  seek  a  better  country" — "they  seek  a  city  yet  to come." "My kingdom," says Jesus, "is not of this world." And, therefore, in the world, Christians are strangers and pilgrims, and may expect tribulation. 

There earth is the present *theatre of war;* therefore all Christians in the territory are *soldiers.* Their expenses, their rations are allowed, the  arms  and  munitions  of  war  are  supplied  them  from  the magazines  in  Mount  Zion,  the  strong  hold  and  fortress  of  the kingdom; where the King, the heads of departments, and all the legions of angels are resident. So that on entering the Army of the Faith every soldier is panoplied with the armor of God; and when inducted into the heavenly tactics under the Captain of Salvation, he is expected to be a good soldier of Jesus Christ, and to fight the good fight of faith courageously and victoriously. 

The Kingdom of Heaven on this territory is greatly opposed by the kingdom of Satan, which ever seeks to make an *inheritance* out of the  territory  of  the  militant  kingdom  of  righteousness;  and therefore, the citizens have not to wrestle with flesh and blood, but with  the  rulers  of  the  darkness  of  this  world — with  spiritual wickedness in high places. 

Ever since the commencement of this kingdom, the governments of this world have either been directly opposed to it, or at best, pretended friends; and therefore their influence has always been opposed to the true Spirit and genius of the Christian institution. Christians  have  nothing  to  expect  from  them  except  liberty  of conscience and protection from violence, while leading peaceable and  quiet  lives,  in  all  godliness  and  honesty,  till  Jesus  take  to himself his great power, and hurl all these potentates from their thrones and make his cause triumphant — a consummation devoutly to be wished, and which cannot now be regarded as far distant. 

***Manner and Customs of the Kingdom*** 

Touching *the manners and customs* of the Kingdom of Heaven, they are such as generally obtained in the land of Judea and in the East  at  the  time  of  its  erection:  or,  rather,  they  are  the  simple manners  and  customs  of  the  *family  worship  age*  of  the  world. These are consecrated by simply performing them with a regard to Jesus Christ, or from the motives prompted by the doctrine of the Reign of Heaven. As we treat our natural brothers and sisters in public  and  in  private — as  we  address,  salute,  and  converse  with them — as we transact all family business, and conduct the affairs of the household — so are Christians to treat one another. There is no other  virtue  or  utility  in  these,  than  as  they  cherish  brotherly kindness and love, and are regarded to the Lord. 

***Induction into the Kingdom of Heaven*** 

Into  every  kingdom,  human  or  divine,  there  is  a  legal  door  of admission. That is, in the statute book of Heaven, called a *birth.* Into  the  kingdom  of  nature  we  are  born.  Into  the  future  and ultimate kingdom of glory we enter, soul and body, by being born from the grave. As Christ, the first born from the dead, entered the heavenly  kingdom,  so  must  all  his  brethren.  And  as  to  this kingdom of which we speak, as now existing in this world, Jesus himself taught that into it no person can legally enter who is not born again, or "*born of water and the Spirit.*"31 The analogy is 

complete between the kingdoms of nature — of grace — and of glory. Hence we have natural birth, metaphorical or spiritual birth, and supernatural birth. There is a being born of the flesh — born of the Spirit — born of the grave; and there is a kingdom for the flesh — a kingdom for the Spirit — and a kingdom for the glorified man. 

This second, or new birth, which inducts into the Kingdom of God, is always subsequent to a death and burial, as it will be into the everlasting kingdom of glory. It is indeed, a literal death and burial before a literal resurrection, into the heavenly and eternal kingdom. It is also a metaphorical or figurative death and burial, before the figurative resurrection or new birth into the Kingdom of Heaven. Water  is  the  element  in  which  this  burial  and  resurrection  are performed, according to the constitutional laws of the Kingdom of Heaven.  Hence  Jesus  connects  the  water  and  the  Spirit  when speaking of entering the Kingdom of God. 

In  naturalizing  aliens,  the  commandment  of  the  King  is first — submit to them the Constitution, or preach to them *the gospel of the kingdom,* Soon as they understand and believe this, and are desirous of being translated into the Kingdom  of Christ and of God, that "they many receive the remission of sins and inheritance among all that are sanctified," they are to be buried in water into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and raised out of it confessing their death to sin, their faith in Christ's sacrifice and resurrection: and thus they are born of water and the Spirit, and constituted citizens of the kingdom of heaven. *To as many as thus receive him he gives privilege to become the children of God;* for they are "*born of God*" — born of *God,* when born of water and the Spirit, because this is the institution of God. 

In these days of apostasy men have sought out many inventions. Some have attempted to get into the Kingdom of Heaven without being  born  at  all.  Others  imagine  that  they  can  be  born  of  the Spirit, without water, and that the king is well pleased with them who have been born without a mother, as those who are lawfully born  of  father  and  mother.  Others  think  that  neither  Spirit  nor water is necessary; but if they are politically born of the flesh, they can  enter  the  kingdom  as  rightfully  as  the  Jewish  circumcised infants enter the earthly kingdom of Israel. But as we have no faith in any modern improvements of the gospel, change or amendment of the constitution of the Kingdom of Heaven, we must leave them to account to the King himself, who "*have transgressed the law, changed the ordinance, and broken the everlasting covenant;*"32 and proceed to the question, “When did the Kingdom of Heaven commence?” (See next essay) 

4. The Coming of the Kingdom 

When did the Kingdom of Heaven commence? "With the ministry of John," says  one:  "With the ministry of Jesus," says  another: "With the first sending out of the Twelve Apostles," says a third: "At the resurrection of Jesus," says a fourth: "At none of them; but by degrees from the baptism of John till the fall of Jerusalem," says a fifth. 

The  reader  will  please  remember  that  there  are  at  least  *five elements* essential to a perfectly organized kingdom, and that it may  be  contemplated  in  reference  to  one  or  more  of  these component parts. Hence the numerous and various parables of the Savior. Sometimes he speaks of the administration of its affairs — of its  principles  in  the  heart — of  its  subjects — of  its  King — of  its territory — of its progress — of various incidents in its history. Hence the parable of the sower — of wheat and darnel — of the leaven — of the merchant seeking goodly pearls — of the grain of mustard seed — of the  sweep  net — of  the  marriage  of  a  king's  son — of  a  nobleman going into a far country — of the ten virgins — of the talents — of the sheep and goats, present to our view the Kingdom of Heaven in different  attitudes,  either  in  its  elements  or  in  its  history — its commencement or its close. 

The  approaching  or  the  coming  of  the  Reign  of  Heaven,  can properly  have  respect  only  to  one  or  two  of  the  elements  of  a kingdom; or to the formal exhibition of that whole organization of society which we call *a kingdom.* It can have no proper allusion to its  territory;  for  that  was  created  and  located  before  man  was created. It cannot allude either to the persons who were constituted subjects,  for  they  too  were  in  existence  before  the  kingdom commenced. It cannot allude to the birth or baptism of the King, for  it  was  not  till  after  these  that  Jesus  *began*  to  proclaim  its coming or approach. It cannot have reference to the ministry of John  or  of  Jesus,  any  more  than  to  the  patriarchal  or  Jewish dispensations; because Jesus did not begin to proclaim the coming of this reign *till after John was cast into prison.* This is a fact of so much importance, that Matthew, Mark, and  Luke distinctly and substantially  declare,  that,  in  conformity  to  ancient  predictions, Jesus was to  begin  to  proclaim  in  *Galilee,* and  *that he did  not commence to proclaim the doctrine or the gospel of the coming of the Reign, till after John's ministry ceased and he was cast into prison.* In this assertion the Evangelists agree: "Now Jesus hearing that  John  was  imprisoned,  retired  into  Galilee;  and  having  left Nazareth, resided at Capernaum. For thus saith the Prophet," etc. From that time Jesus *began* to proclaim, saying, "Reform for the Reign of Heaven approaches;" or, "The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand," as says the common version.33

Some  Baptists,  for  the  sake  of  *immersion,*  and  some  of  our brethren  in  the  Reformation,  for  the  sake  of  *immersion  for  the remission of sins,* seem desirous to have John in the Kingdom of Heaven,  and  to  date  the  commencement  of  the  Christian dispensation with the first appearance of John the Immerser. They allege in support of this hypothesis that Jesus said, "The Law and the Prophets continued till John," (the only instructors of men;) "since that time the Kingdom of God is preached, and every man presses into it." "Publicans and harlots show you the way into the Kingdom of Heaven," said Jesus to the Pharisees. Again, "Alas! for  you  Scribes  and  Pharisees!  for  you  shut  the  Kingdom  of Heaven against men, and will neither enter yourselves, nor permit others that would to enter." "The Kingdom of God is within you." "The  Kingdom  of  Heaven  has  overtaken  you."  From  these premises they infer that the Kingdom of Heaven was actually set up  by  John  the  Baptist:  "For,"  say  they,  "how  could  men  and women *enter into a kingdom* which was not set up? And did not John  immerse  for  the  remission  of  sins,  and  call  upon  men  to repent and reform in order to baptism?" 

The  Paidobaptists,  too,  will  have  Abraham,  Isaac,  and  Jacob, Moses, David, and all the circumcised Jews in the Kingdom of Heaven,  because  Jesus  said,  "Before  Abraham  was,  I  am;" "Abraham  saw  my  day  and  was  glad;"  and  Paul  says  Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt, and forsook Egypt in faith of the Christian recompense of reward. Yes, and Paul affirms that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their families, who dwelt in tents in the promised land, looked not only to the rest in Canaan, but they sought a heavenly country, and expected the city of foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Thus  the  Jews  had  Christ  in  the  manna  and  in  the  rock,  and baptism in the cloud and in the sea. 

The  mistake  is  specifically  the  same.  Christ  was  promised  and prefigured  before  he  came,  and  the  Kingdom  of  Heaven  was promised and preached  by John, by Jesus,  the Twelve, and the Seventy,  (who  went  about  proclaiming  the  glad  tidings  of  the Reign),  before  the  Reign  of  Christ,  or  Kingdom  of  Heaven commenced. Because Christ was promised and prefigured in the patriarchal  and  Jewish  ages,  the  Paidobaptists  will  have  the Kingdom of Heaven on earth since the days of Abel; and because the  glad  tidings  of  the  Reign  and  Kingdom  of  Heaven  and  the principles  of  the  new  and  heavenly  order  of  society  were promulged by John, the Baptists will have John the Baptist in the Kingdom of Heaven, and the very person who set it up. 

Let us, then, examine this matter with all candor: and first, we shall place  the  passages  above  quoted  out  of  the  testimonies  of  the Evangelists on one side, and the following passages on the other side; and then see if we can reconcile them. John says, "Reform, for the Reign of God approaches." Jesus began to proclaim, saying "Reform, for the Reign or Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." He also commanded the Twelve and the Seventy to peregrinate all Judea, making  the  same  proclamation.34  Of  John  the  Baptist  he  said, 

though greater than all the Prophets, "The least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he." 

Thus,  after  John  was  beheaded,  we  have  some  eighty-four preachers  daily  proclaiming  the  nigh  approach  of  the  Reign  of God; and Jesus often assuring his disciples that the Kingdom of God was soon to appear, and that some of his companions would see  him  enter  upon  his  Reign  before  they  died — and  yet  the Kingdom was set up by John! Scribes and Pharisees were shutting the kingdom against men, when Jesus had only given the keys to Peter! John the Baptist was in the kingdom, and the least in the kingdom  is  greater  than  he!  More  than  eighty  preachers  say, "Reform, for the Reign of Heaven is at hand;" and John the Baptist before he died, introduced all Judea and Jerusalem into it! How, then, shall we reconcile these apparent contradictions? Make both sides figurative, and it may be done. Regard both sides literally, and it cannot be done! To say that the kingdom came in one point of view at one time, and in another point of view at another time, is only  to  say  that  it  came  in  different  senses — literally  and figuratively. For our part, we must believe that the Kingdom of Heaven  began,  or  the  Reign  of  Heaven  literally  and  truly commenced in one day. 

Many of its principles were developed by the ancient Prophets; David,  Isaiah,  and  others  wrote  much  concerning  it;  John  the Baptist  proclaimed  its  immediate  and  near  approach,  and  more fully developed its spiritual design; therefore he was superior to them.  Jesus  often  unfolded  its  character  and  design  in  various similitudes;  and  every  one  who  understood  and  received  these *principles* was said to "press into the kingdom," or to have "the kingdom  within  them;"  and  wherever  these  principles  were promulged, "the Kingdom of Heaven" was said to "come nigh" to the people, or to have "overtaken them;" and those who opposed these principles and interposed their authority, to prevent others from receiving them, were said to "shut the Kingdom of Heaven against men;" and thus all these scriptures must of necessity be understood  from  the  contexts  in  which  they  stand:  for  it  is impossible that the Reign of Heaven could literally commence "*till Jesus was glorified,*" "received the promise of the Holy Spirit," was "made Lord and Christ," and "sat down with his Father upon the throne" — for he left the earth *to receive a kingdom.*35

To make this, if possible, still more evident, we ask *When did the Kingdom  of  God,  established  by  Moses  amongst  the  seed  of Abraham, cease?* This question penetrates the whole nature and necessity of the case: for will any one suppose that there were two Kingdoms of God on earth at one and the same time? Certainly the one ceased before the other began. 

Now,  that  the  kingdom  of  God,  ministered  by  Moses,  had  not ceased during the personal ministry of the Messiah on earth, is, we think, abundantly evident from the following facts and documents: 

***First.*** Jesus was to have appeared, and did appear, "*in the end of the  world,*"  or  last  days  of  the  first  Kingdom  of  God.  "In  the conclusion  of  the  age  has  he  appeared  to  put  away  sin  by  the sacrifice of himself." The "world to come" was one the names of the gospel age. He has not subjected "the world to come" to angels, as he did the world past, says Paul to the Hebrews. He appeared, then, not in the beginning of the gospel age, but in the end of the Jewish age. 

***Second**.* The Temple was the house of God to the very close of the life of Jesus. For it was not till the Jewish ministry conspired to kill him  that  he  deserted  it.  At  the  last  festival  of  his  life,  and immediately before he fell into their hands, on walking out of the Temple, he said, "Behold your house is deserted, for you shall not see me henceforth till you shall say, Blessed be he that comes in the name of the Lord!" It was his Father's house, the house of God, till that moment. Then, indeed, the glory departed. 

***Third**.* The Jewish offerings and service, as a divine institution, continued  till  the  condemnation  of  Jesus.  He  sent  the  cleansed leper to the priest to make the offering commanded in the law. He commanded the people to hear the doctors of the law who sat in Moses' chair. He paid the didrachma. He was a minister of the circumcision. He lived *under,* not *after* the law. He kept all its ordinances, and caused all his disciples to regard it in its primitive import and authority to the last passover. *Indeed, it could not be disannulled, for it was not consummated till on the cross he said,* "**it is finished**." 

***Fourth**.* When he visited Jerusalem the last time, and in the last parable  pronounced  to  them,  he  told  them  plainly  that  "the Kingdom of God should be taken from them" and given to a nation who  should  make  a  better  use  of  the  honors  of  the  kingdom; consequently at the time the Jews had the Kingdom of God. ***Fifth**.* It was not until his death that the veil of the Temple was rent; that the things "which could be shaken were shaken." It was then, and not till then, that he nailed the legal institution to the cross. Then, and not  till  then, was  the middle  wall of partition broken down. The last Sabbath he slept in the grave.  *From the moment of his death there was no life in the old Kingdom of God.* The Temple was deserted, its veil rent, its foundation shaken, the city  devoted,  the  ritual  abolished,  and  as  after  death  the judgment — the Temple, city, and nation waited for the day of his vengeance. 

The Kingdom of God was evidently in the Jewish institution till Jesus died. Hence the Kingdom of Heaven came not while Jesus lived. In anticipation, they who believed the gospel of the kingdom received the Kingdom of God, just as in anticipation he said, "I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do" before he began to suffer; and as he said, "This cup is the new testament in my blood, shed for the remission of the sins of many," before it was shed. So while the doctrines of this reign — faith, repentance, baptism,  and  a  new  principle  of  sonship  to  Abraham  were promulging by John, the Twelve, the Seventy, and by Himself, the Kingdom  of  Heaven  was  approaching;  and  those  who  received these  principles  by  anticipation  were  said  to  enter  into  the kingdom, or to have the kingdom within them. 

The principles of any reign or revolution are always promulged, debated, and canvassed before a new order of things is set up. A party is formed upon these principles before strength is acquired, or a leader obtained competent to the commencement of a new order of things. In society, as in nature, we have first the blade, next the stem, and then the ripe corn in the ear. We call it wheat, or we call it corn, when we have only the promise in the blade. By such a figure of speech, the Kingdom of God was spoken of, while as yet only its principles were promulging. 

When these American states were colonial subjects of the king of England, and long before the setting up of a republic, republican doctrines  were  promulged  and  debated.  The  believers  and advocates of these doctrines were called republicans, while as yet there  was  not  a  republic  on  this  continent.  He  who  dates  the commencement of the Kingdom of Heaven from the ministry of John the Baptist sympathizes with him who dates the American republics from the first promulgation of the republican principles, or from the formation of a republican party in the British colonies. But as a faithful and intelligent historian, in writing the history of the American republics, commences with the history of the first promulgation  of  these  principles,  and  records  the  sayings  and deeds of the first promulgers of the new doctrines; so the sacred historians began their history of the Kingdom of Heaven with the appearance  of  John  in  the  wilderness  of  Judea,  preaching  the Messiah, faith, repentance, a holy life, and *raising up a new race of Israelites on the principle of faith rather than of flesh;* for this in truth was the "blade" of the Kingdom of Heaven. 

Having from all these considerations seen that until the death of the Messiah his kingdom *could not* commence; and having seen from  the  record  itself  that  it  *did  not*  commence  before  his resurrection,  we  proceed  to  the  development  of  things  after  his resurrection, to ascertain the day on which this kingdom was set up, or the Reign of Heaven began. 

The  writer  to  whom  we  are  most  indebted  for  an  orderly  and continued narrative of the affairs of the Kingdom of Heaven is the Evangelist Luke. His history begins with the angelic annunciations of the nativity of John and Jesus, and ends with the appearance of the great standard-bearer of the Cross in Imperial Rome, A. D. 64. That part of the history to which we now look as a guide, to the affairs of the commencement of the Reign, is the notices which he makes of the *forty days* which the Lord spent in his crucified body, previous to his ascension. The reader ought not to be told (for he ought to know) that Jesus rose in the same body in which he was crucified, and in the reanimated fleshly body did eat, drink, and converse with his Apostles and friends for forty days. That body was not changed till, like the living saints who shall be on the earth at his second personal coming, it was made spiritual, incorruptible and glorious at the instant of his ascension. So that the man Christ Jesus  was  make  like  to  all  his  brethren  in  his  death,  burial, resurrection,  transfiguration,  ascension,  and  glorification;  or, rather, they shall be made to resemble him in all these respects. 

The  Apostles  testify  that  they  saw  him  ascend — that  a  cloud received him out of their sight — that angels descended to inform them that he was taken up into heaven, not to return for a long time — that he ascended far above the visible heavens, and now fills all things. Stephen, when dying, saw him standing on the right hand of God. 

Much attention is due to all the incidents of these forty days — as much at least, as to the forty days spent by Moses in the Mount with God in the affairs of the preceding Kingdom of God. For the risen Messiah makes the affairs of his approaching kingdom the principal topic of these forty days.36 Towards the close of these days,  and  immediately  before  his  ascension,  he  gave  the commission  to  his  Apostles  concerning  the  setting  up  of  this kingdom. "All authority in heaven and in earth is given to me: go, *therefore,*" said he, "convert the nations," "immersing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe *all the things* which I have commanded you; and, behold! I am with you always, even to the conclusion of this state."37 "But continue in the city of Jerusalem until you be invested with power from on high." Thus according to his promise and the ancient prophecy, it was to "begin at Jerusalem."38

The  risen  Savior  thus  directs  our  attention  to  Jerusalem  as  the *place,* and to a period distant "not many days" as the *time,* of the beginning of his reign. The great facts of the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus, not being yet fully developed to his Apostles, they were not qualified to take any steps to the setting up of a kingdom  which was  to  be  *founded upon Christ  crucified.*  They needed an interpreter of these facts, and a supernatural advocate of the pretensions of the King, before they could lay the foundation of his kingdom.  

Again,  the  King  himself  must  be  glorified  before  his  authority could be established on earth; for till he received the promise of the Spirit from his Father, and was placed on his throne, the Apostles could  not  receive  it;  so  that  Christ's  ascension  to  heaven,  and coronation were indispensable to the commencement of this Reign of Heaven. 

Here let us pause for a moment — leave the earth, and on the wings of  faith  in  the  testimony  of  Prophets  and  Apostles,  the  two witnesses for Jesus, let us follow him to heaven and ascertain his reception into the heaven of heavens, and exaltation to the right hand of God. 

***The Ascension of the Messiah*** 

Prophets and Apostles must now be heard. David, by the Spirit, says, "The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels; the Lord is among them as in Sinai in the holy place. Thou hast ascended on high; thou hast led captivity captive; thou has received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them."39 The same Prophet in speaking of the solemn and joyful procession at the carrying up of the ark of the ancient constitution to Mount Zion, turns his eye from the type to the antitype, and thus describes the entrance of the Messiah into Heaven: — "Who shall ascend into the hill of God?" The attendant angels  in  the  train  of  the  Messiah,  approaching  the  heaven  of heavens, shout, "Lift up your heads, O you gates! be lift up, you everlasting doors, and the King of  glory shall  come in." Those within, filled with astonishment that any one should so confidently demand admission into those gates so long barred against the sons of men, responsive shout, "Who is the King of glory?" The angels in attendance upon the Messiah reply in strains as triumphant, "The Lord,  strong  and  mighty!  the  Lord,  mighty  in  battle!"  and  still more  exultingly  triumphant,  shout,  "Lift  up  your  heads,  O  you gates! even lift them up, you everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is the King of glory? He is the Lord of hosts! he is the King of glory!"40

***Coronation of the Messiah*** 

Every thing in its proper place. He that ascended first descended. Jesus died, was buried, raised from the dead, ascended, and was crowned Lord of all. In the presence of all the heavenly hierarchs, the  four  living  creatures,  the  twenty-four  seniors,  and  ten thousands times ten thousand angels, he presents himself before the throne. So soon as the First Born from the dead appears in the palace  royal  of  the  universe,  his  Father  and  his  God,  in  his inaugural address, when anointing him Lord of all, says, "Let all the angels of God worship him" — "Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool." "Jehovah shall send out of Zion the rod of thy strength: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies, "Thy people, willing in the day of thy power, shall come to thee. In the beauty of holiness, more than the womb of the morning, shalt thou have the dew of thy progeny. The Lord hath sworn, and will not  repent.  Thou  art  a  Priest  forever  after  the  order  of Melchisedeck.  The  Lord  at  thy  right  hand  shall  strike  through kings  in  the  day  of  his  wrath."  "Thy  throne,  O  God,  endures forever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a sceptre of rectitude. Thou hast  loved  righteousness  and  hated  iniquity;  therefore  God,  thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of joy above thy fellows. Thou Lord in the beginning hast laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens  are  the  works  of  thy  hand:  they  shall  perish,  but  thou remainest; and they shall all grow old as does a garment, and as a vesture, shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail."41

Thus God highly exalted him, and did set him over all the works of his hands, and gave him a name and an honor above every name in heaven and on earth, that at the name of Jesus glorified every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess, to the glory of God. 

"Now we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, that he might taste death for all, on account of the sufferings of death, crowned with glory and honor" — Now "angels, authorities, principalities, and powers are subjected to him." "His enemies will I clothe with shame, but upon himself shall his crown flourish." 

The Holy Spirit sent down by Jesus from heaven, on the Pentecost after his resurrection, to the disciples in attendance in Jerusalem, informs  the  Apostles  of  all  that  had  been  transacted  in  heaven during the week after his ascension, and till that day. Peter now filled with that promised Spirit, informs the immense concourse assembled on the great day of Pentecost, that God had made that Jesus whom they had crucified both Lord and Christ — exalted him a **Prince** and a Savior to grant repentance to Israel and remission of sins. 

The first act of his reign was the bestowment of the Holy Spirit, according to the Prophecy of Joel and his own promise. So soon as he received the kingdom from God his Father, he poured out the blessings of his favor upon his friends; he fulfilled all his promises to the Apostles, and *forgave three thousand of his fiercest enemies.* He received pardons and gifts for them that did rebel, and shed forth abundantly all spiritual gifts on the little flock to whom it pleased  the  Father  to  give  the  kingdom.  Thus  commenced  the Reign of Heaven, on the day of Pentecost, in the person of the Messiah,  the  Son  of  God,  and  the  anointed  Monarch  of  the universe.  Under  him  his  people,  saved  from  their  sins,  have received a kingdom which cannot be shaken nor removed. 

But  as  the  erection  of  the  Jewish  tabernacle,  after  the commencement  of  the  first  Kingdom  of  God,  was  the  work  of some time, and of united and combined effort, on the part of those raised up and qualified for the work; so was the complete erection of the new temple of God. The Apostles, as wise master builders, laid  the  foundation — promulged  the  constitution,  laws,  and institutions of the King, and raised the standard of the kingdom in many  towns,  cities,  and  countries,  for  the  space  of  forty  years. Some of them not only saw "the Son of Man enter upon his reign," and the Kingdom of God commence on Pentecost, and carry his conquests over Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost parts of the earth; but they saw the Lord "come with power" and awful glory, and accomplish all his predictions on the deserted and devoted temple, city  and  people.  Thus  they  saw  a  bright  display  of  the  golden sceptre of his grace in forgiving those who bowed to his authority, and an appalling exhibition of the iron rod of his wrath in taking vengeance on his enemies who would not have him to reign over them. 

***Present Administration of the Kingdom of Heaven*** 

During the personal absence of the King, he has committed the management  of  this  kingdom  to  stewards.  These  were  first Apostles; next to them, Prophets; next, teachers; then, assistants, or helpers;  then  directors  or  presidents,  all  furnished  with  gifts, knowledge,  and  character,  suited  to  their  respective  functions. Besides these, many persons possessed of miraculous powers — gifts of  healing  and  speaking  foreign  languages,  were  employed  in setting up  and putting  in order the  communities composing  the Kingdom  of  Heaven.  Angels  also  were  employed,  and  are  still employed, under the great King in administering to them who are heirs of salvation. For Jesus now, as Lord of all, has the Holy Spirit at his disposal, and all the angels of God; and these are employed by him in the affairs of the kingdom.42

The  Apostles  were  plenipotentiaries  and  ambassadors  for  Jesus, and  had  all  authority  delegated  to  them  from  the  King.  Hence every thing was first taught and enjoined by them. They were the first preachers, teachers, pastors, overseers, and ministers in the kingdom, and had the direction and management of all its affairs.43

The communities collected and set in order by the Apostles were called the *congregation of Christ,* and all these taken together are sometimes called *the Kingdom of God.* But the phrases "church of God," or "congregation of Christ," and the phrases "Kingdom of Heaven"  or  "Kingdom  of  God,"  do  not  always  nor  exactly represent the same thing. The elements of the Kingdom of Heaven, it will be remembered, are not simply its subjects, and therefore not simply the congregations of disciples of Christ. But as these communities possess the oracles of God, are under the laws and institutions of the King, and therefore enjoy the blessings of the present salvation, they are in the records of the Kingdom, regarded as the only constitutional citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven; and to them exclusively belongs *all the present salvation.* Their King is now in heaven, but present with them by his Spirit in their hearts and in all the institutions of his kingdom. 

Every immersed believer, of good behavior, is, by the constitution, a free and full citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven, and entitled to all the social privileges and honors of that kingdom. Such of these as meet together statedly in one place in obedience to the King, or his ambassadors the Apostles, for the observance of all the institutions of the King, compose a family, or house, or congregation of Christ; and all these families or congregations, thus organized, constitute the  present  Kingdom  of  God  in  this  world.  So  far  the  phrases *Kingdom of Heaven* and *the congregation* or *body of Christ* are equivalent in signification.44

Now in gathering these communities, and in setting them in order, the Apostles had, when alive, and when dead, by their writings still have, the sole right of legislating, ordering, and disposing of all things.  But  it  is  not  the  will  of  Jesus  Christ,  because  it  is  not adapted to human nature, nor to the present state of his kingdom as administered in his absence, that the church should be governed by a *written* document alone. Hence in every city, town, and country where the Apostles gathered a community by their own personal labors, or by their assistants,  in  setting them in order, for their edification, and for their usefulness and influence in this world, they uniformly appointed elders, or overseers to labor in the word and  teaching,  and  to  preside  over  the  whole  affairs  of  the community. To these also were added *deacons,* or public *ministers* of  the  congregation,  who,  under  the  direction  of  the  overseers, were to manage all the affairs of these individual families of God. This  the  very  names  *Bishop*  and  *Deacon,*  and  all  qualifications enjoyed, fairly and fully import. 

But as all the citizens of the kingdom are free men under Christ they all have a voice in the selection of the persons whom the Apostles  appoint  to  the  offices.  The  Apostles  still  appoint  all persons so elected, possessing the qualifications which they *by the Holy Spirit* prescribed. *And if a congregation will not elect to these offices  the  persons  possessing  these  qualifications;  or  if  by  a waywardness and selfishness of their own, they should elect those unqualified,  and  thus  disparage  those  marked  out  by  the possession of those gifts; in either case, they despise the authority of the* *Ambassadors of Christ and must suffer for it.* It is, indeed, the Holy Spirit, and not the congregations, which creates Bishops and Deacons. The Spirit gives the qualifications, both natural and acquired; and, speaking to the congregations in the written oracles, commands their ordination or appointment to the work.45

In the present administration of the Kingdom of God, *faith is the* **principle**, *and ordinances the* **means** *of all spiritual enjoyment.* Without faith in the testimony of God, a person is without God, without  Christ,  and  without  hope  in  the  world.  A  Christless universe, as respects spiritual life and joy, is the most perfect blank which fancy can create. Without faith, nothing in the Bible can be enjoyed; and without it, there is to man no Kingdom of Heaven in all the dominions of God. 

In the kingdom of nature *sense* is the *principle,* and *ordinances* the *means,*  of  enjoyment.  Without  sense,  or  sensation,  nothing  in nature can be known or enjoyed. All the creative, recuperative, and renovating  power,  wisdom,  and  goodness  of  God,  exhibited  in nature, are contained in ordinances. The sun, moon, and stars — the clouds, the air, the water, the seasons, day and night, are therefore denominated  the  *ordinances*  of  heaven,  because  God's  power, wisdom, and goodness are *in* them, and felt by us only *through* them.46  Now  sense,  without  the  ordinances  of  nature,  like  faith without  the  ordinances  of  religion,  would  be  no  *principle*  of enjoyment; and the ordinances of nature, without sense, would be no *means* of enjoyment. These are the unalterable decrees of God. There is no exception to them; and there is no reversion of them. To illustrate and enforce the doctrine of this single paragraph is worthy  of  a  volume.  The  essence,  the  whole  essence  of  that reformation for which we contend, is wrapped up in this decree as above expressed. If it be true, the ground on which we stand is firm and unchangeable as the Rock of Ages; if it be false, we build upon the sand. *Reader, examine it well!* 

In  the  Kingdom  of  Heaven,  faith  is,  then,  the  *principle,*  and ordinances  the  *means*  of  enjoyment;  because  all  the  wisdom; power,  love,  mercy,  compassion,  or  *grace  of  God,*  is  in  the ordinances of the Kingdom of Heaven; and if all grace be in them, it can only be enjoined through them. What, then, under the present administration  of  the  Kingdom  of  Heaven,  are  the  ordinances which  contain  the  grace  of  God?  They  are  preaching  the gospel — immersion  in  the  name  of  Jesus,  into  the  name  of  the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit — the reading and teaching  the  Living  Oracles — the  Lord's  day — the  Lord's supper — fasting — prayer — confession  of  sins — and  praise.  To  these may  be  added  other  appointments  of  God,  such  as  exhortation, admonition, discipline, etc.: for these also are ordinances of God; and indeed all statutes and commandments are ordinances:47 but we speak not  at  present of those ordinances which concern the good order of the Kingdom, but of those which are primary means of  enjoyment.  These  primary  and  sacred  ordinances  of  the Kingdom of Heaven are the means of our individual enjoyment of the present salvation of God. 

Without the sun, there is no solar influence; without the moon, there is no lunar influence; without the stars, there is no sidereal influence; without the clouds, there can be no rain; and without the ordinances of the Kingdom of Heaven, there can be no heavenly influence  exhibited  or  felt.  There  is  a  peculiar  and  distinctive influence exerted by the sun, moon, and stars; yet they all give light. So in the ordinances of the Kingdom of Heaven — although they all agree in producing certain similar effects on the subjects of the kingdom, there is something distinctive and peculiar in each of them, so that no one of them can be substituted for another. Not one of them can be dispensed with; they are all necessary to the full enjoyment of the Reign of Heaven. 

In nature and in religion, all the blessings of God bestowed on man are properly classed under two heads. These may be called, for illustration, *antecedent* and *consequent.* The antecedent include all those blessings bestowed on man to prepare him for action and to induce him to action. The consequent are those which God bestows on  man  through  a  course  of  action  correspondent  to  these antecedent blessings. For example, all that God did for Adam in creating  for  him  the  earth  and  all  that  it  contains,  animal, vegetable, mineral; in forming him in his own image; giving him for all his physical, intellectual, and moral powers, and investing him with all the personal and real estate which elevated him above all sublunary beings,  were antecedent  to  any  act  of Adam; and these furnished him with inducements to love, honor, and obey his Creator and benefactor. All that God did for Abraham in promises and precepts before his obedience — all that he did for the Israelites in bringing them up out of Egypt, and redeeming them from the tyranny of Pharaoh, was antecedent to the duties and observances which he enjoined upon them. And all the blessings which Adam, Abraham,  the  Israelites  enjoyed  through  conformity  to  the institutions under which they were placed, were consequent upon that state of mind and course of action which the antedecent favors demanded and occasioned. *God never commanded any being to do anything, but the power and motives were derived from something God had done for him.* 

In  the  Kingdom  of  Heaven  the  antecedent  blessings  are  the constitution of grace, the King, and all that he did, suffered, and sustained for our redemption. These were finished before we came upon the stage of action. This is all favor, pure favor, sovereign favor: for there can be no favor that is not free and sovereign. But the remission of our sins, our adoption into the family of God, our being  made  heirs  and  inheritors  of  the  kingdom  of  glory,  are consequent upon faith and the obedience of faith. 

Organization and life of any sort are of necessity the gifts of God; but health and continued enjoyment of life, and all its various and numerous  blessings  are  consequent  upon  the  proper  exercise  of these. He that will not breathe, eat, drink, sleep, exercise, cannot enjoy animal life. God has bestowed animal organization and life antecedent to any action of the living creature; but the creature may throw away his life by refusing to sustain it by the means essential to its preservation and comfort. 

God made but one man out of the earth, and one earthly *nature* of every sort, by a positive, direct, and immediate agency, of wisdom, power, and goodness. He gave these the power according to his own  constitution  or  *system*  of  nature,  of  reproducing  and multiplying to an indefinite extent. But still this life is transmitted, diffused, and sustained by God operating through the system of nature. So Jesus in the new creation, by his Spirit sent down from heaven  after  his  glorification,  did  by  a  positive,  direct,  and immediate  agency,  create  one  congregation,  one  mystical,  or spiritual body; and, according to the constitution or system of the Kingdom of Heaven, did give to that mystical  body, created in Jerusalem, out of the more ancient earthly Kingdom of God, the power of reproducing and multiplying to an indefinite extent. But still  this  new  and  spiritual  life  is  transmitted,  diffused  and sustained by the Spirit of God, operating through the constitution, or system of grace, ordained in the Kingdom of Heaven. 

Hence, in setting up the Kingdom of Heaven, as in setting up the kingdom of nature, there was a display of divinity, compared with every thing subsequent, properly supernatural. Hence the array of Apostles, prophets, extraordinary teachers, gifts, powers, miracles, etc. etc. But after this new mystical body of Christ was created and made, it had, and yet has, according to the system of grace under the present administration of the Kingdom of Heaven, the power of multiplying and replenishing the whole earth, *and will do it;* for as God breathed into the nostrils of Adam the spirit of life, after he had raised him out of the dust; and as he bestowed on his beloved Son Jesus, after he rose out of the water, the Holy Spirit without measure; so on the formation of the first congregation, figuratively called the *body of Christ,* Jesus did breathe into it the Holy Spirit to animate and inhabit it till he come again. The only temple and habitation on earth, since Jesus pronounced desolation on that in Jerusalem, is the body of Christ. 

Now, the first congregation of Christ, thus filled with the Spirit of God, had the power of raising other congregations of Christ; or, what is the same thing, of causing the body of Christ to grow and increase. Thus we see that other congregations were soon raised up in  Judea  and  Samaria  by  the  members  of  the  Jerusalem  body. Many  were  begotten  to  God  by  the  Spirit  of  God,  through  the members of the first congregation. And since the Spirit himself ceased  to  operate  in  all  those  splendid  displays  of  supernatural grandeur,  by  still  keeping  the  disciples  of  Christ  always  in remembrance of the things spoken by the holy Apostles, and by all the  arguments  derived  from  the  antecedent  blessings  bestowed, working in them both to will and do according to the benevolence of God, he is still causing the body of Christ to grow and increase in *stature,* as well as in knowledge and favor of God. Thus the church of Christ, inspired with his Spirit, and having the oracles and ordinances of the Reign of Heaven, is fully adequate to the conversion of the whole world, if she prove not recreant to her Lord. 

In the work of conversion, her Evangelists, or those whom she sends beyond the precincts of her weekly meetings, have, under the influence of the Spirit of God, simply to propose the constitution, or the glad tidings of the Reign, to those without; and by all the arguments which the oracles of God, and the times and occasions suggest, to beseech and persuade men to be reconciled to God, to kiss  the  Son,  to  accept  the  constitution,  to  bow  to  him  who  is ordained a Prince and a Savior to grant repentance and remission of sins to all who submit to his government. Thus they, and the congregation who sends them forth and sustains them in the work, beget  children  to  God  by  the  gospel,  and  enlarge  the  body  of Christ. 

With all these documents before us, may we not say, that, as Eve was the mother of all living, so "Jerusalem is the mother of us all?" And thus, to use the language of Paul, "Men are begotten to God by the gospel" through the instrumentality of the congregations of Christ. 

Under  the  present  administration  of  the  Kingdom  of  Heaven,  a great apostasy has occurred, as foretold by the Apostles. As the church, compared to a city, is called "Mount Zion," the apostate church  is  called  "Babylon  the  Great."  Like  Babylon  the  type, "Mystery Babylon" the antitype, is to be destroyed by a Cyrus that knows not God. She is to fall by the sword of infidels, supported by the fierce judgments of God. "The Holy City" is still trodden under  foot,  and  the  sanctuary  is  filled  with  corruptions.  It  is, indeed, a den of thieves; but strong is the Lord that judges the apostate city. Till that great and notable day of the Lord come, we cannot, from the prophetic word, anticipate a universal return to the original gospel, nor a general restoration of all the institutions of  the  Kingdom  of  Heaven  in  their  primitive  character;  and, consequently,  we  cannot  promise  to  ourselves  the  universal subjugation of the nations to the sceptre of Jesus. 

But were we to enter upon the consideration of the administration of the affairs of the kingdom after the fall and overthrow of the apostate city and the conversion of the Jews, we should have to launch upon a wide and tempestuous ocean, for which our slender bark is not at this time sufficiently equipped. This may yet deserve the  construction  of  a  large  vessel  in  a  more  propitious  season. Meanwhile  the  original  gospel  is  extensively  proclaimed,  and many thousands are preparing for the day of the Lord; and these are taught by the "Faithful and True Witness" that the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, and that their happiness and safety alike consist in being prepared for his second advent. 

1  These  essays  do  not  appear  in  the  order  in  which  they  were  written  and published.  We  place  the  last-written  first;  because,  in  the  natural  order  of things, general views of the nature of the Christian kingdom ought to precede the special development of its peculiar institutions. They appeared first in the form  of  *extras*  to  the  regular  series  of  the  Millennial  Harbinger;  and  as  we thought it expedient to preserve them, as much as possible, in their original form, this will apologize for several repetitions which may appear in them.  

`  `All the leading and characteristic principles of that reformation for which we plead, as far as the gospel institution is concerned, may be learned from them. Much, indeed, of the proof of some of the propositions found in these essays, lies scattered over the face of several volumes; but such a miniature view of the evidence by which they are sustained, as, in most cases, is sufficient to the conviction of the reader, will be found embodied in them. Those, however, who  may  not  be  perfectly  satisfied  with  the  arguments  offered,  must  be referred to the various discussions of these principles found in the Christian Baptist and Millennial Harbinger.

Part IV: Remission of Sins 

Introduction 

Luther said that the doctrine of justification, or forgiveness, was the test of a standing or falling church. If right in this, she could not be very far wrong in anything else; but if wrong here, it was not easy to suppose her right in anything. I quote from memory, but this was the idea of that great reformer.1 We agree with him in 

this as well as in many other sentiments. Emerging from the smoke of the great city of mystical Babylon, he saw as clearly and as far into these matters as any person could in such a hazy atmosphere. Many of his views only require to be carried out to their legitimate issue, and we should have the ancient gospel as the result. 

The doctrine of remission is the doctrine of salvation: for to talk of salvation without the knowledge of the remission of sins, is to talk without meaning. To give to the Jews, "a knowledge of salvation by  the  remission  of  their  sins,"  was  the  mission  of  John  the Immerser, as said the Holy Spirit. In this way he prepared a people for the Lord. This doctrine of forgiveness was gradually opened to the people during the ministry of John and Jesus, but was not fully developed until Pentecost, when the secrets of the Reign of Heaven were fully opened to men. 

From  Abel  to  the  resurrection  of  Jesus,  transgressors  obtained remission at the altar, through priests and sin offerings; but it was an *imperfect* remission as respected the conscience. "For the law," says  Paul,  (more  perfect  in  this  respect  than  the  preceding economy,) "containing a shadow only of the good things to come, and not even the very image of these things, never can, with the same sacrifices which they offer yearly forever, make those who come to them perfect. Since being offered, would they not have ceased? because the worshippers being once purified, should have no longer conscience of sins."  

The *good things* to come were future during the reign of Moses and his  institution. They  have  come; and a  clear, and full, and perfect remission of sins is the great result of the new economy in the consciences of all the citizens of the kingdom of Jesus. The perfection  of  the  conscience  of  the  worshippers  of  God  under Christ, is the grand distinguishing peculiarity in them compared with those under Moses. They have not only clearer views of God, of his love, of his character, and of immortality; but they have consciences  which  the  Jewish  and  Patriarchal  ages  could  not produce. 

If  faith  only  were  the  means  of  this  superior  perfection  and enjoyment,  and  if  striking  symbols  or  types  were  all  that  were necessary to afford this assurance and experience of pardon, the Jewish people might have been as happy as the Christian people. They  had  as  true  testimony,  as  strong  faith,  and  as  striking emblems as we have. Many of them through faith obtained a high reputation, were approved by God, and admired by men for their wonderful achievements. 

The  difference  is  in  the  constitution.  They  lived  under  a constitution of *law* — we under a constitution of *favor.* Before the law  their  privileges  were  still  more  circumscribed.  Under  the government  of  the  Lord  Jesus  there  is  an  institution  for  the forgiveness of sins, like which there was no institution since the world began. It was owing to this institution that Christians were so much distinguished at first from the subjects of every former institution. 

Our political happiness in these United States is not owing to any other cause than to our political institutions. If we are politically the happiest people in the world, it is because we have the happiest political  institutions  in  the  world.  So  it  is  in  the  Christian institution. If Christians were, and may be, the happiest people that ever  lived,  it  is  because  they  live  under  the  most  gracious institution ever bestowed on men. The meaning of this institution has been buried under the rubbish of human traditions for hundreds of  years.  It  was  lost  in  the  dark  ages,  and  has  never  been,  till recently  disinterred.  Various  efforts  have  been  made,  and considerable progress attended them; but since the Grand Apostasy was  completed,  till  the  present  generation,  the  gospel  of  Jesus Christ has not been laid open to mankind in its original plainness, 

simplicity, and majesty. A vail in reading the New Institution has been on the hearts of Christians, as Paul declares it was upon the hearts of the Jews in reading the Old Institution towards the close of that economy. 

The  object  of  this  essay  is  to  open  to  the  consideration  of  the reader the Christian institution for the remission of sins; to show by what means a person may enjoy the assurance of a personal and plenary remission of all his sins. This we shall attempt to do by stating, illustrating, and proving the following *twelve* propositions: (See next chapter) 

Proposition 1 

***The Apostles taught their disciples, or converts, that their sins were forgiven, and uniformly addressed them as pardoned or justified persons.*** 

John testifies that the youngest disciples were pardoned. "I write to you, little children, because your sins *are forgiven you* on account of his name."2 The young men strong in the Lord and the old men steadfast in the Lord, he commends for their attainments; but the *little children,* the youngest converts, he addressed as possessing this  blessing  as  one  common  to  all  disciples,  "Your  sins  are forgiven you, *on account of his name.*" 

Paul, in his letter to the Hebrews, asserts, that one of the provisions of the New Institution is *the remission of the sins of all under it.* "*Their sins* and iniquities I will remember no more."3 From this he argues, as a first principle, in the Christian economy, "Now where remission of these is, no more offering for sin is needed."4 The reason  assigned  by  the  Apostles  why  *Christians*  have  no  *sin offering*  is,  because  they  have  obtained  remission  of  sins  as  a standing provision in the New Institution. 

The same Apostle testifies that the Ephesian disciples had obtained remission. "Be to one another kind, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God for Christ's sake *has forgiven you.*"5 Here, also, 

in the enumeration of Christian privileges and immunities under Christ,  he  asserts  forgiveness  of  sins  as  the  common  lot  of  all disciples. "In whom we have redemption through his blood, even *the forgiveness of sins,* according to the riches of his favor."6 In his letter to the Colossians, he uses the same words — "By whom we have *the forgiveness of sins.*"7 

Figurative expressions are used by the same Apostle, expressive of the same forgiveness common to all Christians. "And such (guilty characters) were some of you; but *you are washed;* but *you are sanctified;* but *you are justified* by the name of the Lord Jesus, and 


by the Spirit of God."8 Peter, also, is a witness here. "Seeing *you have purified your souls* by obeying the truth through the Spirit."9 

But  there  is  no  need  of  foreign,  or  remote,  or  figurative expressions, when so literally and repeatedly the Apostles assert it as one of the adjuncts of being a disciple of Jesus. Had we no other testimony than that found in a single letter to the Colossians, it would be sufficient to sustain this position. The command as given in chapter 3: 13, assumes it as a principle. "*As Christ forgave you, so  also  do  you.*"  But  in  the  second  chapter  he  makes  this  an inseparable  adjunct  of  being  in  Christ.  "You  are  *complete*  in him — circumcised — buried with him — raised with him — made alive with him — **having forgiven you all trespasses**." 

These  explicit  testimonies  from  the  most  illustrious  witnesses, sustain my first proposition. On these evidences I rely, and I shall henceforth speak of it as a truth not to be questioned, viz.; that all the disciples of Christ converted in the apostolic age, were taught by the Apostles to consider themselves as pardoned persons. 

Proposition 6 

***The apostolic converts were addressed by their teachers as justified persons.*** 

We know that none but innocent persons can be legally justified; but it is not in the forensic sense this term is used by the Apostles. Amongst the Jews it imported no more than *pardoned;* and when applied  to  Christians,  it  denoted  that  they  were  acquitted  from guilt — discharged from condemnation, and accounted as righteous persons in the sight of God. 

Paul, in Antioch in Pisidia, assured the Jews, that *in* or by Jesus all that believed were justified from all things, (certainly here it is equivalent to pardoned from all sins,) from which they could not be  justified  by  the  law  of  Moses.  The  disciples  are  said  to  be justified  by  faith.10  By  favor  or  grace.11  *In*  or  *by*  the  blood  of Christ.12 By the name of the Lord Jesus.13 By works.14 It is God who justifies.15

Christians are said to be justified by God, by Christ, by favor, by faith, by the blood of Jesus, by the *name* of the Lord Jesus, and by the  Spirit  of  God — also  by  works.  Pardon  and  acquittal  are  the prominent  ideas  in  every  application  of  the  term.  God  is  the justifier. Jesus also, as his Messiah, justifies, and the Spirit declares it. As an act of favor it is done, by *the blood of Jesus* as the rightful and efficient cause — *by the faith* as the instrumental cause — by *the name* of Jesus the Lord as the immediate and connecting cause, and by *works,* as the demonstrative and conclusive cause. Nothing is more plain from the above testimonies than that all Christians are declared to be justified under the Reign of Jesus Christ. 

***The ancient Christians were addressed by the Apostles as sanctified persons.*** 

Paul  addressed all the disciples  in  Rome as saints or sanctified persons. In his first letter to the Corinthians, he addresses them all as *the sanctified* under Christ Jesus. "To the congregation of God which  is  at  Corinth,  to  *the  sanctified*  under  Christ  Jesus."  Paul argues with the Hebrews that "by the will of God we are sanctified by  the  offering  of  Jesus  Christ  once  only."  "For  by  this  one offering  he  has  forever  *perfected*  (the  conscience  of)  the *sanctified.*"  So  usual  was  it  for  the  Apostles  to  address  their disciples  as  sanctified  persons,  that  occasionally  they  are  thus designated  in  the  inscription  upon  their  epistles.  Thus  Jude addressing  indiscriminately  the  whole  Christian  community, inscribes his catholic epistle — "To *the sanctified* by God our Father and to the preserved (or saved) by Jesus Christ; to the called." "The sanctifier and the sanctified are all of one family," says the Apostle to  the  Gentiles.  And  therefore  the  sanctifier  addressed  the sanctified  as  his  brethren,  and  the  brethren  the  disciples  as sanctified.  But  once  more  we  must  hear  Paul,  and  hear  him connecting his sanctification with the *name* of the Lord Jesus. He says, "But now you are sanctified by *the name* of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God."16

***The ancient Christians, the apostolic converts, were addressed as "reconciled to God."*** 

Paul repeatedly declares that the disciples were reconciled to God. "When enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son."17  To  the  Corinthians,  he  says,  "God  has  reconciled  us  to himself by Jesus Christ;"18 and to the Colossians, he asserts, "It pleased the Father by him to *reconcile* all things to him, having made peace by the blood of his cross; I say whether they be things on the earth, or things in the heavens. Even you who were formerly alienated in mind, and enemies by works which are wicked, *he has now, indeed, reconciled* in the body of his flesh through death."19 To the Ephesians he declares, that though "once they were without God and without hope in the world, far off, they are now, through the blood of Christ, *made nigh.*" He has made the believing Jews and Gentiles one, that he might, under Christ, *reconcile both in one body to God,* through the cross, having slain the enmity between both thereby. Indeed, he represents God as in Christ, *reconciling a world to himself;* and so all under Christ are frequently said to be reconciled to God through him; which was the point to be proved. 

***The first disciples were considered and addressed by the Apostles, as "adopted into the family of God."*** 

This adoption is presented by the Apostle as the great reason which called forth the Son of God. "God," he says, "sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, that he might buy off those under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons." "And because you *are sons,* he sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying *Abba,* Father."20 "You are, therefore, now sons of God." 

Indeed, the same writer, in his letter to the Ephesians, goes still farther, and represents this adoption of Jews and Gentiles into the rank and dignity of the sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty, as the great object contemplated in God's predestination. "Having," says  he,  "predestinated,  or  beforehand  determinately  pointed  us out, for an *adoption* into the number of children by Jesus Christ, *for himself,* according to the good pleasure of his will."21 Another testimony must suffice on this point. "Beloved," says the Apostle John, "*now* are we *the sons of God;* and what manner of love God has bestowed upon us, that we should be called *sons of God!*" "If sons, then we are heirs of God — joint heirs with Christ." 

***My sixth proposition is, that the first Christians were taught by the inspired teachers to consider themselves as saved persons.*** 

Because  of  some  ambiguity  in  the  popular  import  of  the  term *saved,* when applied to the disciples of Christ, we shall define it as used in this proposition. I need not here descant upon the temporal saviors and temporal salvations which are so conspicuous in sacred history. I need not state that Noah and his family were saved from the judgment inflicted upon the Old World; the Israelites from the Egyptians,  and  from  all  their  enemies — that  Paul's  companions were  saved  from  the  deep,  and  God's  people  in  all  ages,  in common with all mankind, from ten thousand perils to which their persons, their families, and their property have been exposed: It is not the present salvation of our bodies from the ills of this life; but it  is  *the  salvation  of  the  soul*  from  the  guilt,  pollution,  and dominion of sin. "Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." It is the salvation of the soul in the present life of which we speak. And here it ought to be clearly and distinctly stated that there is a *present* and a *future* salvation, of which all Christians are to be partakers. The former is properly *the salvation of the soul,* and the latter is *the salvation of the body,* at the resurrection of the just. There are few professing Christianity, perhaps none, who do not expect a future salvation — the glory of salvation to be revealed in us at the last time. Peter who uses this expression in the beginning of his first epistle, and who invites the saints  to  look  forward  to  the  salvation  yet  future,  in  the  same connection reminds them that they have *now* received the salvation of the soul. Indeed, the salvation of the soul is but the *first fruit* of the Spirit, and but an earnest until the adoption, "the redemption of the body" from the bondage of corruption. It was in this sense of the word that salvation was announced to all who submitted to the Lord  Jesus,  and  hence  it  is  in  this  connection  equivalent  to  a deliverance of the soul from the guilt, pollution, and dominion of sin. Having thus defined the present salvation of the soul, I proceed to the proof of my sixth proposition, viz.; that the first Christians 


were taught by their inspired teachers to consider themselves as *saved persons.* 

Peter, on Pentecost, exhorted the Jews to *save themselves* from that untoward generation, by reforming and being "immersed for the remission of their sins, in the name of the Lord Jesus." Luke, in recording the success attendant on Peter's labors, expresses himself thus: "And the Lord added, daily, *the saved* to the congregation."22

Those  who  obeyed  the  gospel,  were  recorded  by  Luke  as  "*the saved.*" The King's translators, supplied out of their own system the words "*should be.*"  They are not in  any copy of the Greek Scriptures. Such is the first application of the words, "*the saved*" in the Christian scriptures. 

Paul uses the same words in the first letter to the Corinthians, and applies them to all the disciples of Jesus. "To the destroyed, the doctrine of the cross is foolishness; but to us, *the saved,* it is the power of God."23 In the same letter, he says of the Gospel, "By which *you are saved,* if you retain in your memory the word which I announce to you."24 In his second letter he uses the same style, and distinguishes the disciples by the same designation: "We are through God a fragrant odor of Christ among *the saved,* and among the destroyed." The Ephesians he declares *are saved* through favor; and  to  Titus,  he  says,  "God  has  *saved*  us  not  by  works  of righteousness  which  we  have  done,  but  according  to  his  own mercy" — by what means we shall soon hear Paul affirm. Promises of salvation to the obedient are to be found in almost every public address pronounced by the Apostles and first preachers. For the Savior commanded them to assure mankind that every one who believed  the  gospel,  and  was  immersed,  should  be  saved.  And, connecting  faith  with  immersion,  Peter  averred  that  immersion *saved*  us,  purifying  the  conscience  through  the  resurrection  of Jesus.25

While the Christians are taught to expect and hope for a  *future* salvation — a salvation from the power of death and the grave — a salvation to be revealed in the last time — they receive the first fruit of the Spirit, the salvation of the soul from guilt, pollution, and the dominion of sin, and come under the dominion of righteousness, 

peace, and joy. This is what Peter affirms of all the Christians in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia Minor, and Bithynia, to whom he thus speaks: "Jesus, having not seen, you love; on whom, not now looking, but believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, receiving the reward of your faith, *the salvation of your souls.*"26

These six propositions being each and every one of them, clearly sustained by the unequivocal testimony of God, now adduced, and, as  is  well  known  to  the  intelligent  disciple,  by  many  more passages, equally plain and forcible, not adduced; we shall now engross them into one leading proposition, which we shall in this essay consider as not to be questioned — as irrefragably proved. 

*The converts made to Jesus Christ by the Apostles were taught to consider  themselves  pardoned,  justified,  sanctified,  reconciled, adopted, and saved; and were addressed as pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved persons, by all who first preached the Gospel of Christ.* 

While this proposition is before us, it may be expedient to remark that all these terms are expressive not of any quality of mind — not of any personal attribute of body, soul, or spirit; but each of them represents, and all of them together represent *a state* or *condition.* But though these terms represent state and not character, there is a relation between state and character, or an influence which state has upon character, which makes the state of immense importance in a moral and religious point of view. 

Indeed, the strongest arguments which the Apostles use with the Christians to urge them forward in the cultivation and display of all the moral and religious excellencies of character, are drawn from the  meaning  and  value  of  the  *state*  in  which  they  are  placed. Because  forgiven,  they  should  forgive;  because  justified,  they should live righteously; because sanctified, they should live holy and unblameably; because reconciled to God, they should cultivate peace  with  all  men,  and  act  benevolently  towards  all;  because adopted, they should walk in the dignity and purity of sons of God; because saved, they should abound in thanksgivings, praises, and rejoicings, living soberly, righteously, and godly, looking forward to the blessed hope. 

As  this  essay  is  designated  for  readers  of  the  most  common capacity and most superficial education, I trust I may be permitted to speak still more plainly upon the difference between *state* and *character.* Childhood is a state; so is manhood. Now, a person in the state of childhood may act sometimes like a person in the state of manhood, and those arrived at the state of manhood may in character or behavior resemble those in a state of childhood. A person in the state of a son, may have the character of a servant; and a person in the state of a servant may have the character of a son.  This  is  not  generally  to  be  expected,  though  it  sometimes happens. Parents and children, masters and servants, husbands and wives, are terms denoting relations or states. To act in accordance with these states or relations is quite a different thing from being in any  one  of  these  states.  Many  persons  enter  into  the  state  of matrimony, and yet act unworthily of it. This is true of many other states. Enough, we presume, is said to contradistinguish state and character, relations and moral qualities. 

It  is  scarcely necessary to  remark here, that as the disciples of Christ  are  declared  to  be  in  a  pardoned,  justified,  sanctified, reconciled, adopted, and saved state, they are the only persons in such  a  state;  and  all  others  are  in  an  unpardoned,  unjustified, unsanctified, unreconciled, unadopted, and lost state. 

*When, then, is a change of state effected, and by what means?* This is the great question soon to be discussed. 

We are constrained to  admit that a change in  any one of these states necessarily implies, because it involves, a change in all the others.  Every  one  who  is  *pardoned*  is  justified,  sanctified, reconciled, adopted and saved, and so every one that is *saved* is adopted, reconciled, sanctified, justified, and pardoned. 

To illustrate what has already been proved, let us turn to some of the changes which take place in society as a present constituted. A female changes her state. She enters into the state of matrimony. So  soon  as  she  has  surrendered  herself  to  the  affectionate government and control of him who has become her husband, she had not only become a wife, but a daughter, a sister, an aunt, a niece, etc.; and may stand in many other relations in which she before stood not. All these are connected with her becoming the wife of a person who stands in many relations. So when a person becomes Christ's, he is a son of Abraham, an heir, a brother, or is pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted and saved.  

To be *in* Christ, or *under* Christ, then, is to stand in these new relations to God, angels, and men; and to be out of him, or not under his mediatorship or government, is to be in, or under Adam under.  It  is  to  be  in,  what  is  called  "the  state  of  nature," unpardoned, unjustified, unsanctified, unreconciled, and an alien from the family of God, lost in trespasses and sins. 

These  things  premised,  the  question  presents  itself,  *When  are persons in Christ?* I choose this phrase in accommodation to the familiar style of this day. No person *in* a house, *in* a ship, *in* a state, *in* a kingdom, but he that has gone or is introduced *into* a house, *into* a ship, *into* a state, *into* a kingdom; so no person is *in* Christ but he who has been introduced *into* Christ. The scripture style is most religiously accurate. We have the words "*in Christ,*" and the words "*into Christ,*" often repeated in the Christian Scriptures; but in no place can the one phrase be substituted for the other. Hence in all places, where any person is said to be *in Christ,* it refers not to his conversion, regeneration, or putting on Christ, but to a state of  rest  or  privilege  subsequent  to  conversion,  regeneration,  or putting on Christ. But the phrase *into Christ* is always connected with  conversion,  regeneration,  immersion,  or  putting  on  Christ. Before we are justified in Christ, live in Christ, or fall asleep in Christ, we must come, be introduced, or immersed into Christ. *Into* belongs only to verbs implying motion towards; and *in* to verbs implying rest, or motion in. He eats, sleeps, sits in the house. He walks into the field; he rides into the city. "Into Christ" is a phrase only applicable to conversion, immersion, or regeneration, or what is  called  putting  on  Christ,  translation  into  his  kingdom,  or submission to his government.27

Presuming on the intelligence of our readers, so far as to suppose them  assured  that  this  is  no  mere  verbal  criticism,  but  a discrimination that detects one of the pillars of an apostate church, I proceed to another preliminary proposition, which I choose to submit in the following word, *to wit:* 

Proposition 7 

***A change of views, though it necessarily precedes, is in no case equivalent to, and never to be identified with, a change of state.*** 

In all the relations of his life, in all states or conditions of men, we feel the truth of this; and I would to Heaven that our readers could see as plainly what is of infinitely more importance to them, that no change of heart is equivalent to, or can be substituted for, a change of state! A change of heart is the result  of a change of views,  and  whatever  can  accomplish  a  change  of  views  may accomplish  a  change  of  heart  or  feeling,  but  a  change  of  state always calls for something more.28

Lavinia was the servant of Palemon, and once thought him a hard master. She changed her views of him, and her feelings were also changed towards him; still, however, she continued in the state of a hand maid. Palemon offered her first his heart, and then his hand, and she accepted them. He vowed and she vowed before witnesses, and she became his wife. Then, and not till then, was her state changed. She is no longer a *servant* — she is now a *wife.* A change of views and of feelings led to this change in state; but let it be noted  that  this  might  not  have  issued  in  a  change  of  state;  for Maria, who was another handmaid of Palemon, and changed her views of him and her feelings towards him as much — nay, more than did  Lavinia;  yet  Maria lived and died the servant maid of Palemon and Lavinia. 

William Agricola and his brother Thomas, both Canadians, were once  much  opposed  to  the  constituted  government  of  New England.  They  both  changed  their  views,  and,  as  a  matter  of course, their feelings were changed. William became a citizen of Rhode Island; but Thomas, notwithstanding his change of heart, lived and died a colonial subject of a British king. 

John  and  James  Superbus  became  great  enemies  to  each  other. They continued irreconciled for many years. At length a change of views brought about a change of heart: but this change for more 


than  a  year  was  concealed  in  the  heart,  and  by  no  overt  act appeared. They were not reconciled until mutual concessions were made  and  pledges  of  a  change  of  feeling  were  tendered  and reciprocated. From enemies they became friends. 

A thousand analogies might be adduced, to show that though a change  of  state  often — nay,  generally  results  from  a  change  of feelings, and this from a change of views, yet a change of state does not generally follow, and is something quite different from, and cannot be identified with a change of heart. So in religion, a man may change his views of Jesus, and his heart may be changed towards  him;  but  unless  a  change  of  state  ensures,  he  is  still unpardoned,  unjustified,  unsanctified,  unreconciled,  unadopted, and lost to all Christian life and enjoyable. For it has been proved that these terms represent states and not feelings, condition and not character; and that a change of views or of heart, is not a change of state. To change a state is to pass into a new relation, and relation is  not  sentiment  nor  feeling.  Some  *act,*  then,  constitutional,  by stipulation proposed, sensible, and manifest, must be performed by one or both the parties before such a change can be accomplished. Hence, always, in ancient times, the proclamation of the gospel was accompanied by some instituted act proposed to those whose views were changed, by which their state was to be changed, and by which they were to stand in a new relation to Jesus Christ. 

This  brings  us  to  "*the  obedience  of  faith.*"  From  the  time  the proclamation of God's philanthropy was first made, there was an act  of  obedience  proposed  in  it  by  which  the  believers  in  the proclamation were put in actual possession of its blessings, and by conformity to which act a change of state ensued. 

To  perceive  what  this  act  of  faith  is,  it  must  be  remarked  that where there is no *command* there can be no *obedience.* These are correlate  terms.  A  message  or  proclamation  which  has  not  a command in it, cannot be obeyed. But the gospel can be obeyed or disobeyed, and therefore in it there is a command. Lest any person should hesitate in a matter of such importance, we will prove, 

Proposition 8 

***The gospel has in it a command, and as such must be obeyed.*** 

And here I need only ask, Who are they who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord? Paul replies, 'They who know not God, and *obey not the gospel of his Son.*'29 To 'obey the gospel,' and to 'become obedient to the faith,' were common phrases in the apostolic discourses and writings. 'By whom we have received apostleship, in order to the *obedience of faith*  in  all  nations,  on  account  of  his  name.'30  'By  the commandment of the everlasting God, the gospel is made known to all nations for the *obedience of faith.*'31 'A great company of the priests  became  obedient  to  the  faith'  32  'But  they  have  not  all obeyed the gospel;'33 and, 'What shall be the end of them who *obey not the gospel*'?34 From these sayings it is unquestionably plain, that either the gospel itself, taken as a whole, is a command, or that in it there is a command through the obedience of which salvation is enjoyed. 

The  obedience  of  the  gospel  is  called  the  obedience  of  faith compared  with  the  obedience  of  law.  Faith  in  God's  promise through  Jesus  Christ  being  the  principle  from  which  obedience flows. To present the gospel in the form of a command is an act of favor, because it engages the will and the affections of men, and puts it in their power to have an assurance of their salvation from which  they  would  be  necessarily  excluded  if  no  such  act  of obedience were enjoyed. 

Whatever the act of faith may be, it necessarily becomes the line of discrimination  between the two states  before described. On this side, and on that, mankind are in quite different states. On the one side they  are pardoned, justified, sanctified, reconciled, adopted and saved: on the other, they are in a state of condemnation. This act is sometimes called immersion, regeneration, conversion; and, that this act may appear obvious to all, we shall be at some pains to confirm and illustrate it. 


That a relation or a state can be changed by an act, I need scarcely at this time attempt to prove; especially to those who know that the act of marriage, of naturalization, adoption, and their being born, changes  the  state  of  the  subject  of  such  acts.  But,  rather  than attempt to prove that a state is or may be changed by an act, I should rather ask if any person has heard, knows, or can conceive of  a  state  being  changed  without  some  act?  This  point,  being conceded to us by all the rational, we presume not to prove. But a question may arise whether *faith* itself, or an act of obedience to some  command  or  institution,  is  that  act  by  which  our  state  is changed. 

Proposition 9 

***That it is not faith, but an act resulting from faith, which changes our state, we shall now attempt to prove.***  

No relation in which we stand to the material world — no political relation, or relation to society, can be changed by believing, apart from the acts to which that belief, or faith, induces us. Faith never made an American citizen, though it may have been the cause of many  thousands  migrating  to  this  continent,  and  ultimately becoming citizens of these United States. Faith never made a man a husband, a father, a son, a brother, a master, a servant, though it may have been essentially necessary to  all these relations, as a cause, or principle preparatory, or tending thereunto. — Thus, when in scripture men are said to be justified by faith, or to receive any blessing through faith, it is because faith is the principle of action, and, as such, the cause of those acts by which such blessings are enjoyed. But the principle without those acts is nothing; and it is only by the acts which it induces to perform, that it becomes the instrument of any blessings to man. 

Many blessings are metonymically ascribed to faith in the sacred writings. We are said to be justified, sanctified, and purified by faith — to  walk  by faith,  and to  live by  faith,  etc. etc. But these sayings,  as  qualified  by  the  Apostles,  mean  no  more  than  by believing the truth of God *we have access* into all these blessings. So that as Paul explains, 'By faith *we have access* into the favor in which we stand.' These words he uses on two occasions,35 when speaking  of  the  value  of  this  principle,  contrasted  with  the principle of law; and in his letter to the Hebrews, when he brings up his cloud of witnesses to the excellency of this principle, he shows that *by it* the ancients obtained a high reputation — that is, as he explain, by their acts of faith in obedience to God's commands. 

That  faith  by  itself  neither  justifies,  sanctifies,  nor  purifies,  is admitted by those who oppose immersion for the forgiveness of sins. They all include the idea of the *blood of Christ.* And yet they 


seem not to perceive, that, in objecting to immersion as necessary to  forgiveness  in  connection  with  faith,  their  own  arguments preclude them from connecting the blood of Christ with faith. If they admit that faith, apart from the blood of Christ, cannot obtain pardon, they admit all that is necessary to prove them inconsistent with themselves in opposing immersion for the remission of sins; or immersion, as that act by which our state is changed. 

The Apostle Peter, when first publishing the gospel to the Jews, taught them that they were not forgiven their sins by faith; but by an act of faith, by a believing immersion into the Lord Jesus. That this may appear evident to all, we shall examine his Pentecostian address, and his Pentecostian hearers. 

Peter now holding the keys of the kingdom of Jesus, and speaking under  the  commission  of  converting  the  world,  and  by  the authority of the Lord Jesus; guided, inspired, and accompanied by the Spirit — may be expected to speak the truth, the whole truth, plainly and intelligibly, to his brethren the Jews. He had that day declared  the  gospel  facts,  and  proved  the  resurrection  and ascension of Jesus to the conviction of thousands. They believed and repented — believed that Jesus was the Messiah, had died as a sin-offering, was risen from the dead, and crowned Lord of all. Being  full  of  this  faith,  they  inquired  of  Peter  and  the  other Apostles *what they ought to do* to obtain remission. They were informed, that though they now believed and repented, they were not pardoned; but must '*reform and be immersed for the remission of sins.*' Immersion for the forgiveness of sins, was *the command* addressed to these believers, to these penitents, in answer to the most earnest question; and by one of the most sincere, candid, and honest speakers ever heard. This act of faith was presented as that act by which a change in their state could be effected; or, in other words, by which alone they could be pardoned. They who 'gladly received this word were that day immersed;' or, in other words, the same day were converted, or regenerated, or obeyed the gospel. Those expressions, in the Apostle's style, when applied to persons coming into the kingdom, denote the same act, as will be perceived from the various passages in the writings of Luke and Paul. This testimony, when the speaker, the occasion, and the congregations 

are all taken into view, is itself alone sufficient to establish the point in support of which we have adduced it. 

But the second discourse, recorded by Luke from the lips of the same Peter, pronounced in Solomon's Portico, is equally pointed, clear, and full in support of this position. After he had explained the miracles which he had wrought in the name of the Lord Jesus, and  stated  the  same  gospel  facts,  he  proclaims  the  same command — "Reform  and  be  converted,  that  your  sins  may  be blotted out;" or, "Reform and turn to God, that so your sins may be blotted out; that season of refreshment from the presence of the Lord may come, and that he may send Jesus whom the heavens must receive till the accomplishment of all the things which God has  foretold,"  etc.  Peter,  in  substituting  other  terms  in  this proclamation, for those used on Pentecost, does not preach a *new* gospel, but *the same* gospel in terms equally strong. He uses the same word in the first part of the command, which he used on Pentecost. Instead of "*be immersed,*" he has here "*be converted,*" or "*turn to God;*" instead of "*for the remission of your sins,*" here it is, "*that  your  sins  may  be  blotted  out;*"  and  instead  of  "*you  shall receive  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Spirit,*"  here  it  is,  "*that  seasons  of refreshment  from  the  presence  of  the  Lord  may  come.*"36  On 

Pentecost, it was, 1st. "Reform." 2d. "Be immersed." 3d. "For the remission of sins." And 4th. "You shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."  In  Solomon's  Portico,  it  was,  1st.  "Reform."  2d.  "Be converted."  3d.  "That  your  sins  may  be  blotted  out."  And  4th. "That seasons of refreshment from the presence of the Lord may come;" that "you may have righteousness, peace, and joy in a holy spirit." So read the different clauses in those two discourses to the Jews, expressive of the same acts. 

There  is  yet,  in  this  discourse  in  the  Portico,  a  very  strong expression, declarative of the same gracious connection between immersion  and  remission.  It  is  the  last  period  in  the  discourse. "Unto you, first, brethren of the Jews, God having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to *bless you,* every one of you, in the act of turning from your iniquities;" or, as we would say, in the act of conversion. Why the Apostle Peter should have used "converted," or "turning to God," instead of "be immersed," is, to the candid and unprejudiced reader of this narrative, very plain. After Pentecost, the disciples immersed on that day, *having turned to God* through Jesus, were spoken of by their brethren as *discipled* or *converted* to Jesus.  The  unbelieving  Jews,  soon  after  Pentecost,  knew  the disciples called the immersed "*converted;*" and immersion being the  act  of  faith  which  drew  the  line  of  demarcation  between Christians and Jews, nothing could be more natural than to call the act of immersion the converting of a Jew. The time intervening between  these  discourses  was  long  enough  to  introduce  and familiarize this style in the metropolis; so that when a Christian said, "*Be converted,*" or "*Turn to God,*" every Jew knew, the act of putting on the Messiah to be that intended. After the immersion of some Gentiles into the faith, in the house and neighborhood of Cornelius, it was reported that the Gentiles were converted to God. Thus, the Apostles in passing through the country, gave great joy to  the  disciples  from  among  the  Jews,  "telling  them  of  the conversion" or immersion of the Gentiles.37 Indeed, in a short time it was a summary way of representing the faith, reformation, and immersion of disciples, by using one word for all. Thus, "All the inhabitants of Sharon and Lydda turned," or "were converted, to the Lord."38

While on the subject  of conversion, we shall adduce, as  fourth testimony, the words of the Lord Jesus to Paul, when he called him. Paul is introduced by Luke in the Acts, telling what the Lord said to him when he received his apostleship. "I send you Paul, by the faith that respects me, to open their eyes; to *turn* or *convert* them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that  they  may  receive  forgiveness  of  sins,  and  an  inheritance among the saved."39 Every thing to be accomplished among the Gentiles was to be effected by the faith or truth in Christ. The Savior  connected  that  with  opening  their  eyes;  their  conversion from the ignorance and tyranny of sin and Satan; their forgiveness of sins; and finally, an inheritance among the saved or sanctified. First,  faith  or  illumination;  then,  conversion;  then,  remission  of sins; then, the inheritance. All these testimonies concur with each other in preaching the act of faith — Christian immersion, frequently called  *conversion,*  as  that  act,  inseparably  connected  with  the remission of sins; or that change of state, of which we have already spoken. 

One reason why we would arrest the attention of the reader to the substitution of the terms *convert* and *conversion,* for *immerse* and *immersion,* in the apostolic discourses and in the sacred writings, is not so much for the purpose of proving that the forgiveness of sins, or a change of state, is necessarily connected with the act of faith called  "Christian  immersion:"  as  it  is  to  fix  the  minds  of  the biblical students upon a very important fact, viz.; that no person is altogether discipled to Christ until he is immersed. It is true, that this view of the matter bears strongly upon the question; but it bears upon other great matters pertaining to the present and ancient order of things. 

Discovering that much depends upon having correct views on this point,  we  have  carefully  examined  all  those  passages  where "conversion" either in the common version, or in the new version, or in the original, occurs; and have found a uniformity in the use of this term, and its compounds and derivatives, which warrants the conclusion, that no person was said to be converted until he was immersed; and that all persons who were immersed were said to be converted. If any apostatized, and were again converted, it was in that sense in which our Lord applied the word to Peter, "When you are *converted,* strengthen your brethren," or, as James used it in his letter when he said,  "If any of  you err from the truth, and one convert him, let him know that he who converts a transgressor from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and hide a multitude of sins." 

The commission for converting the world teaches that immersion was necessary to discipleship; for Jesus said, "Convert the nations, immersing  them  into  the  name,"  etc.  and  "teaching  them  to observe," etc. The construction of the sentence fairly indicates that no person can be a disciple, according to the commission, who has not been immersed: *for the active participle in connection with an imperative,  either  declares  the  manner  in  which  the  imperative shall be obeyed, or explains the meaning of the command.* To this I have not found an exception: — for example. —  "Cleanse the house, sweeping it." "Cleanse the garment, washing it," shows the manner in which the command is to be obeyed, or explains the meaning of it. Thus, "Convert (or disciple) the nations, immersing them, and teaching them to observe," etc. expresses the manner in which the command is to be obeyed. 

If the Apostles had only preached and not immersed, they would not have converted the hearers according to the commission: and if they had immersed, and not taught them to observe the commands of the Savior, they would have been transgressors. A disciple, then, according  to  the  commission,  is  one  that  has  heard  the  gospel, believed it, and has been immersed. A disciple, indeed, is one that continues in keeping the commandments of Jesus.40

Proposition 10 

***I now proceed to show that immersion and washing of          regeneration are two Bible names for the same act, contemplated in two different points of view.*** 

The term *regeneration* occurs but twice in the common version of the New Testament, and not once in the Old Testament. The first is Matt. 19:28. "You that have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of his glory, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." Dr. George  Campbell,  following  the  punctuation  adopted  by Griesbach,  and  substituting  the  word  *renovation*  instead  of *regeneration,* renders it, "That, at the *renovation,* when the Son of Man shall be seated on his glorious throne,  you, my followers, sitting also upon twelve thrones," etc. *Genesis,* being the term used for  *creation,  palingenesia,*  denotes  the  new  creation — either literally  at  the  resurrection  of  the  dead,  or  figuratively  at  the commencement of the Christian era, or at the commencement of the Millennium. Josephus, the Jew, called the return of Israel to their  own  land  and  institution,  "The  Regeneration"  or "Palingenesia." 

No  writer  of  any  note,  critic  or  expositor,  supposes  that *regeneration* in Matt. 19 applies to what is, in theology, called the *new birth, or regeneration of the soul* — not even the Presbyterian Matthew  Henry,  nor  Dr.  Whitby,  Campbell,  Macknight, Thompson; nor, indeed, any writer we recollect ever to have read. Regeneration in this passage denotes a state, a new state of things. In the same sense we often use the term. The American revolution was  the  regeneration  of  the  country  or  the  government.  The commencement of the Christian era was a regeneration — so will be the creation of the new Heavens and new Earth. As this is so plain a  matter,  and  so  generally  admitted,  we  proceed  to  the  second occurrence of this term. 

"God saved us by *the washing of regeneration,* and renewing of the  Holy  Spirit."41  God  has  saved  us  through  the  *bath  of* 

*regeneration,*  and  the  renewing  of  the  Holy  Spirit.  This  is  the second time the word *regeneration* is found in the New Testament; and  here  it  is  conceded  by  the  most  learned  Paidobaptists  and Baptists, that it refers to immersion. Though I have been led to this conclusion from my views of the Christian religion, yet I neither hold it myself, nor justify it to others on this account. I choose rather to establish it by other testimonies than by those who agree with me in the import of this institution. Among these I shall place Dr.  James  Macknight,  formerly  prolocutor  or  moderator  of  the Presbyterian church of Scotland, and translator of the Apostolic Epistles.  One  of  his  notes  upon  Titus  3:5,  is  in  the  following words: — "Through  the  bath  of  regeneration."  "Through  *baptism,* called the bath of regeneration, not because any change in nature" (but  I  would  not  say  in  the  *state*)  "of  the  baptized  person  is produced  by  baptism;  but  because  it  is  an  emblem  of  the purification of his soul from sin." He then quotes in proof, (Acts 22:16.)  "Arise,  and  be  immersed,  and  wash  thee  from  thy sins." — *Paul.* He supports this view also from Eph. 5:26, and John 3:5. "The bath of regeneration," is then according to this learned Paidobaptist, Christian immersion. 

Parkhurst,  in  his  Lexicon,  upon  the  word  *loutron,*  connects  the same *phrase,* the washing or bath of regeneration, with Eph. 5:26, and John 3:5, as alluding to immersion. So say all the critics, one by  one,  as  far  as  I  know.  Even  Matthew  Henry,  the  good  and venerable Presbyterian commentator, concedes this point also, and quotes Eph. 5:26, Acts 22:16, and Matt. 28:19-20, in support of the conclusion that the *washing of regeneration* refers to baptism. 

Our opponents themselves being judges, we have gained this point, viz.  that the only  time  that the phrase  *washing  of  regeneration* occurs in the New Testament, with reference to a personal change, it means, or is equivalent to, immersion. *Washing of regeneration and immersion, are therefore only two names for the same thing.* Although I might be justified in proceeding to another topic, and in supposing this point to be fully established, I choose rather, for the sake of *the slow to apprehend,* to fortify this conclusion by some other testimonies and arguments. 

As regeneration is taught to be equivalent to "*being born again,*" and understood to be of the same import with a new birth, we shall examine it under this metaphor. For if immersion be equivalent to regeneration, and regeneration be of the same import with being born  again,  then  being  born  again  and  being  immersed  are  the same thing; for this plain reason, that things which are equal to the same  thing,  are  equal  to  one  another.  *All  must  admit,  that  no person can be born again of that which he receives.* For as no person is born naturally — so no person can be born again, or born metaphorically — of that which he receives. It destroys the idea, the figure,  the  allusion,  and  every  thing  else  which  authorizes  the application of these words to any change which takes place in man, to suppose that the subject of the new birth, or regeneration, is born again  of  something  which  he  has  received.  This  single  remark shows the impropriety, and inaccuracy of thought; or, perhaps, the want of thought which the popular notions of regeneration sanction and sanctify. 

In  being  born  naturally  there  is  the  begetter,  and  that  which  is begotten. These are not the same. The act of being born is different from  that  which  is  born.  Now  the  Scriptures  carry  this  figure through  every  prominent  point  of  coincidence.  There  is  the begetter. "Of his own will he hath begotten or impregnated us;" says James the Apostle. "*By the word of truth,*" as the incorruptible seed; or, as Peter says, "We are born again, not from corruptible, but  from  incorruptible  seed,  the  word  of  God  which  endureth forever." But when the act of being born is spoken of, then the water is introduced. Hence, before we come into the kingdom we are born of water. 

The Spirit of God is the begetter, the gospel is the seed; and being thus begotten and quickened, we are born of the water. A child is alive before it is born, and the act of being born only changes its state, not its life. Just so in the metaphorical birth. Persons are begotten by the Spirit of God, impregnated by the word, and born of the water. 

In one sense a person is born of his father; but not until he is first born of his mother. So in every place where water and the Spirit, or water and the Word, are spoken of, *the water stands first.* Every child is born of its father, when it is born of its mother. Hence the Savior put the mother first, and the Apostles follow him. No other reason can be assigned for placing the water first. How uniform this style! Jesus says to Nicodemus, "You must be born again, or you cannot discern the reign of God." *Born again!* What means this? "Nicodemus, unless you are born of water and the Spirit you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God." So Paul speaks to the Eph. 5:26, "He cleansed the  church," or the disciples, "by  *a bath  of water,  and  the  Word.*"  And  to  Titus  he  says,  "He  saved  the disciples *by the bath* of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit." Now, as soon as, and not before, a disciple, who has been begotten of God, is born of water, he is born of God, or of the Spirit. *Regeneration is, therefore, the act of being born.*42 Hence its connection always with water. Reader, reflect — what a jargon, what a confusion, have the mystic doctors made of this metaphorical expression, and of this topic of regeneration. To call the receiving of any spirit, or any influence, or energy, or any operation upon the heart of man, regeneration, is an abuse of all speech, as well as a departure from the diction of the Holy Spirit, *who calls nothing personal regeneration, except the act of immersion.*43

Some curious criticisms have been offered, to escape the force of the plain declaration of Jesus and his Apostles, upon this subject. Some say, that the words, "Except a man be born of water and Spirit," are not to be understood literally. Surely, then, if to be born of water does not mean to be born of water, to be born of the Spirit must mean something else than to be born of the Spirit. This is so fanatical and extravagant as to need no other exposure. He who cannot see the propriety of calling immersion a being born again, can  see  no  propriety  in  any  metaphor  in  common  use.  A resurrection is a new birth. Jesus is said to be the *first born* from the dead; because the first who rose from the dead to die no more. And, surely, there is no abuse of speech, but the greatest propriety in saying, that he who has died to sin, and been buried in water, when  raised  up  again  out  of  that  element,  is  born  again  or regenerated.  If  Jesus  was  born  again,  when  he  came  out  of  a sepulchre, surely he is born again who is raised up out of the grave of waters. 

Those who are thus begotten and born of God, are children of God. It would be monstrous supposition, that such persons are not freed from their sins. *To be born of God, and born in sin, is conceivable.* Remission of sins is as certainly granted to "*the born of God,*" as life eternal, and deliverance from corruption, will be granted to the *children of the resurrection,* when born from the grave. 

To illustrate what has, we presume to say, been now proved, we shall  consider  *political  regeneration.*  Though  the  term *regeneration* is laxly employed in this association; yet, by such a license  of  speech,  we  may  illustrate  this  subject  to  the apprehension  of  all.  Yes,  the  whole  subject  of  faith,  change  of heart, regeneration, and character. 

All the civilized nations and kingdoms have constitutions; and in their  constitutions  they  have  declared  who  are  members  of  the social compact. Besides those who compose the community at the time a constitution is adopted, they say who shall participate its blessings in all time coming; that is, who shall be admitted into it, and by what means they shall become members of it. They have always decreed that their own posterity shall inherit their political rights and immunities. But they have, also ordained that foreigners; that is, members of other communities, may become, by adoption, or  naturalization,  citizens,  or  fellow  members  of  the  same community.  But  they  have,  in  their  wisdom  and  benevolence, instituted  a  rite  or  form  of  adoption,  which  form  has  much meaning; and which when submitted to, changes the state of the subject of it. Now, as the Savior consented to be called a *King,* and to call the community over which he presides a *Kingdom,* it was because of the analogy between these human institutions and his institution; and for the purpose not of confounding, but of aiding the  human  mind  in  apprehending  and  comprehending  the  great object of his mission to the world. And it is worthy of the most emphatic attention, that it was **when speaking of a kingdom, he spoke of being born again**. Yes, on that occasion, and on that occasion only, when he spoke of *entering into his kingdom,* did he speak of the necessity of **being born again**. And had he not chosen that figure he would not have chosen the figure of *a new birth.* With  these  facts  and  circumstances  before  us  let  us  examine political  regeneration  as  the  best  conceivable  illustration  of religious regeneration. 

A. B. was born in the island of Great Britain, a native subject of George III. king of Great Britain. He was much attached to his native  island,  to  the  people,  the  manner  and  customs  of  his ancestors and kinsmen. With all these attachments still increasing, he grew up to manhood. Then he heard the report of this good land, of this large, fertile, and most desirable country. The country, the people, and the government, were represented to him in the most  favorable  light.  Sometimes  these  representations  were exaggerated; but still he could separate the truth from the fable: and was fully persuaded not only of the existence of these United States,  but  also  of  the eligibility  of  being  a  citizen  thereof.  He believed  the  testimony  which  he  heard,  resolved  to  expatriate himself from the land of his nativity, to imperil life and property, putting  himself  aboard  of  a  ship,  and  bidding  adieu  to  all  the companions of his youth, his kinsmen, and dear friends. So full was his conviction, and so strong his faith, that old Neptune and King Eolus, with all their terrors could not appal him. He sailed from  his  native  shores,  and  landed  on  this  continent.  He  was, however, ignorant of manythings pertaining to this new country, and  government;  and  on  his  arrival,  asked  for  the  rights  and immunities  of  a  citizen.  He  was  told,  that  the  civil  rights  of hospitality to a *stranger* could be extended to him as a *friendly alien;* but not one of the rights, or immunities of a *citizen* could be his,  unless  he  were  born  again.  "*Born  again!*"  said  he,  in  a disappointed  tone  to  Columbus,  with  whom  he  had  his  first conversation on the subject. "What do you mean by being born again?" 

*Columbus.* — You must be *naturalized,* or adopted as a citizen; or, what we call *born again.* 

*A. B.* — I do not understand you. How can a man be born when he is grown? 

*Col.* — That which is born of Great Britain is British, and that which is  born  of  America  is  American.  If,  then,  you  would  be  an American citizen, you must be born of America. 

*A.  B.* — 'Born  of  America!'  You  astonish  me.  I  have  come  to America, well disposed towards the people and the country. I was once  attached  to  England,  but  I  became  attached  to  the  United States; and because of my faith and attachments I have come here; and will you not receive me into your kingdom because I could not help being born in England? 

*Col.* — Well  disposed  as I  am,  and  we  are,  to  receive  you,  most assuredly I say to you, unless you are regenerated in a court-house, and been enfranchised by and before the judges, you can never become a citizen of these United States. 

*A. B.* — Yours is an arbitrary and despotic government. What airs of sovereignty you have assumed! 

*Col.* — By  no  means.  Right,  reason,  wisdom,  policy,  and benevolence for you; as well as the safety, dignity, and happiness of  the  whole  community,  require  that  every  alien  shall  be naturalized,  or  made  a  citizen,  before  he  exercise  or  enjoy  the rights of a citizen. 

*A.  B.* — You  are  certainly  arbitrary — if  not  in  the  thing  itself,  of regeneration — in the place and manner in which it shall be done. Why, for instance, say that it must be done in a *court-house?* 

*Col.* — I will tell you; because there are the *judges,* the *records,* and the *seal* of the government. 

*A. B.* — I understand you. Well, tell me, how is a man born again? Tell me plainly and without a figure. 

*Col.* — With pleasure. You were born of your mother and of your father,  when  you  were  born  in  England;  and  you  were  born *legitimately,* according to the institutions of England. Well, then, you  were  born  *of*  England,  as  well  as  born  *in*  it;  and  were, therefore, wholly English. This was your first birth. But you have expatriated  yourself,  as  your  application  here  proves — I  say *sentimentally* you have expatriated yourself; but we must have a formal *solemn pledge* of your renunciation; and we will give you a formal  pledge  of  your  adoption.  You  must,  *ex  animo,*  in  the presence of the Judges and the Recorders, renounce all allegiance to  every  foreign  prince  and  potentate,  and  especially  to  His Majesty the King of Great Britain. 

*A.  B.* — Is  that  the  thing?  I  can,  with  all  my  heart,  renounce  all *political* allegiance to every foreign prince and government. Is that all? I have, then, no objection to that. 

*Col.* — There is this also: — You are not only to renounce all political allegiance; but you must also, from the soul, solemnly vow, in the presence of the same Judges and Recorders, that you will adopt and  submit  to  the  constitution  and  government  of  these  United States. 

*A. B.* — I can do that also. I can renounce, and I can adopt; nor do I object to the place where it shall be done. But, pray, what solemn pledge will *you give me!* 

*Col.* — So soon as you have vowed renunciation and adoption in the presence  of  the  Judges  and  Recorders,  we  will  give  you  a certificate, with a *red seal,* the *seal of the state,* attached to it; stating that you, having now been naturalized, or born according to our  institutions,  are  born  *of*  America;  and  are  now  a  son,  an adopted son, of America, And that *red* seal indicates that the blood, the best blood of this government, will be shed for you, to protect you and defend you; and that your life will, when called for, be cheerfully  given  up  for  your  mother,  *of*  whom  you  have  been politically  born;  as  it  would  have  been  for  your  own  natural political mother, of whom you were first born. 

*A. B.* — To this I must subscribe. In my mother tongue it all means that I give myself up politically to this government, and it gives itself up to me, before witnesses too. How soon, pray, after this new birth may I exercise and enjoy all the rights of a citizen? 

*Col.* — They are yours the first breath you breathe under your new mother. It is true, we have not, in these United States, any *symbol* through which a person is politically regenerated. We only ask a solemn pledge, and give one. Some nations have symbols. But we understand  that  the  moment  the  vow  is  taken,  the  person  is politically born again. And as every other child has all the rights of a child which it can exercise, so soon as it inhales the air; so have all our political children all political rights, so soon as the form of naturalization is consummated. But, remember, *not till then.* 

*A. B.* — You say some nations had their symbols. What do you mean by these? 

*Col.* — I  mean  that  the  naturalized  had  to  submit  to  some emblematic rite, by which they were symbolically detached from every  other  people,  and  introduced  among  those  who  adopted them, and whom they adopted. The Indian nations wash all whom they adopt in a running stream, and impose this task upon their females.  The  Jews  circumcised  and  washed  all  whom  they admitted to the rights of their institutions. Other customs and forms have obtained in other nations; but we regard simply the meaning of the thing, and have no symbol. 

*A. B.* — In this I feel but little interested. I wish to become a citizen of these United States; especially as I am informed I can have *no* inheritance  among  you,  nor  a  *voice*  in  the  nation,  nor  any immunity, unless I am born again. 

*Col.* — You must, then, submit to the institution; and I know that as soon as you are politically born again, you will feel more of the importance and utility of this institution than you now can; and will be just as anxious as I am to see others submit to this wise, wholesome, and benevolent institution. 

*A. B.* — As my faith brought me to your shores, and as I approve your constitution and government, I will not (now that I understand your institutions) suffer an opportunity to pass. I will direct my course to the place where I can be born again. 

I ought here to offer an apology for a phrase occurring frequently in this essay and in this dialogue. When we represent the subject of immersion as active, either in so many words or impliedly, we so far depart from that style which comports with the figure of "*being born.*" For all persons are passive in being born. So, in immersion, the subject buries not himself, raises not himself; but is buried and raised by another. So that in the act the subject is always passive. And it is of that act alone of which we thus speak. 

From  all  that  has  been  said  on  *regeneration,*  and  from  the illustration just now adduced, the following conclusions must, we think, be apparent to all: —  

***First**.* Begetting and quickening necessarily precede being born. 

***Second**.* Being born imparts no new life; but is simply *a change of state,* and introduces into *a new mode of living.* 

***Third**.*  Regeneration,  or  immersion — the  former  referring  to  the import of the act, and the latter term to the act itself — denote only the act of being born. 

***Fourth**.* God, or the Spirit of God, being the author of the whole institution, imparting to it its life and efficiency, is the *begetter,* in the fullest sense of that term. Yet, in a subordinate sense, every one skillful in the word of God, who converts another, may be said to have  begotten  him  whom  he  enlightens.  So  Paul  says,  'I  have begotten  Onesimus  in  my  bonds:' — and  'I  have  begotten  you, Corinthians, through the gospel.' 

***Fifth**.*  The  gospel  is  declared  to  be  *the  seed;* — the  power  and strength of the Holy Spirit to impart life. 

***Sixth**.* And the great argument, pertinent to our object, in this long examination  of  conversion  and  regeneration,  is  that  which  we conceive to the most apparent of all other conclusions, viz: — that remission of sins, or coming into a state of acceptance, being one of the present immunities of the Kingdom of Heaven, cannot be scripturally enjoyed by any person before immersion. As soon can a person be a citizen before he is born, or have the immunities of an American citizen while an alien; as one enjoy the privileges of a son of God before he is born again. For Jesus expressly declares, that he has not given the privilege of sons to any but those born of God.44 If, then, the present forgiveness of sins be a privilege, and a right of those under the new constitution, in the kingdom of Jesus; and if being born again, or being born of *water* and of the Spirit, is necessary  to  admission;  and  if  being  born  of  *water*  means *immersion,* as clearly proved by all witnesses; then, remission of sins cannot,  in  this  life, be constitutionally  enjoyed previous to immersion. If there be any proposition regarding any item of the Christian  institution,  which  admits  a  clearer  proof,  or  fuller illustration than this one, I have yet to learn where it may be found. 

But before we dismiss the sixth evidence, which embraces so many items, I beg leave to make a remark or two on the propriety of considering  the  term  "immersion,"  as  equivalent  to  the  term "conversion." 

"Conversion" is, on all sides, understood to be a turning to God. Not  a  thinking  favorably  of  God,  nor  a  repenting  for  former misdeeds; but an actual turning to God, in word and in deed. It is true, that no person can be said to turn to God, whose mind is not enlightened, and whose heart is not well disposed towards God. All human  actions,  not  resulting  from  previous  thought  or determination, are rather the actions of a machine, than the action of a rational being. "He that comes to God," or turns to him, "must believe that God exists, and that he is a rewarder of every one who diligently seeks him." Then he will seek and find the Lord. An "external conversion" is no conversion at all. A turning to God with the lips, while the heart is far from him, is mere pretence and mockery. But though I never thought anything else since I thought upon religion; I understand the "turning to God," taught in the New Institution, to be a coming to the Lord Jesus — not a *thinking* about doing it, nor a *repenting* that we have not done it; — but an *actual coming* to him. The question then is, Where shall we find him? Where  shall  we  meet  him?  No  where  on  earth  but  in  his institutions. "Where he records his name," there alone can he be found; for there only has he promised to be found. I affirm, then, that the first institution, in which we can meet with God, is, the institution for remission. And here it is worthy of notice, that the Apostles, in all their speeches and replies to interrogatories, never commanded an inquirer to pray, read or sing,  *as preliminary to coming; but always commanded and proclaimed immersion as the first  duty,  or  the  first  thing  to  be  done,  after  a  belief  of  the testimony.*  Hence,  neither  praying,  singing,  reading,  repenting, sorrowing, resolving, nor waiting to be better, was the converting act. Immersion *alone* was the act of turning to God. Hence, in the commission to convert the nations, the only institution mentioned after proclaiming the gospel, was the immersion of the believers, as the divinely authorized way of carrying out and completing the work.  And  from  the  day  of  Pentecost  to  the  final  *Amen*  in  the revelation of Jesus Christ, no person was said to be converted, or to turn to God, until he was buried and raised up out of the water. 

If it were not to treat this subject as one of doubtful disputation, I would say, that had there not been some act, such as immersion agreed on all hands, to be the medium of remission and the act of conversion  and  regeneration;  the  Apostles  could  not,  with  any regard to truth and consistency, have addressed the disciples as pardoned,  justified,  sanctified,  reconciled,  adopted,  and  saved persons.  If all this  had depended upon some mental  change, as faith; they could never have addressed their congregations in any other way than as the moderns do: and that is always the language of doubt and uncertainty — hoping a little, and fearing much. This mode of address and the modern compared, is proof positive, that they viewed the immersed through one medium, and we through another.  They  taught  as  the  disciples  to  consider  not  only themselves as saved persons; but all whom they saw, or knew to be immersed  into  the  Lord  Jesus.  They  saluted  every  one,  of  his coming out of the water, as *saved,* and recorded him as such. Luke writes, "The Lord added *the saved* daily to the congregation."45

Whenever a child is born into a family, it is a brother or a sister to all other children of the family; and its being born of the same parents, is the act causative and declarative of its fraternity. All is mental  and  invisible  before  coming  out  of  the  water;  and  as immersion is the first act commanded, and the first constitutional act; so it was in the commission, *the act* by which the Apostles were commanded to turn or convert those to God, who believed their testimony. In *this* sense, then, it is the converting act. No man can,  scripturally,  be  said  to  be  converted  to  God  until  he  is immersed. How  ecclesiastics  interpret  their own language is  no concern  of  ours.  We  contend  for  the  pure  speech,  and  for  the apostolic ideas attached to it. 

To resume the direct testimonies declarative of the remission of sins by immersion, we turn to the Gentiles. Peter was sent to the house of Cornelius to tell him and his family "words by which they might be saved." He tells these words. He was interrupted by the miraculous descent of the Holy Spirit. But it is to be noticed, that the testimony, to which the Holy Spirit there affixed its seal, was the following words: — "To *him* gave all the prophets witness, that every one who believes on him *shall receive remission of sins by his name.*" While speaking these words, concerning remission of sins by, or through his name, the Holy Spirit in its marvellous gifts of tongues, fell upon them. 

Many, seeing so much stress laid upon faith or belief, suppose that all blessings flow from it  *immediately.* This  is  a  great  mistake. Faith, indeed, is the principle, and the distinguishing principle of this economy: but it is only the principle of action. Hence, we find the name, or person of Christ always interposed between faith and the cure, mental or corporeal. The woman who touched the tuft of the mantle of Jesus had as much faith before as after; but though her  faith  was  the  cause  of  her  putting  forth  her  hand,  and accompanied it; *she was not cured until the touch.* That great type of Christ, the brazen serpent, cured no Israelite simply by faith. The Israelites, as soon as they were bitten, believed it would cure them. But yet they were not cured as soon as bitten; nor until *they looked* to the serpent. It was one thing to believe that looking at the serpent would cure them; and another to look at it. It was *the faith,* remotely; but, *immediately, the look,* which cured them. It was not faith in the waters of Jordan that healed the leprosy of Naaman the Syrian.  It  was  immersing  himself  in  it,  according  to  the commandment. It was not faith in the pool of Siloam that cured the blind man, whose eyes Jesus anointed with clay; it was his washing his eyes in Siloam's water. Hence, the imposition of hands, or a word, or a touch, or a shadow, or something from the persons of those anointed with the Holy Spirit, was the *immediate* cause of all the  cures  recorded  in  the  New  Testament.  It  is  true,  also,  that without faith it is impossible to be healed; for in some places Jesus could not work many miracles, because of their unbelief. It is so in all the moral remedies and cures. It is impossible to receive the remission of sins without faith. In this world of means, (however it may be in a world where there are no means) it is as impossible to receive any blessing through faith without the appointed means. *Both  are  indispensable.*  Hence,  *the  name*  of  the  Lord  Jesus  is interposed  between  faith  and  forgiveness,  justification  and sanctification,  even  where  immersion  into  that  *name*  is  not detailed. It would have been unprecedented in the annals of the world,  for  the  historian  always  to  have  recorded  all  the circumstances of the same institution, on every allusion to it; and it would have been equally so far the Apostles to have mentioned it always in the same words. Thus, in the passage before us, the *name* of  the  Lord  is  only  mentioned.  So  in  the  first  letter  to  the Corinthians, the disciples are represented as saved, as washed, as justified, sanctified *by the name* of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. The frequent interposition of the name of the Lord between faith and forgiveness, justification, sanctification, etc. is explained in a remark in James' speech in Jerusalem.46 It is the application of an ancient prophecy, concerning the conversion of the Gentiles. The Gentiles are spoken of as turning to, or seeking the Lord. But who them are thus converted? "Even all the Gentiles *upon whom* my name is called." It is, then, to those *upon whom* the name  of  the  Lord  is  called,  that  the  name  of  the  Lord communicates remission, justification, etc. 

Some captious spirits need to be reminded, that as they sometimes find forgiveness, justification, sanctification, etc. ascribed to grace, to the blood of Christ, to the name of the Lord, without an allusion to faith; so we sometimes find faith, and grace, and the blood of Christ, without an allusion to water. Now, if they have any reason and right to say, that faith is understood in the one case; we have the  same  reason  and  right  to  say,  that  water  or  immersion  is understood in the other. For their argument is, that in sundry places this matter is made plain enough. This is, also, our argument — in sundry places this matter is made plain enough. This single remark cuts off all their objections drawn from the fact, that immersion is not always found in every place where *the name* of the Lord, or *faith*  is  found connected with  forgiveness.  Neither is  grace, the blood  of  Christ,  nor  faith,  always  mentioned  with  forgiveness. When they find a passage where remission of sins is mentioned without immersion, it is weak, or unfair, in the extreme, to argue from that, that forgiveness can be enjoyed without immersion.  

***If their logic be worth anything, it will prove, that a man may be forgiven without grace, the blood of Jesus, and without faith: for we  can  find  passages,  many  passages,  where  remission,  or justification, sanctification, or some similar term, occurs, and no mention of either grace, faith, or the blood of Jesus.*** 

As this is the pith, the marrow, and fatness, of all the logic of our most ingenious opponents on this subject, I wish I could make it more emphatic than by printing it in capitals. I know some editors, some  of  our  Doctors  of  Divinity,  some  of  our  most  learned declaimers, who make this argument, which we unhesitatingly call a genuine sophism, the Alpha and the Omega of their speeches against  the  meaning,  and  indispensable  importance  of  Christian immersion. 

The New Testament would have been a curious book, if, every time *remission of sins* was mentioned or alluded to, it had been preceded by *grace, faith, the blood of Jesus, immersion, etc. etc.* But now the question comes, which, to the rational, is the emphatic question — **whether do they think, believe, teach, and practice more wisely and more safely, who think, believe, and teach,** **that grace, faith, the blood of jesus, the name of the lord, and immersion,  are  all  essential  to  immediate  pardon  and acceptance; — or they who say, that faith only, grace only, the blood of christ only, the name of the lord only — and immersion not at all**? To all men, women, and children, of common sense, this question is submitted. 

It is, however, to me admirable, that the remission of sins should be, not merely unequivocally, but so repeatedly declared through *immersion,* as it is in the apostolic writings. And here I would ask the whole thinking community, one by one, whether, if the whole race of men had been assembled on Pentecost, or in Solomon's portico,  and  had  asked  Peter  the  same  question,  which  the convicted proposed, would he, or would he not, have given them the  same  answer?  Would  he  not  have  told  the  whole  race  to reform, and be immersed for the remission of their sins? or, to reform and be *converted,* that their sins might be blotted out? — to arise and be immersed, and wash away their sins? If he would not, let them give a reason; and if they say he would, let them assign a reason why they do not go and do likewise. 

Some have objected against the "seasons of refreshment," or the comforts  of  the  Holy  Spirit  being  placed  subsequent  to "conversion,"  or  "regeneration,"  or  "immersion;"  (for  when  we speak scripturally, we must use these terms as all referring to the same thing,) because the gifts of the Holy Spirit were poured out upon the Gentiles before immersion. They see not the design of thus welcoming the Gentiles into the kingdom. They forget the comparison of the Gentiles to a returning prodigal, and his father going out to meet him, even while he was yet a good way off. God had welcomed the first fruits of the Jews into his kingdom, by a stupendous display of spiritual gifts, called *the baptism of the Holy Spirit,* before any one of the Jews had been immersed into the Lord Jesus.  And,  as  Peter  explains  this  matter  in  Cornelius's  case,  it appears that God determined to make no difference between the Jews and Gentiles in receiving them into his kingdom. Hence, says Peter, "he gave them *the same gift* which he gave to us Jews *at the beginning,*" (never since Pentecost.) Thus Peter was authorized to command those Gentiles to be immersed by the authority of the Lord, no man daring to forbid it. But these gifts of the Holy Spirit, differed  exceedingly  from  the  seasons  of  refreshment,  from  the righteousness,  peace,  and  joy  in  the  Holy  Spirit,  the  common enjoyment of all who were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of sins.47

Let it be noted here, as pertinent to our present purpose, that as the Apostle Peter was interrupted by the baptism of the Holy Spirit, when he began to speak of the forgiveness by *the name* of the Lord Jesus;  so  soon  as  he  saw  the  Lord  had  received  them,  he commanded them to be immersed by the authority of the Lord. And here I must propose another question to the learned and the unlearned. How comes it to pass, that though once and only once, it is commanded that the nations who believe should be immersed into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; and though we read of no person being immersed into this name in this way; I say, how comes it to pass, that all sects use these words without a scruple, and baptize or sprinkle in this name; when more than  once  persons  are  commanded  to  be  immersed  *for  the remission of sins,* and but few of the proclaimers can be induced to immerse for the remission of sins, though so repeatedly taught and proclaimed by the Apostles? Is one command, unsupported by a single precedent, sufficient to justify this practice of Christians; and  sundry  commands  and  precedents  from  the  same  authority insufficient  to  authorize,  or  justify  us  in  immersing  for  the remission of sins? Answer this who can; I cannot, upon any other principle than, that the tyrant Custom, who gives no account of his doings, has so decreed. 

I come now to another of the direct and positive testimonies of the Apostles, showing that immersion for the remission of sins is an institution of Jesus Christ. It is the address of Ananias to Saul: "Arise and be immersed and wash away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord." On this testimony we have not as yet descanted in this essay. It has been mentioned, but not examined. 

Paul, like the Pentecostian hearers, when convinced of the truth of the pretensions of the Messiah, asked what *he* should do. He was commanded to go into Damascus, and it should be told him there what to do. It was told him in the words now before us. But, say some, this cannot be understood literally. 

For  experiment,  then,  take  it  figuratively.  Of  what  was  it figurative?  Of  something  already  received?  Of  pardon  formerly bestowed? A figure of the past?! This is anomalous. I find one writer,  and  but  one,  who  converts  this  into  a  *commemorative* baptism, like Israel's commemorating the escape from Egypt, or Christians  commemorating  the  Lord's  death.  And,  if  I  do  not mistake, some preacher said it was a figurative expression, similar to "*This is my body!*" One, whom I pressed out of all these refuges, was candid enough to say, he really did not know what it meant; but  it  could  not  mean  that  Paul  was  to  "be  baptized  for  the remission of his sins!" 

"To  wash  away  sins"  is  a  figurative  expression.  Like  other metaphoric  expressions,  it  puts  the  resemblance  in  place  of  the proper word. It necessarily means something analogous to what is said. But we are said to be washed from our sins in, or by the blood of Christ. But even "*washed in blood*" is a figurative expression, and means something analogous to washing in water. Perhaps we may find in another expression a means of reconciling these strong metaphors. Rev. 7:14. "They have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." Here are two things equally incomprehensible — to wash garments *white* in blood, and to *wash away* sins in water! An efficacy is ascribed to water which it does not  possess;  and,  as  certainly,  an  efficacy  is  ascribed  to  blood which it does not possess. If blood can *whiten* or cleanse garments, certainly water can *wash away* sins. There is, then, a transferring of the efficacy of blood to water; and a transferring of the efficacy of water to blood. This is a plain solution of the whole matter. God has transferred, in some way, the whitening efficacy, or cleansing power of water, to blood; and the absolving or pardoning power of blood to water. This is done upon the same principle as that of accounting  faith  for  righteousness.  What  a  gracious  institution! God has opened a fountain for sin, for moral pollution. He has given it an extension far and wide as sin has spread — far and wide as water flows. Wherever water, faith, and the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are, there will be found the efficacy of the blood of Jesus. Yes, as God first gave the efficacy of water to blood, he has now given the efficacy of blood to water. This, as was said, is figurative; but it is not a figure which misleads, for the meaning is given without a figure, viz. immersion for the remission of sins. And to him that made the washing of clay from the eyes, the  washing  away  of  blindness,  it  is  competent  to  make  the immersion of the body in water efficacious to the washing away of sin *from the conscience.* 

From the conscience, I say; for there its malignity is felt; and it is only  in  releasing  the  conscience  from  guilt,  and  its consequences — fear  and  shame,  that  we  are  released  from  the dominion of sin, or washed from its pollution in this world. Thus immersion, says Peter, *saves* us, not by cleansing the body from its filth, but the conscience from its guilt; yes, immersion saves us by burying us with Christ, raising us with him, and so our consciences are purified from dead works to serve the living God. Hence our Lord  gave  so  much  importance  to  immersion  in  giving  the commission  to  convert  the  world — "*He  that  believes  and  is immersed shall be saved.*" 

But,  while viewing the  water  and blood  as made to  unite their powers, as certainly as Jesus came by water and blood, we ought to consider another testimony given to this gracious combination of powers, by Paul the Apostle: "Being sprinkled in heart from an evil conscience, and being  washed in  body  with  clear water."48  The 

application of water, the cleansing element, to the body, is made in this gracious institution to reach the conscience, as did the blood of sprinkling under the law. 

Some ask, How can water, which penetrates not the skin, reach the conscience? They boast of such an objection, as exhibiting great intellect, and good sense. But little do they think, that in so talking, they laugh at, and mock the whole Divine Economy, under the Old and New Institutions: for, I ask, did not the sacrifices, and Jewish purifications, some way reach the conscience of that people!! If they did not, it was all mere frivolity throughout. And can eating bread, and drinking wine, not influence nor affect the soul! And cannot *the breath* of one man pierce the heart of another, and so move his blood, as to make his head a fountain of tears! He, who thus objects to water, and the import of immersion, objects to the whole remedial institution, as taught by Moses and by Christ, and insults the wisdom and goodness of God in the whole scheme of salvation. And he, who objects to water, because it can only take away the filth of the flesh, ought rather to object to blood; because it rather besmears and pollutes than cleanses the body, and cannot touch the soul. But all such reasoners are foolish talkers. To submit to  God's  institution  is  our  wisdom,  and  our  happiness.  The experience of the myriads who were immersed for the remission of their sins, detailed in the Christian scriptures, to say nothing of those  immersed  in  our  times,  is  worth  more  than  volumes  of arguments from the lips and pens of those who can only regard, and venerate the traditions of their fathers; because it is presumed their fathers were wiser and more able to judge correctly, than their sons. 

But as it is not our object to quote, and expatiate upon, all the sacred  testimonies,  direct  and  allusive,  to  immersion  for  the remission of sins, we shall close the proof and illustration of this proposition with an incidental allusion to the cleansing efficacy of this  institution,  found  in  the  2d  Epistle  of  Peter.49  After 

enumerating the additions to faith necessary to secure our calling and election, of which *courage* is the first, and charity, or universal love, the last; the Apostle says, that "he who has not these things is blind, shutting his eyes, and forgetting that he was *purified from his  old  sins.*"  I  need  not  here  say,  that  this  is,  perhaps,  (and certainly  as  far  as  I  know,)  universally  understood  to  refer  to Christian  immersion.  The  "*old  sins,*"  or  "*former  sins,*"  can,  we presume,  mean  no  other  sins  than  those  washed  away  in immersion. No person has yet attempted to show that these words can import anything else. It is one of the most unequivocal, and, because incidental, one of the most decisive proofs, that, in Peter's judgment, all former sins were remitted in immersion. With Peter we began our proof of this position, and with Peter we shall end our proof of it. He first proclaimed reformation for the remission of sins;  and  in  his  last  and  farewell  letters  to  the  Christian communities,  he  reminds  them  of  that  purification  from  sin, received  in,  and  through  immersion;  and  in  the  strongest  terms cautions them against forgetting that they were so purified. 

Were any person to reason upon the simple import of the action commanded by Jesus, I think it might be made apparent from the action itself, in its two parts, *the burial and the resurrection,* that it must import every thing which we have heard the Apostles ascribe to  it.  Corruption  goes  down  into  the  grave  literally;  but  does corruption come forth out of it? Is there no change of state in the grave? Who is it that expects to come forth from the grave in the same state in which he descends into it? The first born from the dead did not; nor shall any of them who fall asleep in him. How, then, can it be, that any person buried with Christ in immersion, can  rise  with  Christ,  and  not  rise  in  a  new  state!!  Surely  the Apostle exhorts to a new life from the change of state effected in immersion. "Since, indeed, you have risen with Christ, set your affections on things above." Walk in a new life. 

Again, and in the last place here — Is a child in the same state after as before its birth? Is not its state changed? And does it not live a new life, compared with its former mode of living? As new born babes desire the milk of the breast, so let the newly regenerate desire the unadulterated milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby.  Call  immersion,  then,  a  new  birth,  a  washing  of regeneration, or a resurrection, and its meaning is the same. And when so denominated, it must import that change of state which is imported  in  putting  on  Christ,  in  being  pardoned,  justified, sanctified,  adopted,  reconciled,  saved,  which  was  the  great proposition to be proved and illustrated, and which we think, has been  proved  and  illustrated  by  the  preceding  testimonies  and reflections. 

Though no article of Christian faith, nor item of Christian practice, can, legitimately, rest upon any testimony, reasoning or authority, out of the sacred writings of the Apostles, were it only one day after their decease; yet the views and practices, of those who were the  contemporaries,  or  the  pupils,  of  the  Apostles  and  their immediate successors, may be adduced as corroborating evidence of the truths taught, and the practices enjoined, by the Apostles; and, as such, may be cited; still bearing in mind, that where the testimony of Apostles ends, Christian faith necessarily terminates. After this preliminary remark, I proceed to sustain the following proposition: —  

Proposition 11 

***All the Apostolic Fathers, as they are called; all the pupils of the Apostles; and all the ecclesiastical writers of note, of the first four Christian centuries, whose writings have come down to us; allude to, and speak of, Christian immersion, as the           "regeneration" and "remission of sins" spoken of in the New Testament.*** 

This proposition I shall sustain by the testimony of those who have examined all Christian antiquity, and by citing the words of those usually called the apostolic Fathers, and other distinguished writers of the first four hundred years. We shall first summon one whose name is familiar throughout Christendom. Whether the writing be genuine or spurious, it is on all hands admitted to be a fragment of the highest antiquity: —  

***Barnabas*** 

In  his  catholic  Epistle,  chapter  11:  says,  "Let  us  now  inquire whether  the  Lord  took  care  to  manifest  anything  beforehand, concerning water and the cross. Now, for the former of these, it is written  to  the  people  of  Israel,  how  they  shall  not  receive  that baptism  which  brings  to  forgiveness  of  sins;  but  shall  institute another to themselves that cannot. For thus saith the Prophet, "Be astonished, O Heavens! and let the earth tremble at it; because this people have done two great and wicked things: They have left me, the  fountain  of  living  waters,  and  have  digged  for  themselves broken cisterns that can hold no water. Is my holy mountain Zion, a desolate wilderness? For she shall be as a young bird when its nest is taken away." — "Consider how he hath joined both the *cross* and the *water* together. For this he saith, "*Blessed are they, who, putting their trust in the cross, descend into the water;* for they shall have their reward in due time; then, saith he, will I give it them." But as concerning the present time, he saith, "Their leaves shall not fail." Meaning thereby, that every word that shall go out of your mouth, shall through faith and charity be to the conversion and hope of many. In like manner does another Prophet speak: "And the land of Jacob was the praise of all the earth;" magnifying thereby the vessels of his Spirit. And what follows? "And there was a river running on the right hand, and beautiful trees grew up by  it;  and  he  that  shall  eat  of  them  shall  live  forever."  The signification of which is this: — *that we go down into the river full of sins and pollutions; but come up again bringing forth fruit; having in our hearts the fear and hope which are in Jesus by the Spirit:* "And  whosoever  shall  eat  of  them  shall  live  forever."  That  is, whosoever shall hearken to those that call them, and shall believe, shall live forever." 

***Clement and Hermas*** 

The former gives no testimony on the subject. The latter deposes as follows.50

In speaking of a tower built upon the water by which he signified the building of Christ's church, he thus speaks: — "Hear, therefore, why the tower is built on the waters: — Because your life is saved, and shall be saved, by water." In answer to the question, "Why did the stones come up into this tower out of the deep?" he says it was necessary for them to come up by (or *through*) water, that they might be at rest; "for they could not otherwise enter the kingdom of God; for before any one *receives the name of the Son of God,* he is liable to death; but when he receives that *seal,* he is delivered from death and assigned to life. Now, that seal is *water,* into which persons go down, liable to death, but come out of it assigned to life; for which reason to these also was the seal preached; and they made use of it, that they might enter the Kingdom of God." 

Both  Clement  and  Hermas  wrote  about  the  end  of  the  first,  or beginning of the second century. 

Hermas,  moreover,  deposes  as  follows,  in  another  work  of  his, called "The Commands of Hermas."51

"And I said to him, I have even now heard from certain teachers, and there is no other repentance besides that of *baptism,* when we go down into the water, and *receive the forgiveness of sins,* and after that we should sin no more, but live in purity. And he said to me, *Thou hast been rightly informed.*" 

Having closely and repeatedly examined the Epistles of Clement; of Polycarp, to the Philippians; of Ignatius, to the Ephesians; that to  the  Magnesians;  that  to  the  Trallians,  the  Romans,  the Philadelphians,  the  Smyrnians,  and  his  Epistle  to  Polycarp; together with the Catholic Epistle of Barnabas, and the genuine works of Hermas, I can affirm that the preceding extracts are the only passages in all these writings that speak of immersion. 

Having heard the apostolic Fathers, as they are called, depose to the views of the pupils of the Apostles, down to A. D. 140; I will summon a very learned Paidobaptist antiquarian, who can bring forward every writer and Father, down to the fifth century; and, before  we  hear  any  of  his  witnesses,  we  shall  interrogate  him concerning his own convictions after he had spent many years in rummaging all Christian antiquity: —  

***Testimony of Dr. W. Wall, Author of the History of Infant Baptism*** 

Pray, Doctor, have you examined all primitive writers from the death of John down to the fifth century? 

*W. Wall.* — I have. 

And  will  you  explicitly  avow  what  was  the  established  and universal  view  of  all  Christians,  public  and  private,  for  four hundred years from the nativity of the Messiah, on the import of the saying, (John 3:5,) "Except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God?" 

*W. Wall.* — "There is not any one Christian writer, of any antiquity in any language, but who understands it of *baptism;* and, if it be not so understood, it is difficult to give an account how a person is born of *water,* any more than born of *wood.*"52

Did  all  the  Christians, public  and  private,  and  all  the  Christian writers from Barnabas to the times of Pelagius, (419,) as far as you know, continue to use the term *regenerate* as *only* applicable to immersion? 

*W. Wall.* — "The Christians did, in all ancient times, continue the use of this name "*regeneration,*" for *baptism;* so that they *never* use the word '*regenerate,*' or '*born again,*' but they mean, or denote by it, *baptism.* And almost all the quotations which I shall bring in this book, shall be instances of it."53

Did they also  substitute for "*baptism*" and "*baptize,*" the words *renewed,  sanctified,  sealed,  enlightened,  initiated,*  as  well  as *regenerated?* 

*W. Wall.* — "For to *baptize,* they used the following words: — Most commonly,  *anagennao,*  to  regnerate;  sometimes,  *kainopoieo,*  or *anakainiozo,* to renew, frequently, *agiazo,* to sanctify. Sometimes they  call  it  *the  seal;*  and  frequently,  *illumination,*  as  it  is  also called, Heb. 6:4, and sometimes, *teliosis,* initiation."54 "St. Austin, not  less  than  a  hundred  times,  expresses  *baptized*  by  the  word *sanctified.*55

We  shall  now  see  some  of  Mr.  Wall's  witnesses;  and  I  choose rather  to  introduce  them  from  his  own  pen,  as  he  cannot  be supposed partial to the views I have presented in this essay: —  

***Justin Martyr*** 

Justin Martyr wrote about forty years after John the Apostle died, and  stands  most  conspicuous  among  the  primitive  Fathers.  He addressed  an  apology  to  the  Emperor  Antoninus  Pius.  In  this apology he narrates the *practices* of the Christians, and the reasons of  them.  Concerning  those  who  are  persuaded  and  believe  the things  which  are  taught,  and  who  promise  to  live  according  to them, he writes —  

"Then we bring them to some place where there is water, and they are *regenerated* by the same way of *regeneration* by which we were *regenerated:* for they are washed in water (*en to udati*) in the name of God the Father and Lord of all things, and of our Savior Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit; for Christ says, Unless you be regenerated  you cannot  enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; and everybody knows it is impossible for those who are once generated (or born) to enter again into their mother's womb." 

"It  was  foretold  by  Isaiah,  as  I  said,  by  what  means  they  who should repent of their sins might escape them; and was written in these words, 'Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil,' etc." 

"And we have been taught  by the Apostles this reason for this thing. Because we being ignorant of our first birth, were generated by necessity (or course of nature) and have been brought up in all customs and conversation; that we should not continue children of that  necessity  and  ignorance,  but  of  will  (or  choice)  and knowledge, and should obtain *forgiveness of the sins* in which they have lived, by water (or in water). Then is invoked over him that has a mind to be *regenerated,* the name of God the Father, etc. And this washing is called *the enlightening.*" 

As you trace the history of infant baptism, Mr. Wall, as nigh the apostolic times as possible, pray, why do you quote Justin Martyr, who never mentions it? 

*W. Wall.* — "Because his is the most ancient account of *the way of baptizing,*  next  the  scripture;  and  shows  the  plain  and  simple manner of administering it. Because it shows that the Christians of those times (many of whom lived in the days of the Apostles) used the word, '*regeneration*' (or '*being born again*') for *baptism;* and that they were taught to do so by the Apostles. And because we see by it that they understood John 3:5. of water baptism; and so did all the writers of these 400 years, **not one man excepted**." — p. 54. 

Did any of the ancients use the word *matheteueo* (to disciple) as it is used in the commission; or did they call the baptized *discipled?* 

*W. Wall.* — "Justin Martyr, in his second apology to Antoninus, uses it. His words are: — 'Several persons among us, of sixty and seventy years old, of both sexes, *who were discipled* (*matheteuio*) to Christ, in or from their childhood, do continue uncorrupted.'" — p. 54. 

So  soon  as  they  began  to  mysticize,  they  began  to  teach  that immersion *without faith,* would obtain remission of sins, and that immersion *without faith* was regeneration. Then came the debates about *original sin:* and so soon as original sin was proved, then came  the  necessity  of  infant  immersion  for  the  remission  of original  sin.  And  so  undisputed  was  the  import  of  baptism  for remission,  that  when  the  Pelagians  denied  original  sin,  pressed with difficulty, "why immerse those who have no sins?" they were pushed  to  invent  *actual  sins*  for  infants;  such  as  their  crying, peevishness,  restlessness,  etc.  on  account  of  which  sins  they supposed that infants might with propriety be immersed, though they had no original sin. 

***Tertullian*** 

Tertullian, the first who mentions infant baptism, flourished about A. D.  216.  He  writes  against  the  practice:  and  among  his  most conclusive  arguments  against  infant  immersion,  (for  then,  there was no sprinkling,) he assumes, as a fundamental principle not to be questioned, that immersion was for the remission of sins; and, this being universally conceded, he argues as follows: —  

"Our  Lord  says,  indeed,  'Do  not  forbid  them  to  come  to  me;' therefore, let them come when they are grown up — let them come when they understand — when they are instructed whither it is that they  come.  Let  them  be  made  Christians  when  they  can  know Christ.  What  need  their  *guiltless*  age  make  such  haste  to  *the forgiveness  of  sins?*  Men  will  proceed  more  warily  in  worldly goods; and he that should not have earthly goods committed to him, yet shall have heavenly! Let them know how to desire this salvation, that you may appear to have given to one that asketh." p. 74. 

***Origen*** 

Origen, though so great a visionary, is, nevertheless, a competent witness in any question of fact. And here I would again remind the reader,  that  it  is  as  witnesses  in  a  question  of  *fact,*  and  not  of *opinion,*  we  summon  these  ancients.  It  is  not  to  tell  their  own opinions, nor the reasons for them, but to depose what were the views of Christians on this institution in their times. There was no controversy on this subject for more than four hundred years, and therefore we expect only to find incidental allusions to it; but these are numerous, and of the most unquestionable character. Origen, in his homily upon Luke, says: —  

"Infants  are  baptized  for  the  forgiveness  of  their  sins.  Of  what sins? Or when have they sinned? Or how can any reason of the law, in their case, hold good, but according to that sense that we mentioned even now? (that is) none is free from pollution, though his life be but the length of one day upon the earth." 

And in another place he says, that —  

"The baptism of the church is given for the forgiveness of sins." And again —  

"If  there  were  nothing  in  infants  that  wanted  forgiveness  and mercy, the grace of baptism would be needless to them." 

In another place he says —  

"But in the *regeneration,* (or new birth,) by the *laver* (or baptism,) every one that is born again of water and the Spirit, is clear from pollution: clear (as I may venture to say) as by a glass darkly." — p. 82. 

But  now  let  me  ask  Dr.  Wall, — Do  Gregory  Nazianzen,  Basil, Ambrose,  Chrysostom,  and  St.  Austin,  concur  with  all  their predecessors in those views of regeneration and remission? 

*W. Wall.* — "Yes, exactly. I have observed, among the several names which the ancients give to *baptism,* they often, by this phrase, '*the forgiveness of sins,*' do mean the sacrament of baptism." — p. 179. And  as  for  Chrysostom,  he  expressly  says,  "In  baptism,  or  the spiritual circumcision, there is no trouble to be undergone but to throw off the load of sins, and to receive pardon for all foregoing offences." p. 182. And again; "There is no receiving or having the bequeathed inheritance before one is baptized; and none can be called *a son* till he is baptized." — p. 183. 

The  controversies  about  infant  baptism  and  original  sin  were contemporaneous; and just so soon as they decided the nature and extent of original sin, baptism for the remission of sins was given to infants because of this pollution, and defended because of the necessity of regeneration and forgiveness to salvation; and because immersion  was  universally  admitted  to  be  the  scriptural regeneration  and  remission.  In  this  way,  there  is  no  reasonable doubt, but infant baptism began; and for convenience' sake, as Dr. Wall contends, it was substituted by infant sprinkling. 

Unless we were to transcribe all the testimonies of antiquity, one by one, no greater assurance can be given, that for more than four hundred  years  after  Christ,  all  writers,  orthodox  and  heterodox, Pelagius  and  Austin  not  excepted,  concurred  in  the  preceding views. Were I to summon others — Eusebius, Dupin, Lightfoot, and Hammond, *cum multis aliis* — will depose the same. 

This proposition we will dismiss with the testimony of the most renowned of the Bishops of Africa. I extract it from a work now generally  read,  called  the  "History  of  Martyrs."  It  is  from  the account Cyprian gives of his conversion. — p. 317. 

***Cyprian*** 

"While (says he) I lay in darkness and uncertainty, I thought on what  I  had  heard  of  a  second  birth,  proposed  by  the  divine goodness; but could not comprehend how a man could receive a new life from his being immersed in water, cease to be what he was before, and still remain the same body. How, said I, can such a change be possible? How can he who is grown old in a worldly way of living strip himself of his former inclinations and inveterate habits?  Can  he,  who  has  spent  his  whole  time  in  plenty,  and indulged his appetite without restraint, ever be transformed into an example of frugality and sobriety? Or he who has always appeared in splendid apparel, stoop to the plain, simple, and unornamented dress of the common people? It is impossible for a man, who has borne the most honorable posts, ever to submit to lead a private and obscure life: or that he who was never seen in public without a crowd of attendants, and persons who endeavored to make their fortunes  by  attending  him,  should  ever  bear  to  be  alone.  This (continues he) was my way of arguing: I thought it was impossible for me to leave my former course of life, and the habits I was then engaged in, and accustomed to: but no sooner did the live-giving water  wash  the  spots  off  my  soul,  than  my  heart  received  the heavenly light of the Holy Spirit, which transformed me into a new creature; all my difficulties were cleared, my doubts dissolved, and my darkness dispelled. I was then able to do what before seemed impossible;  could  discern  that  my  former  life  was  earthly  and sinful, according to the impurity of my birth; but that my spiritual birth  gave  me  new  ideas  and  inclinations,  and  directed  all  my views to God." 

Cyprian flourished A. D. 250. 

Proposition 12 

***But even the reformed creeds, Episcopalian, Presbyterian,     Methodist, and Baptist, substantially avow the same views of immersion, though apparently afraid to carry them out in faith and practice.*** 

This proposition will be sustained by an extract from the creed of each of these sects. 

***Episcopalian*** 

The clergy are ordered, before proceeding to baptize, to make the following prayer.56

"Almighty and everlasting God, who of thy great mercy, didst save Noah and his family in the Ark from perishing by water; and also didst safely lead the children of Israel thy people through the Red sea; figuring thereby the holy baptism; and by the baptism of thy well-beloved Son Jesus Christ  in  the  river  Jordan,  didst  sanctify  the  element  of water, in the mystical washing away of sin; we beseech thee, for thine infinite  mercies, that thou  wilt mercifully look upon *these* thy *servants;* wash *them* and sanctify *them* with the Holy Ghost; that  *they* being delivered from thy wrath, may be received into the Ark of Christ's Church; and being steadfast in faith, joyful through hope, and rooted in charity, may so pass the waves of this troublesome world, that finally *they* may come to the land of everlasting life; there to reign with thee, world without end, through Jesus Christ our Lord. *Amen.*" 

After  reading  a  part  of  the  discourse  with  Nicodemus  they  are ordered to make the following exhortation.57

"Beloved, ye hear in this gospel the express words of our Savior Christ, that except a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. Whereby ye  may  perceive  the  great  necessity  of  this  sacrament, where  it  may  be  had.  Likewise  immediately  before  his ascension into heaven, (as we read in the last chapter of St. Mark's Gospel,) he gave command to his disciples, saying, Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but  he  that  believeth  not  shall  be  damned.  Which  also showeth  unto  us  the  great  benefit  we  reap  thereby.  For which cause of St. Peter, the Apostle, when, upon his first preaching of the gospel, many were pricked at the heart, and  said  to  him  and  the  rest  of  the  Apostles,  Men  and brethren, what shall we do? replied, and said unto them, Repent and be baptized every one of you, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost: for the promise is to you and your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. And with  many  other  words  exhorted  he  them,  saying,  Save yourselves from this untoward generation. For, as the same Apostle testifieth in another place, even baptism doth also now save us, (not the putting away the filth of the flesh, but the  answer  of  a  good  conscience  towards  God,)  by  the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Doubt ye not, therefore, but earnestly  believe,  that  he  will  favorably  receive  *these* present *persons,* truly repenting, and coming unto him by faith; that he will grant *them* remission of *their* sins, and bestow upon *them* the Holy Ghost; then he will give *them* the blessings of eternal life, and *make them partakers* of his everlasting kingdom." 

This, I need not add, is in accordance with the sentiments advanced in  this  essay.  What  a  pity  that  the  Episcopal  church  does  not believe and practice her own creed! 

***Presbyterian*** 

The  Presbyterian  Confession,  on  Baptism,  chap.  28:  sec.  1. declares that —  

"Baptism is a sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ, not only for the solemn admission of the party baptized into the visible church; but also to be unto him  a  sign  and  seal  of  the  covenant  of  grace,  of  his engrafting into Christ, of regeneration, of remission of sins, and of his  giving up unto  God, through Jesus Christ, to walk in newness of life: which sacrament is, by Christ's own appointment, to be continued in his church until the end of the world." 

"*A sign and seal of remission of sins!!*" This is much nigher the truth  than  this  church  seems  to  be  apprised  of.  However,  she cannot believe her own creed; for she does not believe that baptism is a sign and a seal of remission of sins, nor of regeneration in her own sense of it, to her baptized or sprinkled infants, but in paying any regard to the Scriptures, she could not say less than she has said. It is no wonder that many sectaries cannot be persuaded to think, that the scriptures mean what they say: for they are so much accustomed to say what they do not mean, that they cannot think God does mean what he says. 

***Methodist*** 

The Methodist Creed says —  

"Dearly beloved, forasmuch as all men are conceived and born in sin, (and that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and they that are in the flesh cannot please God but live in sin, committing  many  actual  transgressions:)  and  that  our Savior Christ, saith, None shall enter into the Kingdom of God, except he be regenerate and born anew of water and of  the  Holy  Ghost;  I  beseech  you  to  call  upon  God  the Father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that of his bounteous goodness  he  will  grant  to  *these  persons,*  that  which  by nature *they* cannot have; that *they* may be baptized with water and the Holy Ghost, and received into Christ's holy church, and made lively *members* of the same." 

Then it is ordained that the minister say, or repeat the following prayer: —  

"Almighty and immortal God, the aid of all that need, the helper of all that flee to thee for succor, the life of them that believes, and the resurrection of the dead: We call upon thee  for  *these  persons;*  that  *they,*  coming  to  thy  holy baptism, may receive remission of *their* sins, by spiritual regeneration. Receive *them,* O Lord, as thou hast promised by thy well beloved Son, saying, Ask, and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find, knock, and it shall be opened unto you, so give unto us that ask; let us that seek, find; open the gate unto us that knock; that *these persons* may enjoy the everlasting benediction of the heavenly washing, and may come to the eternal kingdom which thou hast promised by Christ our Lord. *Amen.*" — *Dis. p.* 105. 

Thus the Methodist Creed and Church are nearly as scriptural as the  church  from  which  they  sprang.  She  prays  for  those  to  be baptized, that in baptism they may receive the remission of sins! Does she believe what she says? 

***Baptist*** 

***Chapter* XXX. *Section* 1**.— 

"Baptism is an ordinance of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ, to be unto the party baptized a sign of his fellowship with him in his death and resurrection; of his being engrafted into him; of remission of sins, and of his giving up unto God, through Jesus Christ, to live and walk in newness of life." 

The  Baptist  follows  the  Presbyterian  church  as  servilely  as  the Methodist church follows the English hierarchy. But she avows her faith that immersion is a *sign* of remission. A sign of the past, the present, or the future! A sign accompanying! 

***The Confession of Bohemia**.*— 

"We believe that whatsoever by baptism — is in the outward ceremony signified and witnessed, all *that* doth the Lord God  perform  inwardly.  That  is,  he  washeth  away  sin, begetteth a man again, and bestoweth salvation upon him; for the bestowing of these excellent fruits was holy baptism given and granted to the church." 

***The Confession of Augsburg**.*— 

"Concerning  baptism,  they  teach  that  it  is  necessary  to salvation,  as  a  ceremony  ordained  of  Christ;  also,  by baptism the grace of God is offered." 

***The Confession of Saxony**.*— 

"I baptize thee — that is I do witness that by this dipping thy sins be washed away, and that thou art now received of the true God." 

***The Confession of Whittenberg.*—** 

**"**We believe and confess that baptism is that sea, into the bottom whereof, as the Prophet saith, God doth cast all our sins." 

***The Confession of Helvetia**.*— 

"To be baptized in the name of Christ, is to be enrolled, entered, and received into the covenant and family, and so into the inheritance of the sons of God; that is to say, to be called the sons of God, to be purged also from the filthiness of sins, and to be endued with the manifold grace of God, for to lead a new and innocent life." 

***The Confession of Sueveland**.*— 

"As  touching  baptism,  we  confess  that  it  is  the  font  of regeneration,  washeth  away  sins,  and  saveth  us.  But  all these things we do understand as St. Peter doth interpret them. 1 Peter 3:21." 

***Westminster Assembly**.*— 

"Before  baptism  the  minister  is  to  use  some  words  of instruction — showing that it is instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ;  that it is a seal of the covenant  of grace, of our engrafting  into  Christ,  and  of  our  union  with  him,  of remission of sins, regeneration, and life eternal." 

The Roman Catholic and the Greek church say, "We believe in one baptism for the remission of sins." 

Calvin makes remission the principal thing in baptism.58

"Baptism," says he, "resembles a legal instrument properly attested,  by  which  he  assures  us  that  all  our  sins  are cancelled, effaced, and obliterated, so that they will never appear in his sight, or come into his remembrance, or be imputed to us. For he commands all, who believe, to be baptized for the remission of their sins. Therefore, those who have imagined that baptism is nothing more than a mark or sign by which we profess our religion before men, as soldiers wear the insignia of their sovereign as a mark of their profession, have not considered that which was the *principal*  thing  in  baptism;  which  is  that  we  ought  to receive  it  with  this  promise — 'He  that  believeth  and  is baptized, shall be saved.'" 

"The ancient Christian church, from the highest antiquity, after the apostolic times, appears generally to have thought that baptism is absolutely necessary for all that would be saved by the grace of Jesus Christ."59

"Most of the ancients concluded that baptism was no less necessary unto salvation than faith or repentance itself."60

John Wesley, in his comment on the New Testament, (p. 350,) speaks plainer than earlier the Methodist Discipline or the Regular Baptist Confession. His words are: —  

"Baptism, administered to real penitents, is both a *means* and  a  *seal*  of  pardon.  Nor  did  God  ordinarily  in  the primitive  church  bestow  this  (pardon)  on  any,  unless through this means."  

This is almost, if not altogether, as much as we have said on the forgiveness of sins through immersion. 

May we not say, that we have sustained this last proposition to the full extent of the terms thereof? 

With the testimony of John Wesley, the last of the reformers, I close  my  list  of  human  vouchers  for  the  import  of  Christian immersion. This list I could swell greatly; for, indeed, I have been quite  disappointed  in  looking  back  into  creeds,  councils, commentators, and reformers, ancient and modern. I begin to fear that I shall be suspected to have come to the conclusions which I have  exhibited,  from  consulting  human  writings,  creeds,  and reformers. My fears are not that we, who plead for reformation may appear to have nothing *original* to offer in this reformation; that we are mere gleaners in the fields which other minds have cultivated. It is not on this account our fears are excited, for the reformation  we  plead  is  not  characterized  by  new  and  original ideas, or human inventions; but by a return to the original ideas and institutions developed in the New Institution. But we fear lest any should suspect the views offered, to be a human invention or tradition; because we have found so much countenance for them in the works of the most ancient and renowned Christian writers, and the creeds of ancient and modern reformers. We can assure our readers, however, that we have been led to these conclusions from the simple perusal, the unprejudiced and impartial examination, of the New Testament alone. And, we may add, that we are as much astonished, as any reader of this essay can be, to find such a cloud of witnesses to the truth and importance of the views offered. 

The propositions now proved, and illustrated, must convince all that  there  is  *some  connection*  between  immersion  and  the forgiveness of sins. What the connection is, may be disputed by some: but that such a connection exists, none can dispute, who acknowledge  the  New  Testament  to  contain  a  divine communication to man. With John Wesley we say, it is "to the believing the *means* and *seal* of pardon for all previous offences;" and we not only say we *think* so, but we preach it as such, and practice  it  as  such.  Those  who  think  of  any  other  connection, would do well to attempt to form clear ideas of what they mean: for we are assured there is no meaning in any other connection. To make  it  a  commemorative  sign  of  past  remission  is  an  outrage upon  all  rules  of  interpretation,  and  a  perfect  anomaly  in  all revelation of God. To make it, prospectively, the sign of a future remission, is liable to the same exceptions. Nothing remains, but that it be considered, what it is in truth — the accompanying sign of an accompanying remission; the sign and the seal, or the means and  the  seal,  of  remission  then  granted  through  the  water, connected with the blood of Jesus, by the divine appointment, and through our faith in it. 

We have heard some objections, and we can conceive of others which may be presented to *immersion for the remission of sins.* There can be objections made to any person, doctrine, sentiment, or practice, natural, moral, political, or religious, that ever existed. But notwithstanding all the objections made to every thing, there are thousands of matters and things we hold to be facts and truths indubitable.  Amongst  these  certain  and  sure  things,  not  to  be shaken, is the Christian institution. 

Objections ****

We  will  state  and  examine  some  objections  partially  noticed already; but, because they are the most common, or may become common,  we  will  bestow  upon  them  a  formal  statement  and  a formal refutation. 

***Objection* 1. — "To make the attainment and the enjoyment of *present  salvation,*  pardon,  justification,  sanctification, reconciliation,  adoption,  dependent  upon  the  contingency  of water being present, or accessible, is beneath the dignity and character of a salvation from God."** 

And  to  make  the  attainment,  and  the  enjoyment  of  present salvation,  pardon,  etc.  dependent  upon  the  contingency  of  faith being present or accessible — upon the blood of Jesus Christ being heard of, or known, is equally objectionable; — for what is faith but the belief of testimony? Or what is it in the most popular sense but something wrought in the heart, a compound of knowledge and feeling, of assent and consent? And are not both blood and faith less accessible to mankind than the element of water? How much more water than faith, or than candidates for immersion? And is there not as much power, wisdom, and goodness of God in creating water, as sin creating air, words, letters, faith, etc.? Is not water more universal than language, words, books, preachers, faith, etc.? This objection lies as much against any one means of salvation as another; nay against all means of salvation. Whenever a case shall occur of much faith and little water; or of a little faith and no water, we will repel it by other arguments than these. 

***Objection*  2. — "It  makes  void  the  value,  excellency,  and importance of both faith and grace."**  

By no means. If a man say, with Paul, we are justified by faith; does  it  follow  that  grace  is  made  void?  Or,  if  one  say  we  are justified by grace, does it make the blood of Christ of non-effect? Or, if with Paul, a man say we are justified by his blood; does it make faith, repentance, and grace of no effect? Nay, indeed, this gives to faith its proper place and its due value. It makes it the principle  of  action.  It  brings  us  to  the  water,  to  Christ,  and  to heaven. *But it is a principle of action only.* It was not Abel's faith in his head, or heart; but Abel's faith at *the altar,* which obtained such reputation. It was not Enoch's faith in principle, but Enoch's faith in his *walk with* God, which translated him to heaven. It was not Noah's faith in God's promise and threatening; but his faith exhibited in *building an ark,* which saved himself and family from the  Deluge,  and  made  him  an  heir  of  a  new  world,  an  heir  of righteousness.  It was not Abraham's faith in God's call; but his *going out* in obedience to that call, that first distinguished him as a pilgrim, and began his reputation. It was not faith in God's promise that Jericho should fall, but that faith carried out in the *blowing of rams' horns,* which laid its walls in ruins, etc. It is not our faith in God's promise of remission; but our *going down* into the water; that obtains the remission of sins. But any one may see why faith has so much praise, and is of so much value. Because, without it, Abel  would  not  have  offered  more  sacrifices  than  Cain;  Enoch would not have walked with God; Noah would not have built an ark; Abraham would not have left Ur of the Chaldees, nor offered his son upon the altar. Without it, Israel would not have passed through  the  wilderness,  nor  crossed  the  Jordan;  and  without  it, none receive the remission of their sins in immersion. And, again, we would remind the reader that, when he talks of being saved by faith, he should bear in mind that grace is not lost sight of; nor blood, nor water, nor reformation, discarded. 

We enter the kingdom of nature by being born of the flesh. We enter the kingdom of heaven, or come under the reign of Jesus Christ, in this life, by being born of water, and the Spirit. We enter the kingdom of eternal glory by being born again from the earth, and neither by faith, nor the first regeneration. Neither by faith, nor baptism; but by being counted worthy of the resurrection of the just. "I was hungry, and you fed me." Not because you believed, or were born of water; but because "I was hungry, and yet fed me," etc. 

There are three births, three kingdoms, and three salvations. One from the womb of our first mother, one from the water, and one from the grave. We enter a new world on, and not before, each birth. The present animal life, at the first birth; the spiritual, or the life of God in our souls, at the second birth; and the life eternal in the presence of God, at the third birth. And he who dreams of entering the second kingdom, or coming under the dominion of Jesus, without the second birth, may, to complete his error, dream of entering the kingdom of glory without a resurrection from the dead. 

Grace precedes all these births — shines in all the kingdoms; but will be glorified in the third. Sense is the principle of action in the first kingdom; faith, in the second; and sight spiritual, in the third. The first salvation is that of the body from the dangers and ills of life, and God is thus "the Savior of all men." The second salvation is that of the soul from sin. The third is that of both soul and body united,  delivered  from  moral  and  natural  corruption,  and introduced into the presence of God, when God shall be all in all. 

***Objection* 3. — "It is so uncharitable to the Paidobaptists!"**  

And how uncharitable are the Paidobaptists to the Jews, Turks, and Pagans!!  Will  they  promise  present  salvation  from  the  guilt, pollution, and dominion of sin, with the well grounded hope of heaven, to Jews, Turks, Pagans, or even Roman Catholics? Or will the Roman Catholics to them!! How uncharitable are they who cry "uncharitable"  to  us!  Infants,  idiots,  deaf,  and  dumb  persons, innocent Pagans wherever they can be found, with all the pious Paidobaptists, we commend to the mercy of God. But such of them as wilfully *despise* this salvation, and who, having the opportunity to be immersed for the remission of their sins, wilfully *despise* or refuse, we have as little hope for them, as they have for all who refuse  salvation  *on  their  own  terms  of  the  gospel.*  While  they inveigh against us for laying a scriptural and natural stress upon immersion,  do  we  not  see  that  they  lay  as  great,  though  an unscriptural and irrational stress, upon their baptism or sprinkling; so much so as to give it *without faith,* even to infants, so soon as they are born of the flesh? 

***Objection*  4. — "But  do  not  many  of  them  enjoy  the  present salvation of God?"** 

How far they may be happy in the peace of God, and the hope of heaven, I presume not to say. And we know so much of human nature as to say, that he that *imagines* himself pardoned, will feel as happy as he that is really so. But one thing we do know, that none can *rationally,* and with *certainty* enjoy the peace of God, and the hope of heaven, but they who intelligently, and in full faith are born of water, or immersed for the remission of their sins. And as the  testimony of God, and not conceit, imagination,  nor our reasoning upon what passes in our minds, is the ground of our certainty, we see and feel, that we have an assurance which they cannot  have.  And  we  have  this  advantage  over  them;  we  once stood upon their ground, but their hopes, felt their assurance; but they have not stood upon our ground, nor felt assurance. Moreover, the experience of the first converts shows the difference between their  immersion,  and  the  immersion,  or  sprinklings,  of  modern gospels. 

***Objection* 5. — "This has been so long concealed from the people, and so lately brought to our view, that we cannot acquiesce in it."** 

This  objection  would  have  made  unavailing  every  attempt  at reformation,  or  illumination,  of  the  mind,  or  change  in  the condition and enjoyments of society, ever attempted. Besides, do not  the  experience  of  all  the  religious — the  observation  of  the intelligent — the  practical  result  of  all  creeds,  reformations,  and improvements — and  the  expectations,  and  longings  of  society, warrant the conclusion that either some new revelation, or some new development of the revelation of God, must be made, before the hopes and expectations of all true Christians can be realized, or Christianity save and reform the nations of this world? We want the old gospel back, and sustained by the ancient order of things: and this alone by the blessing of the Divine Spirit, is all that we do want, or can expect, to reform and save the world. And if this gospel, as proclaimed and enforced on Pentecost, cannot do this, vain are the hopes, and disappointed must be the expectations of the so called Christian world. 

Recapitulation ****

As Christian faith rests upon, and Christian practice proceeds from, *the testimony of God,* and not from the reasonings of men; — I will, in  this  recapitulation,  only  call  up  the  evidences  on  one  single proposition, assumed, sustained, and illustrated in the preceding pages;  that  that  is  the  *ninth  proposition,*  as  sustained  by  the apostolic  testimony.  We  wish  to  leave  before  the  mind  of  the diligent  reader  the  great  importance  attached  to  Christian immersion,  as  presented  in  the  Evangelists,  the  Acts,  and  the Epistles. 

1. __*In the Evangelists* — it is called *the forgiveness of sins*__*.* Matthew and Mark introduce the Messiah in his own person in giving the commission. Luke does not. Matthew presents Jesus, saying, "Go, convert the nations, immersing them into the name of the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things which I have commanded you." This, of course, in order to salvation. Mark presents him saying, "Go into all the world, proclaim the glad tidings to the whole creation; and he who believes, and is immersed,  shall  be  saved;  but  he  who  believes  not,  shall  be condemned." Luke, however, does not introduce the Lord in his own  person  in  giving  the  charge;  but  records  it,  in  his  own conception of it, in the following words: — That "reformation and forgiveness of sins should be announced in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." No person, we presume, will question but that  Luke  thus  records  the  commission; — and,  if  so,  then  it  is indisputable, that as Luke neither mentions faith nor immersion, he substitutes for them the received import of both, when and where he  wrote.  Metonymically  he  places  repentance,  or  rather *reformation,*  for  faith;  and  *remission  of  sins,*  for  immersion.  In Luke's  acceptation  and  time  forgiveness  of  sins  stood  for immersion, and reformation for faith — the effect for the means or cause. The only reference to the commission found in John, occurs 20: 21. "As the Father has sent me, so send I you: — whose sins soever you remit, are remitted to them; and whose sins soever you retain are retained." Here is neither faith, repentance, nor baptism; but  the  object,  *remission  of  sins,*  is  literally  proposed.  In  the commission, salvation is attached by the Lord Jesus to faith and immersion into his name. He that believes and is immersed, shall be saved. Thus immersion is taught in the testimonies of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. 
2. ***In the Acts of the Apostles*** — Sermon 1, Peter says, "Reform and be immersed, every one of you, in the name of the Lord Jesus, for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." Sermon 2, he says, "Reform and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out; that seasons of refreshment from the presence of the Lord may come, and that he may send Jesus," etc. In the same discourse, he says,  "God having raised up his Son Jesus, has sent him to bless you, every one of you, turning from his iniquities." In his 3d Sermon, recorded Acts 10:1-48 : he says, "To him all the Prophets bear witness, that every one who believes in him shall receive remission of sins *by his name.*" Paul at Antioch, in  Pisidia,  declares,  that  through  Jesus  was  proclaimed  the remission of sins; and by him all that believe are justified from all things. Ananias commanded Paul to arise and be immersed, and to wash away his sins, calling upon the name of the Lord. Thus it is spoken of in the acts of the Apostles. 
2. ***In the Epistles**.* — The Romans are said to have been immersed into Christ Jesus — into his death; to have been buried with him, and consequently to have risen with him, and to walk in a new life. The Corinthians are said to have been washed, justified, and sanctified by the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God. The Galatians "were immersed into Christ, and had put him on." The Ephesians were married to Christ, by immersion, as brides were wont to be washed in order to their nuptials. The assembly of the disciples, called *the congregation of the Lord,* making the bride of Christ, were said to be *cleansed* by *the bath of water* and *the word.* The Colossians were *buried with Christ, raised with him,* and are said to have been *forgiven all trespasses,* when they were raised with him, where their resurrection with Jesus and their having all sins forgiven are connected.61 All the saints are said to be saved by 

   immersion, or, "the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit."62 The believing Jews had their hearts sprinkled 

from an evil conscience, and their bodies washed with clean water, or water which made clean. Peter taught all the saints in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, that the water of baptism saved them, as water of the deluge saved Noah in the ark; and that in immersion a person was purged from all his former sins. And John  the  Apostle  represents  the  saved  as  having  "washed  their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb," and all the baptized little children as "having their sins forgiven." Such are the evidences found in the Epistles. How numerous! how clear! and how unequivocal! Are we not, then, warranted to say, Except a man be regenerated of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God? and that all who, believing, are immersed for the remission of their sins, have the remission of their sins in and through immersion? 

Conclusion ****

A word to the regenerated. — You have experienced the truth of the promise; and being introduced by that promise, you have become like Isaac, children of promise. You heard the testimony of God concerning Jesus of Nazareth, and you believed it. You were, in consequence of your faith, so disposed towards the person of Jesus, as to be willing to put yourselves under his guidance. This faith, and this will, brought you to the water. You were not ashamed, nor afraid  to  confess  him  before  men.  You  solemnly  declared  you regarded  him  as  God's  only  Son,  and  the  Savior  of  men.  You vowed allegiance to him. Down into the water you were led. Then the name of the Holy One upon your faith, and upon your person, was pronounced. You were then buried in the water under that name. It closed itself upon you. In its womb you were concealed. Into the Lord, as in the water, you were immersed. But in the water you continued not. Of it you were born, and from it you came forth,  raised  with  Jesus,  and  rising  in  his  strength.  There  your consciences were released; for there your old sins were washed away. And although you received not the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which confirmed the testimony of the first disciples, you felt the powers  of  the  world  to  come,  were  enlightened,  and  tasted  the bounty of God: for seasons of refreshment from the presence of God  came  upon  you.  Your  hearts  were  sprinkled  from  evil consciences,  when  your  bodies  were  washed  in  the  cleansing water. Then into the kingdom of Jesus you entered. The King of righteousness, of peace, and joy, extended his sceptre over you, and sanctified in state, and in your whole person, you rejoiced in the Lord with joy unspeakable and full of glory. Being washed, you  were  sanctified,  as  well  as  acquitted.  And  now  you  find yourselves under the great Advocate, so that sin cannot lord it over you; for you always look to the great Advocate to intercede for you; and thus, if sin should overtake you, you confess and forsake it, and always find mercy. Adopted thus into the family of God, you have not only received the name, the rank, and the dignity; but also the spirit of a son of God, and find, as such, that you are kings, priests, and heirs of God. You now feel that all things are yours, because  you  are  Christ's;  and  Christ  is  God's.  The  hope  of  the coming  regeneration  of  the  heavens  and  the  earth,  at  the resurrection  of  the  just,  animates  you.  You  look  for  the redemption, the adoption of your bodies, and their transfiguration. For  this  reason,  you  purify  yourselves  even  as  he  is  pure.  Be zealous, then, children of God; publish the excellencies of him, who has called you into this marvellous light and bliss. Be diligent, that you may receive the crown that never fades, and that you may eat of the tree of life, which grows in the midst of the Paradise of God.  If  you suffer  with  Jesus,  you  will reign  with  him.  If  you should  deny  him,  he  will  deny  you.  Add,  then,  to  your  faith, courage, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, and universal  benevolence;  for  if  you  continue  in  these  things  and abound, you shall not be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. But should you be deficient in these things, your light will be obscured, and a forgetfulness that you have been purified from your old sins, will come upon you. Do, then, brethren, labor to make your calling and election sure; for thus practising, you shall never fall; but shall have an easy and abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 

A word to the unregenerate. — Amongst you are sundry classes of character. Some of you who believe the gospel, and are changed in heart, quickened by the Spirit, are not generally ranked among the unregenerate. In the popular sense of this term you are regenerate. But we use it in its scriptural acceptation. Like Nicodemus, and like Joseph of Arimathea, you believe in Jesus, and are willing to take lessons from him in the chambers. You have confidence in his mission, respect and venerate, and even love his person; and would desire to be under his government. Marvel not that I say to you, *You must be born again.* Pious as you are supposed to be, and as you may think yourselves to be, unless you are born again, you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. Cornelius and his family were as devout and pious as any of you. "He feared God, gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God continually." Yet, mark it well, I beseech you, it was necessary "*to tell him words* by which himself and his  house *might  be saved.*" These words were told him: he believed them, and received the Holy Spirit, yet still he must be born again. For a person cannot be said to be born again *of anything which he receives;* and still less of miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit. He was immersed, and into the Kingdom of God he came. He was then saved. You need not ask, how or why these things are so. Do as Cornelius did, and then you will think of it in another light — then you would not for the world be unregenerate. To have the pledge, the promise, and seal of God, of the remission of all your sins, to be adopted into his family, and to receive the spirit of a son of God, be assured, my pious friends, are matters of no  every  day  occurrence;  and  when  you  feel  yourselves constitutionally  invested  with  all  these  blessings,  in  God's  own way,  you will say, that "his ways are not as our ways, nor his thoughts as our thoughts; for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are his ways higher than our ways, and his thoughts than our thoughts." It is hard to make a slave feel and act as a freeman. As difficult, we often find it, to make the unregenerate feel and know the value and importance of regeneration. But the regenerate would not be unregenerate for the universe. 

God  has  one  way  of  bestowing  every  thing.  We  cannot  gather grapes off thorns, nor figs off thistles. The reason is, there they do not grow. We can tell no other reason why they cannot grow there, but that they do not grow there. We cannot have any blessing, but in God's own way of giving it. We cannot find wool save on the back of the sheep, nor silk save from the worm which spins it from itself. Corn and wheat cannot be obtained save from the plants which yield them. Without the plant, we cannot have the fruit. This is the economy of the whole material system. And in the world of spirits, and spiritual influences, is it not the same? Moral law is as unchangeable as the laws of nature. Moral means and ends are as inseparable as natural means and ends. God cannot bestow grace upon the proud, and cannot withhold it from the humble. He does not do it, and that is enough. He could shower down wheat and corn, and give us rivers of milk and wine, were it a question of mere  power.  But  taking  all  together,  his  wisdom,  power  and goodness, he cannot do it. So neither can he give us faith without testimony, hope without a promise, love without an amiable object, peace without purity, nor heaven without holiness. He cannot give to the unborn infant the light of the sun, the vivacity which the air imparts, nor the agility and activity which liberty bestows. He does not do it, and, therefore, we say, he cannot do it. Neither can he bestow the blessings of the Reign of Heaven upon those, who are the children of disobedience. 

I know how reluctant men are to submit to God's government; and yet they must all bow to it at last. "To Jesus every knee shall bow, and to him every tongue confess." But they will object to bowing *now,* and torture invention for excuses. They will tell me, all that I said is true of natural and moral means and ends; but immersion is not  a  moral  means,  because  God  forgave  sins  and  saved  men before immersion was appointed. "It is a *positive,* and not a *moral* institution."  And  is  there  no  moral  influence  connected  with positive institutions? A  *written*  law is  a positive institution:  for moral law existed before written law. But because it has become a positive  institution,  has  its  moral  power  ceased?  *The  moral influence  of  all  positive  institutions  is  God's*  **will**  expressed  in them. And it matters not, whether it be the *eating* or *not eating* of an apple, the building of an altar, or the building it with, or without the aid of iron tools; the offering of a kid, a lamb, a bullock, or a pigeon:  it  is  just  as  morally  binding,  and  has  the  same  moral influence, as "You shall honor your father and mother;" or "You shall not kill." It is **the will of god** in any institution, which gives it all its moral and physical power. No man could now be pardoned as Abel was — as Enoch was — as David was — as the thief upon the cross  was.  These  all  lived  before  the  *second*  will  of  God  was declared. He took away "*the first will,*" says Paul, "that he might establish the *second will,*" by which we are sanctified. We are not pardoned as were the Jews or the patriarchs. It was not till Jesus was buried and rose again, that an acceptable offering for sin was presented in the heavens. By one offering up of himself, he has perfected the conscience of the immersed or sanctified. Since his oblation, a new institution for remission has been appointed. You need  not  flatter  yourselves,  that  God  will  save  or  pardon  you except for Christ's sake; and if his name is not assumed by you, if you have not put him on, if you have not come under his advocacy, you have not the name of Christ to plead, nor his intercession on your  behalf — and  therefore,  for  Christ's  sake  you  cannot  be forgiven.  Could  Abel,  Enoch,  Noah,  Abraham,  Moses,  Aaron, think you, if living now — could they, I ask, find forgiveness as the altar? And will you imagine, that he, who honored every institution by  Moses,  by  connecting  rewards  and  punishments  with  the obedience or disobedience of his commands, be less jealous for the honor of the institution of his Son? And will that Son who for no other purpose than to honor his Father's institution, was immersed in the Jordan, bestow pardon or salvation upon any, who refuse to honor him, and him that sent him? He has been graciously pleased to  adapt  means  to  ends. He has  commanded immersion for the remission  of  sins;  and,  think  you,  that  he  will  change  his institutions, because of your stubborn or intractable dispositions? As well, as reasonably might you pray for loaves from heaven, or manna, because Israel ate it in the desert; as to pray for pardon, while you refuse the remission of sins by immersion. 

Demur not because of the simplicity of the thing. Remember how simple was the eating of the fruit of that tree, "whose mortal taste brought death into the world, and all our woe." How simple was the rod in the hand of Moses, when stretched over Egypt and the Red Sea? How simple was looking at the brazen serpent? And how simple  are  God's  institutions?  How  simple  the  aliments  of nature; — the poisons  too,  and their remedies? Where the  will of God is, there is omnipotence. It was simple to speak the universe into existence. But God's will gives efficacy to every thing. And obedience ever was, and ever will be the happiness of man. It is the happiness of heaven. It is God's philanthropy which has given us something  to  obey.  To  the  angels  who  sinned  he  has  given  no command.  It  was  gracious  to  give  us  a  command  to  live — a command to reform — a command to be born again — to live forever. Remember light and life first came by obedience. If God's voice had not been obeyed, the water would not have brought forth the earth,  nor  would  the  sun  have  blessed  it  with  his  rays.  The obedience of law was goodness and mercy; but the obedience of faith is favor, and life, and glory everlasting. None to whom this gospel is announced will perish, except those who know not God, and obey not the gospel of his Son. Kiss, then, the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish for ever. 

To the unregenerate of all classes, whose education and prejudices compel them to assent to the testimony of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, Peter, James, and Jude. — You own the mission of Jesus from the bosom of the Eternal — and that is *all* you do! Each of you is living without God, and without hope in the world — aliens from the family of God — of various ranks and grades among men; but all involved in one condemnation, because light  has come into the world, and you love darkness, and the works of darkness, rather than  light.  To  live  without  hope  is  bad  enough;  but  to  live  in constant dread of the vengeance of Heaven, is still worse. But do you not tremble at the word of God? 

If you can be saved here, or hereafter, then there is no meaning in language,  no  pain  in  the  universe,  no  truth  in  God — death,  the grave, and destruction have no meaning. The frowns of Heaven are all smiles, if you perish not in your ways. 

But you purpose to bow to Jesus, and to throw yourselves upon his mercy at last. Impious thought! When you have given the strength of your intellect, the vigor of your constitution, the warmth of your affections, the best energies of your life, to the world, the flesh and the devil; you will stretch out your palsied hands and turn your dim eyes to the Lord and say, "Lord, have mercy upon me!" The first fruits, and fatlings of the devil, the lame and the blind for God, is the purpose of your heart; and the best resolution you can form! 

The thief upon the cross, had he done so, could not have found mercy. It is one thing to have known the way of salvation, assented to it, and to have in deliberate resolution rejected it for the present, with a promise of obeying it at some future period; and to have never known it, or assented to it, to the end of life. Promise not, then, to yourselves, what has never happened to others. The devil has always said, "You may give *to morrow* to the Lord — only give to me *to-day.*" This has been all that he has asked, and this is what you are disposed to give. Promise not *to-morrow* to the Lord, for you will be still less disposed to give it when it comes; and the Lord has not asked you for *to-morrow.* He says, **to-day**, when you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts. But you say, you are willing to come to the Lord *to day* if you knew the way, or if you were  *prepared!*  Well,  what  does  the  Lord  require  of  you  as *preparation?* He once said, "Let the wicked man forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God for he will abundantly pardon." He says also, "Draw nigh to me, and I will draw nigh to you;" "Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you men of two souls;" "Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings;" "Reform and be converted;" "Turn to the Lord;" "Be immersed for the remission of your sins;" and "Submit to the government of Jesus." "What! just as I am!" Pray, how are you? Have you such a persuasion in your heart of the mission of Jesus, as God's own Son, and the only Savior; and have you so much confidence in his personal character, as to be willing to surrender yourself to him for the present and future — for time and eternity? "I have," you say. As one that has heard his voice,  I  say,  then,  Come  and  be  regenerated,  and  seasons  of refreshment from the Lord will come to you. 

"But I thought I ought to feel like a Christian first, and to have the experience of a Christian before I came to the Lord." Indeed! Did the  Lord  tell  you  so?  "His  ministers  taught  me  so."  It  is  hard knowing  who  are  his  ministers  now-a-days.  His  *commissioned* ministers taught you not so. They were not taught to say so. The Master  knew  that  to  wait  for  health  before  we  went  to  the physician — to seek for warmth before we approached the fire — to wait  till  we  ceased  to  be  hungry  before  we  approached  the table — was  not  reasonable.  And  therefore  he  never  asked,  as  he never  expected,  any  one  to  feel  like  a  Christian  before  he  was immersed and began to live like a Christian. None but the citizens of any country can experience the good or evil of the government which presides over it. None but the married can experience the conjugal relation and feelings. None but sons and daughters can have the experience of sons and daughters; and none but those who obey the gospel can experience the sweets of obedience. I need not add, that none but the disobedient can experience the pains, the fears, and terrors of the Lord — the shame and remorse which are the first fruits of the anguish and misery, which await them in another world. As the disobedient, who stumble at the word, have the first fruits of the awful destruction from the presence of the Lord which awaits  them;  so  the  disobedient  have  the  first  fruits  of  the Spirit — the salvation of their souls, as an earnest of the salvation to be revealed at the coming of the Lord. 

And now let me ask all the unregenerate, What do you propose to yourselves by either delaying or refusing to come to the Lord? Will delaying  have  any  tendency  to  fit  you  or  prepare  you  for  his salvation?  Will  your  lusts  have  less  power,  or  sin  have  less dominion  over  you,  by  continuing  under  their  control?  Has  the intoxicating cup, by indulgence, diminished a taste for it? Has the avarice of the miser been weakened, or cured, by yielding to it? Has any propensity been destroyed by gratifying it, in any other way  than  as  it  destroyed  the  animal  system?  Can  you,  then, promise yourselves that, by continuing in disobedience, you will love obedience, and be more inclined to submit when you have longer resisted the Spirit of God! Presume not on the mercy of God, but in the way that mercy flows. Grace has its channels, as the waters have their courses; and its path, as the lightning of the clouds. Each has its law, as fixed as the throne of God; and think not God will work a miracle for your salvation. 

Think you that the family of Noah could have been saved, if they had refused to enter into the Ark? Could the first born of Israel have escaped the destroying angel, but in houses sprinkled with blood? or could Israel have escaped the wrath of Pharaoh, but by being immersed into Moses in the cloud and in the sea? These things  are  written  for  our  admonition,  upon  whom  the consummation  of  past  ages  has  come.  Arise,  then,  and  be immersed and wash away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord. The *many* *who refuse grace* will neither prove you wise nor safe in disobedience. 

- Multitudes are no mark  

`  `That you will right be found;    A few were saved in the Ark,    For many millions drown'd.    Obey the gospel call,  

`  `And enter while you may;  

`  `Christ's flock have long been small,    Yet none are safe but they."  

***Effects of Modern Christianity63*** 

Our greatest objection to the systems which we oppose, is their impotency  on  the  heart.  Alas!  what  multitudes  of  prayerless, saintless, Christless, joyless hearts, have crowded Christianity out of the congregations  by their experiences before baptism! They seem to have had all their religion before they professed it. They can  relate  no  experience  since  baptism,  comparable  to  that professed before the "mutual pledge" was tendered and received. 

It was the indubitable proofs of the superabundance of this fruit, which caused me first to suspect the far-famed tree of evangelical orthodoxy.  That  cold-heartedness — that  stiff  and  mercenary formality — that tithing of mint, anise, and dill — that negligence of mercy, justice, truth, and the love of God, which stalked through the communions of sectarian altars — that apathy and indifference about  "*thus  saith  the  Lord*" — that  zeal  for  human prescriptions — and, above all, that willing ignorance of the sayings and doings of Jesus Christ and his apostles, which so generally appeared, first of all created, fostered, and matured my distrust in the reformed systems of evangelical sectaries. Communion, with me, was communion of kindred souls, immersed into one God, that celestial magnet which turns our aspirations and adorations to him who washed us from our sins in his own blood, and made us kings and priests to God. 

To sit in the same pew; to gather round the same pulpit; to put our names to the same covenant, or subscription list: to contribute for a weekly sermon; to lisp the same opinions, extracted from the same creed,  always  appeared  to  me  unworthy  bonds  of  union  or communion, and therefore my soul abhorred them as substitutes for the love of God shed abroad in the heart, for the communion of the Holy Spirit. "If a man would give all the substance of his house as a substitute for love, it should be utterly contemned." 

The  Divine  Philosopher  preached  reformation  by  addressing himself  to  the  *heart.*  We  begin  with  the  heart.  "Make  the  tree good," and then good fruit may be expected. But this appears to be the error of all sects in a greater or less degree; they set about *mending* the heart, as preliminary to that which alone can *create a new  heart.*  Jesus  gives  us  the  philosophy  of  his  scheme  in  an address to a sinner of that time — "Your sins," says he, "are forgiven you: go, and sin no more." He first changes the sinner's state, not external but internal, and then says, "*Go, and sin no more.*" He frankly forgave the debt. The sinner loved him. 

There  was  much  of  this  philosophy  in  question,  "*Who  loves most* — he  that  was  forgiven  five  hundred  pence,  or  he  that  was forgiven fifty? How much does he love who is not forgiven at all?" Aye, that question brings us onward a little to the reason why the first act of obedience to Jesus Christ should be baptism into his name, and that for the remission of sins. 

But now we speak of the exercises of the heart. While any man believes the words of Jesus, "Out of the heart proceed the actions which defile the man," he can never lose sight of the heart, as the object on which all evangelical arguments are to terminate, and as the *fons et principium,* the fountain and origin, of all piety and humanity. 

Once for all, let it be distinctly noted, that we appreciate nothing in religion which tends not directly and immediately, proximately and remotely, to the purification and perfection of the heart. Paul acts the philosopher fully once, and, if we recollect right, but once, in all his writings upon this subject. It has been for many years a favorite topic with me. It is in his first epistle to Timothy — "Now the end of the commandment is love out of a pure heart — out of a good conscience — out of faith unfeigned." Faith unfeigned brings a person to remission, or to a good conscience; a good conscience precedes, in the order of nature, a pure heart; and that is the only soil in which love, that plant of celestial origin, can grow. This is our philosophy of Christianity — of the gospel. And thus it is the wisdom and power of God to salvation. We proceed upon these as our  axiomata  in  all  our  reasonings,  preachings,  writings — 1st. unfeigned faith; 2d. a good conscience; 3d. a pure heart; 4th. love. The  testimony  of  God,  apprehended,  produces  unfeigned  or genuine  faith;  faith  obeyed,  produces  a  good  conscience.  This Peter  defines  to  be  the  use  of  baptism,  the  answer  of  a  good conscience.  This  produces  a  pure  heart,  and  then  the consummation is love — love to God and man. 

Paul's  order  or  arrangement  is  adopted  by  us  as  infallible. Testimony — faith  unfeigned — remission,  or  a  good  conscience — a pure  heart — love.  Preaching,  praying,  singing,  commemorating, meditating, all issue here. "Happy the pure in heart, for they shall see God." 

***Immersion Not a Mere Bodily Act*** 

Views of baptism, as a mere external and bodily act, exact a very injurious  influence  on  the  understanding  and  practice  of  men. Hence,  many  ascribe  to  it  so  little  importance  in  the  Christian economy. "Bodily exercise," says Paul, "profits little." We have been taught to regard immersion in water, into the name of the Father,  the  Son,  and  the  Holy  Spirit,  as  an  act  of  the  whole man; — body, soul, and Spirit. The soul of the intelligent subject is as fully immersed *into the Lord Jesus,* as his body is immersed *in the water.* His soul rises with the Lord Jesus, as his body rises out of the water; and into one spirit with all the family of God is he immersed.  It  is  not  like  circumcising  a  Hebrew  infant  or proselyting to Moses a Gentile adult. — The candidate believing in the person, mission, and character of the Son of God, and willing to submit to him, immediately, upon recognizing him, hastens to be buried with the Lord, and to rise with him, not corporeally but spiritually, with his whole soul. 

Reader, be admonished how you speak of bodily acts in obedience to divine institutions. Remember Eve, Adam, and all transgressors on the one hand. Remember Abel, Noah, Enoch, Moses, Abraham, down to the harlot Rahab, on the other; and be cautious how you speak of bodily acts! Rather remember the sacrifice of a body on mount Calvary, and talk not lightly of bodily acts. There is no such things as outward bodily acts in the Christian institution; and less than in all others, in the act of immersion. Then it is that the spirit, soul, and body of man become one with the Lord. Then it is that the power of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, come upon us. Then it is that we are enrolled among the children of God, and enter the ark, which will, if we abide in it, transport us to the Mount of God. 

***Justification Ascribed to Seven Causes*** 

In examining the New Testament, we find that a man is said to be "***justified  by  faith**,*"  Rom.  5:1;  Gal.  2:16;  Gal.  3:24.  "***Justified freely  by  his  grace**,*"  Rom.  3:24;  Titus  3:7.  "***Justified  by  his blood**,*"  Rom.  5:9.  "***Justified  by  works**,*"  James  2:21;  James 2:24-25. "***Justified in or by the name of the Lord Jesus,***" 1 Cor. 6:11. "***Justified by Christ**,*" Gal. 2:16. "***Justified by knowledge**,*" Is. 53:11. "It is God that justifies," Rom. 8:33, viz: by these *seven* means — by Christ, his name, his blood, by knowledge, grace, faith, and  by  works.  Are  these  all  literal?  Is  there  no  room  for interpretation here? He that selects *faith* out of *seven* must either act arbitrarily or show his reason; but the reason does not appear in the text. He must reason it out; he must infer it. Why, then, assume that faith *alone* is the reason of our justification? Why not assume that the *name* of the Lord alone is the great matter, seeing his name "is the only name given under heaven by which any man can be saved;" and men "who believe receive *the remission of sins by his name:*"64 and especially, because the name of Jesus, or of the Lord, is more frequently mentioned in the New Testament, in reference to all spiritual blessings, than anything else!! Call all these *causes,* or *means* of justification, and what then? We have the grace of God as the *moving* cause, Jesus Christ for the *efficient* cause, his blood  the  *procuring*  cause,  knowledge  the  *disposing*  cause,  the name of the Lord the *immediate* cause, faith the *formal* cause, and works for the *concurring* cause. For example: a gentleman on the sea shore descries the wreck of a vessel at some distance from land, driving out into the ocean, and covered with a miserable and perishing  sea-drenched  crew.  Moved  by  pure  philanthropy,  he sends his son in a boat to save them. When the boat arrives at the wreck, he invites them in, unto this condition, that they submit to his guidance. A number of the crew stretch out their arms, and seizing the boat with their hands, spring into it, take hold of the oars, and row to  land, while some, from  cowardice, and others because  of  some  difficulty  in  coming  at  the  boat,  wait  the expectation of a second trip; but before it is returned, the wreck went to pieces, and they all perished. The *moving* cause of their salvation who escaped was the good will of the gentleman on the shore; the son who took the boat, was the *efficient* cause; the boat itself,  the  *procuring*  cause;  the  knowledge  of  their  perishing condition and his invitation, the *disposing* cause; the seizing the boat with their hands, and springing into it, the *immediate* cause; their  consenting  to  his  condition,  the  *formal*  cause;  and  their rowing to shore, under the guidance of his son, was the *concurring* cause of their salvation. — Thus men are justified or saved by grace, by Christ, by his blood, by faith, by knowledge, by the name of the Lord, and by works. But of the *seven* causes, *three* of which are purely  instrumental,  why  choose  *one*  of  the  instrumental,  and emphasize  upon  it  as  the  justifying  or  saving  cause,  to  the exclusion of, or in preference to, the others? Every one in its own place is essentially necessary. 

If we examine the word *saved* in the New Testament, we shall find that we are said to be saved by as many causes, though some of them differently denominated, as those by which we are said to be justified. Let us see: we are said to be "saved by grace," Eph. 2:5; "saved through his life," Rom. 5:9-10; "saved through faith," Eph. 2:8, Acts 16:31; "saved by baptism," 1 Peter 3:21; or "by faith and baptism,"  Mark  16:16;  or  "by  the  washing  of  regeneration  and renewal of the Holy Spirit," Titus 3:5; or "by the gospel," 1 Cor. 15:2; or "by calling upon the Lord," and by "enduring to the end," Acts  2:21,  Rom.  10:13,  Matt.  10:22.  Here  we  have  salvation ascribed  to  grace,  to  Jesus  Christ,  to  his  death  and resurrection — *three*  times  to  baptism,  either  by  itself  or  in conjunction,  once  with  faith,  and  once  with  the  Holy  Spirit;  to works, or to calling upon the Lord, or to enduring to the end. To these we might add other phrases nearly similar, but these include all the causes to which we have just now alluded. Saved by grace the *moving* cause; by Jesus the *efficient* cause; by his death, and resurrection,  and  life,  the  *procuring*  cause;  by  the  gospel,  the *disposing*  cause;  by  faith,  the  *formal*  cause;  by  baptism,  the *immediate* cause; and by enduring to the end, or persevering in the Lord, the *concurring* cause. 

***Peter in Jerusalem, Paul in Philippi, Reconciled*** 

Thousands  ask  Peter,  *What  shall  we  do?*  The  Jailor  asks  Paul, *What shall I do?* **to be saved**, if the reader pleases. Peter says, Reform,  and  be  baptized  every  one  of  you,  etc.  Paul  answers, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, with thy family." How is this, Paul and Peter? Why do you not preach the same gospel, and answer the same question in the same or similar terms? Paul, do you preach another gospel to the Gentiles, than Peter  preached  to  the  Jews?  What  sayest  thou,  Paul?  Paul replies — "Strike, but hear me. Had I been in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost,  I would have spoken as Peter did. Peter spoke to believing and penitent Jews; I spoke to an ignorant Roman jailor. I arrested his attention after the earthquake, by simply announcing that there was salvation to him and all his family, through belief in Jesus." — But  why  did  you  not  mention  repentance,  baptism,  the Holy Spirit? "Who told you I did not?" Luke adds nothing about it; and I concluded you said nothing about them. — Luke was a faithful historian, was he not? "Yes, very faithful: and why did you not faithfully hearken to his account? Does he not immediately subjoin that as soon as I got the jailor's ear, I *spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all that were in his house?*" Why you reason like a Paidobaptist.  You  think,  do  you,  that  the  jailor's  children  were saved by his faith! I spoke the whole gospel, or word of the Lord to the jailor and to his family. In speaking *the word of the Lord,* I mentioned  repentance,  baptism,  remission,  the  Holy  Spirit,  the resurrection, judgment, and eternal life: else why should I have baptized him and all his house; and why should he have rejoiced afterwards with all his family!" Paul, I beg your pardon. I will not interrogate Peter, for I know how he will answer me: he would say — "Had I been in Philippi, I would have spoken to an ignorant Pagan as Paul did, to show that salvation flowed through faith in Jesus; and when he believed this and repented, I would *then* have said, Be baptized for the remission of your sins."

27 To prevent mistakes, I shall here transcribe a part of a note found in the Appendix to the second edition of the *new version* of the Christian Scriptures, p. 452.  

- I  am  not  desirous  of  diminishing  the  difference  of  meaning  between 

immersing a person *in the name* of the Father, and *into the name* of the Father. They are quite different ideas. But it will be asked, Is this a correct translation? To which I answer most undoubtedly it is. For the preposition *eis* is that used in this place, and not *en.* By what *inadvertency* the king's translators gave it *in* instead of *into* in this passage, and elsewhere gave it *into* when speaking of the same ordinance, I presume not to say. But they have been followed by most modern translators, and with them they translate it *into* in other places where it occurs, in relation *to this* *institution:* For example: — 1 Co 12:13. For by one spirit we are all immersed *into* one body; Rom. 6:3. Don't you know that so many of you as were immersed *into* Christ, were immersed *into* his death? Gal. 3:27. As many of you as have been immersed *into* Christ, have put on Christ. Now, for the same reason they ought to have rendered the following passages the same way. Acts 8:16. Only they were immersed *into* the name of the Lord Jesus. 19: 3. *Into* what name were you then immersed? When they heard this, they were immersed *into* the name of the Lord Jesus. 1 Co 1:13. Were you immersed *into* the name of Paul? Lest any should say I had immersed *into* my own name. 1 Co 10:1. Our fathers were all immersed *into* Moses in the cloud and in the sea. Now in all these places it is *eis* and *en* is clearly marked in the last quotation. They were immersed *into* Moses — not *into* the cloud, and *into* the sea, but *in* the cloud and *in* the sea. To be immersed *into* Moses is one thing, and *in* the sea is another. To be immersed *into* the name of Father, and *in* the name of the Father, are just as distinct. " *In the name*" is equivalent to, "*by the authority of.*" In the name of the king, or commonwealth, is by the authority of the king or commonwealth. Now the question is, Did the Savior mean that the disciples were to be immersed by the authority of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit? If by the authority of the Father, for what purpose were they immersed? The authority by which any action is done is one thing, and the object for which it is done is another. Now who that can discriminate, can think that it is one and the same thing to be immersed *in* the name of the Lord, and to  be  immersed  *into*  the  name  of  the  Lord  Jesus.  The  former  denotes  the authority by which the action is performed — the latter the object for which it is performed.  Persons  are  said  to  enter  *into*  matrimony,  to  enter  *into*  and alliance, to get *into* debt, to run *into* danger. Now to be immersed *into* the name of the Lord Jesus was a form of speech, in ancient usage, as familiar and significant as any of the preceding. And when we analyze these expression, we find  they  all  import  that  the  persons  are  either  under  the  obligations  or influence of those things into which they are said to enter, or into which they are  introduced.  Hence  those  immersed  into  one  body,  were  under  the influences and obligations of that body. Those immersed into Moses, assumed Moses as their lawgiver, guide, and protector, and risked every thing upon his authority,  wisdom,  power,  and  goodness.  Those  who  were  immersed  into Christ  put  him  on,  and  acknowledged  his  authority  and  laws,  and  were governed  by  his  will:  and  those  who  were  immersed  into  the  name  of  the Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Spirit,  regarded  the  Father  as  the  fountain  of  all authority — the Son as the only Savior — and the Holy Spirit as the only advocate 

28 *State* here has respect to the whole person. It may be argued that state is as pertinently applied to the mind or heart as to the whole person; and that when the state of the mind is changed by a belief of God's testimony, the subject of that change is brought into as near a relation to God as he can be in this life; and as the kingdom of Jesus is a spiritual kingdom, he is as fit for admission into it, and for the enjoyment of its blessings, whenever his heart is changed from enmity to love, as he ever can be; nay, in truth, is actually initiated into the kingdom of Jesus the moment his mind is changed — and that to insist upon any personal act as necessary to admission, because  such acts are necessary to admission  into  all  the  social  and  political  relations  in  society,  is  an over-straining the analogies between things earthly and things heavenly. Not one  of  our  opponents,  as  far  as  we  remember,  has  thus  argued.  We  have sometimes thought that they might have thus argued with incomparably more speciosity than appears in any of their objections.  

`  `But without pausing to inquire whether the state of the heart can be perfectly changed  from  enmity  to  love,  without  an  assurance  of  remission  on  some ground,  or  in  consequence  of  some  *act  of  the  mind*  prerequisite thereunto; — without being at pains to show that the truth of this proposition is not at all essential to our argument, but only *illustrative* of it; we may say, that as Christ has redeemed the whole man, body, soul, and spirit, by his obedience even to death — so in coming into his kingdom on earth, and in order to the *enjoyment* of all the present salvation, the *state of the whole person* must be changed; and this is what we apprehend Jesus meant by his saying, " Unless a *man* is born of *water and spirit*, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God," and what we mean in distinguishing a change of heart, or of views and feelings, from a change of state.

36  There  is  no  propriety  in  the  common  version  of  this  member  of  the sentence — *when,*  instead  of  *that,*  "seasons  of  refreshment."  Some  make modern *revivals* "seasons of refreshment," such as these here alluded to. Then it would read, ' That your sins may be blotted out in times of revivals' — when revivals shall come! The term is *opos,* which, in this construction, as various critics  have  contended,  is  equivalent  to  '*that*'  in  our  tongue.  To  promise  a future remission is no part of the gospel, nor of the apostolic proclamation. All Christians experience seasons of refreshment in cordially obeying the gospel.

40 The following examples of the above general rule illustrate its value and certainty: — " Let us offer up the sacrifice of praise to God, *confessing* to his name."  Heb.  13:15.  "  Let  us  go  forth  to  him  out  of  the  camp,  *bearing*  his reproach." Heb. 13:13. " Be an approved workman, *rightly* dividing the word of truth." 2 Tim. 2:15. " Guard the precious deposit, *avoiding* profane babblings." 1  Tim.  6:20.  "  Observe  these  things  without  prejudice,  *doing*  nothing  by partiality." 1 Tim. 5:21. " Pray every where *lifting* up holy hands." 1 Tim. 2:8. " Walking in wisdom to them that are without, *gaining* time." Col. iv: 5. " Do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, *giving* thanks to God." Col. 3:17. " Speak the truth, *putting* away lying." Eph. 4:25. " Be not vainglorious, *provoking* one another. Gal. 5:26. " Convert the nations, *baptizing* them," etc. etc. Now, do not all these participles define their respective imperatives, or show the way and manner in which this command should be obeyed! Many similar examples may be found in all the sacred writings.  

`  `This  rule  has  passed  through  a  fiery  trial.  I  have  only  been  more  fully convinced of its generality and value. There is no rule in the English syntax more general in its application. I would only add, that the participle does not always express every thing in the command; but it always points out something emphatically  in  the  intention  of  the  imperative,  and  without  which  the injunction cannot be suitably and fully performed.  

`  `We  have,  however,  no  need  of  this  rule,  nor  of  anything  not  generally conceded,  to  establish  the  point  before  us:  for  the  New  Testament  and  all antiquity teach, that so long as the Apostles lived, no one was regarded as a disciple of Christ who had not confessed his faith and was immersed.  

41 Titus 3:5.  

42 See the following essay on Regeneration.  

43 That John 3:5, and Titus 3:5, refer to immersion, is the judgment of all the learned Catholics and Protestants of every name under heaven.  

`  `The  authors  and  finishers  of  the  Westminster  creed — one  hundred  and twenty-one Divines, ten Lords, and twenty Commissioners of the Parliament of England, under the question 165, " *What is baptism?*" quote John 3:5, Titus 3:5, to prove that baptism is a washing with water, and a "*sign of remission of sins.*"    Michaelis, Horne, Lightfoot, Beveridge, Taylor, Jones of Nayland, Bp. Mant, Whitby, Burkit, Bp. Hall, Dr. Wells, Hooker, Dr. C. Ridley, Bp. Ryder: — but why attempt a list of great names? There are a thousand more who assert it.  

`  `Bp. White says, that "regeneration, as detached from baptism, never entered into any creed before the 17th century."  

`  `Whitby,  on  John  3:5,  says,  "  That  our  Lord  here  speaks  of  baptismal regeneration, *the whole Christian church* from its *earliest times* has *invariably taught.*"  

`  `Our modern "great divines," even in America, have taught the same. Timothy Dwight, the greatest Rabbi of Presbyterians the New World has produced, says, vol. 4: pp. 300, 301, "*to be born again,* is precisely the same thing as to be born of water and the Spirit." — " To be born of water is to be baptized." And how uncharitable! —  He adds, " He who understanding the nature and authority of this institution, refuses to be baptized, WILL NEVER ENTER INTO THE VISIBLE NOR INVISIBLE KINGDOM OF GOD." Vol. 4: p. 302. So preached the President of Yale.  

`  `George Whitefield, writing on John 3:5, says, " Does not this verse urge the *absolute necessity of water baptism? Yes,* when it may be had. But how God will deal with persons unbaptized, *we cannot tell.*" Vol. 4: p. 355. I say with him, *we cannot tell with certainty.* But I am of the opinion, that when a neglect proceeds  from  a  simple  mistake  of  sheer  ignorance,  and  when  there  is  no aversion, but a will to do everything the Lord commands, the Lord will admit into the everlasting kingdom those who by reason of this mistake never had the testimony  of  God  assuring  them  of  pardon  or  justification  here,  and consequently never did fully enjoy the salvation of God on earth. But I will say with the renowned President of Yale, that "he who, understanding the nature and authority of this institution, refuses to be baptized, will never enter the visible nor invisible kingdom of God." By the "visible and invisible kingdom," he means the kingdom of grace and glory. He adds on the same page, " He who persists in this act of rebellion against the authority of Christ, will never belong to his kingdom." Vol. 4: p. 302.  

`  `John Wesley asserts, that by baptism we enter into *covenant with God,* an everlasting covenant, are admitted into the church, made members of Christ, made the children of God. By *water* as the *means,* the waters of baptism, we are regenerated or born again."

Part V: Regeneration. 

1. Regeneration 
- I create New Heavens and a New 

`  `Isa 65:18. Earth." 

- Behold, I make all things new."   Rev. 21:5. 

` `We  intend  an  essay  of  "the  seeds  of  things."  The  topic  is  a common one, a familiar one, and yet an interesting one. Much has been said, much has been written upon it; and yet it is no better understood than it ought to be. Few give themselves the trouble of thinking much on the things which they think they understand; and many would rather follow the thoughts of others, than think for themselves. Suspense is painful, much study is a weariness of the flesh; and, therefore, the majority are content with the views and opinions handed to them from those who have gone before. 

We  wish  to  treat  this  subject  as  if  it  were  a  new  one;  and  to examine it now, as if we had never examined it before. It is worthy of it. Generation is full of wonders, for it is full of God's physical grandeur;  yet  regeneration  is  still  more  admirable,  for  in  it  the moral attributes of Jehovah are displayed. But  we aim not  at a development of its wonders, but at a plain common sense scriptural exposition of its import. 

We  have  not  learned  our  theology  from  Athanasius,  nor  our morality from Seneca; and, therefore, we shall not call upon them for  illustration,  argument,  or  proof.  To  the  Sacred  Records,  in which alone Christianity yet remains in all its freshness, we look for light; and thither would we direct the eyes of the readers. It is not the regeneration of the schools in which Christianity has been lowered, misapprehended, obscured, and adulterated, of which we are to write; but that regeneration of which Jesus spoke, and the Apostles wrote. 

A  few  things  must  be  premised — a  few  general  views expressed — before we, or our readers, are prepared for the more minute details: and to approach the subject with all unceremonious despatch, we observe, that —  

Man unregenerate is ruined in body, soul, and spirit; a frail and mortal  creature.  From  Adam  his  father  he  inherits  a  shattered constitution. He is the child of a fallen progenitor; a scion from a degenerate stock. 

Superior to Adam, the exile from Eden, in physical, intellectual, and moral nature, none of his descendants can rise. It is not in nature to improve itself; for above its fountain the stream cannot rise.  Cain,  the  first  born  of  Eve,  was  in  nature  the  image  and likeness of him that begat him. Education failed to improve him, while Abel, his  younger brother, obtained the excellency which faith in God's promise alone bestows. The first born, it will be conceded, was at least equal to his younger brother: and who can plead that in nature he excels Eve's eldest son! 

Man  in  his  ruins  is,  however,  a  proper  subject  of  a  remedial system. He is susceptible of renovation. Therefore God has placed him under a regenerating economy. This economy contemplates the regeneration of the whole human constitution, and proposes as its consummation the transformation of spirit, soul, and body. The destiny of the regenerate is described by Paul in one sentence: "As we now bear the image of the earthly Adam, we shall then bear the image of the heavenly Adam." 

God's  own  Son  is  proposed  as  a  model.  Conformity  to  him  in glory, honor, and immortality, as the perfection of the regenerate, is the predestination of him who speaks of things that are not, as though they were. 

Regeneration is, therefore, moral and physical: or, in other words, there is now a renovation of the mind — of the understanding, will, and  affections; — and  there  will  hereafter  be  a  renovation  of  the body: "For this corruptible body shall put on incorruption, and this mortal body shall put on immortality." 

The renovation of the mind and character is, therefore, that moral regeneration  which  is  to  be  effected  in  this  life;  for  which  the remedial system, or kingdom of heaven, was set up on earth; and this, therefore, first of all, demands our attention. 

Before we attempt an answer in detail to the question, *How is this moral regeneration effected?* we shall attend to the principle on which the whole remedial system proceeds. The grand principle, or means  which  God  has  adopted  for  the  accomplishment  of  this moral regeneration, is the full demonstration and proof of a single proposition  addressed  to  the  reason  of  man.  This  sublime proposition is, **that** **God is love**. 

The reason and  wisdom of this  procedure will  suggest  itself to every  one,  who  can  understand  the  views  and  feelings  of  all unregenerated  man.  Man  in  a  state  of  alienation  and  rebellion, naturally suspects, that if he be a sinner, and if God hate sin, he must hate him. As love begets love; so hatred begets hatred; and if a sinner suspects that God hates him, he cannot love God. He must know that God loves him, before he can begin to love God. "We," says  an  Apostle,  "love  God  because  he  first  loved  us." — While alienated  in  heart,  through  the  native  darkness  of  his understanding, the sinner misinterprets every restraint which God has placed in his way to prevent his total ruin, as indications of the wrath  of  Heaven.  His  transgression  of  these  restraints,  and  his consciousness of having defied the veracity and power of God, only increase his enmity, and urge him onward to his apostasy and wanderings  from  his  Creator.  The  goodness  of  God  being misunderstood, furnishes to  him  no incentive to repentance and reformation. Guilt, and fear, and shame, the fruits of his apostasy, becloud  his  understanding,  and  veil  from  his  eyes  all  the demonstrations  of  benevolence  and  goodness,  with  which  the creation abounds. Adam under a tree, hiding from God, trembling with fear, suspicious of the movements of every leaf, and covered with shame as a garment, is both an illustration and proof of these views of the state of mind, which obtains in the unregenerate. 

Neither the volume of creation, nor that of God's providence, is sufficient to remove from the natural man these misconceptions and the consequent alienation of heart. The best proof that these two volumes cannot do this, is, that they never have, in any one instance, yet done it. From the nature of things it is indeed evident that they cannot do it. The elements are too often at war with the happiness of man. The ever changing attitude of the natural world in  reference  to  health,  and  life,  and  comfort,  render  it  at  best doubtful, whether the laws of nature, which ultimately bring man down to the grave, are the effect of benevolence, or of malevolence towards mankind. A third volume explanatory of both, and replete also  with  supernatural  developments,  is  wanting,  to  furnish  the most diligent student of nature and providence, with the means of learning the true and full character of him, against whom we have rebelled. 

That volume is the Bible. Holy Prophets and Apostles spake as they were moved by the Spirit of Knowledge and Revelation. Its records,  its  history,  it  prophecy,  its  precepts,  its  laws,  its ordinances, and its examples, all develop and reveal God to man, and man to himself. 

But it is in the person and mission of the **Incarnate** **Word**, that we learn that *God is love.* That God gave his Son for us, and yet gives his Spirit to us — and this gives us himself — are the mysterious and transcendent proofs of the most august proposition in the universe. The gospel, Heaven's  wisdom and power combined, God's own expedient for the renovation of human nature, is neither more nor less, than the illustration and proof of this regenerating proposition. 

Thus  we  hasten  to  our  subject.  Having  glanced  at  the  great landmarks of the plantations of nature and grace, now that we may, in the light of truth, ascertain the true and heaven-taught doctrine of regeneration, we shall cautiously survey the whole process, as developed by the commissioned teachers of the deep counsels of the only true God. 

The  certain  things,  parts  of  this  great  progress,  may  be  well understood, certain terms, which are wont to use to represent them, must be well defined, and accurately apprehended. These terms are *Fact,  Testimony,  Faith,  Repentance,  Reformation,  Bath  of Regeneration, New Birth, Renewing of the Holy Spirit, Newness of Life.*1 

"All things are of God" in the regeneration of man, is our motto; because our Apostle affirmed this as a cardinal truth. He is the author of the *facts* and of the *testimony* which declares them; and being  the  author  of  these,  he  is  the  author  of  all  the  effects produced by these facts. The Christian is a new *creation,* of which God is the *Creator.* The change of heart and of character, which constitute moral regeneration, is the legitimate impression of the facts, or things which God has wrought. The facts constitute the moral  seal  which  stamps  the  image  of  God  upon  man.  In  the natural order, we must place them first, and, therefore, we must first define the term.  

***Repentance*** 

Repentance is usually defined "*sorrow for anything that is past;*" and in the religious vocabulary it is simply "*sorrow for sin.*" This is one, but it is only one of the natural effects of the belief of the testimony  of  God.  The  gospel  facts,  testimony,  and  faith, contemplate more than this. But yet it is necessary that this point of faith should be distinctly apprehended, especially in this age, when it occupies so large a space in the systems of theology. 

Repentance,  in  our  current  acceptation,  is  sorrow  for  sin;  and certainly there is no man who believes the revealed facts found in the  testimony  of  God,  who  will  not  be  sorry  for  his  sins.  But simple sorrow for the past, is but a feeling of the heart; which, unless it excite to reformation or the abandonment of sin, is of no more use than the regrets of Judas after he had sold his Master for fifteen dollars. Repentance must, however, precede reformation; for unless we are sorry for the past, and grieved with ourselves, we will  not  think  of  a  change  of  conduct.  Repentance  is  to reformation,  what  motive  is  to  action,  or  resolution  to  any undertaking. It was well for David to resolve to build the temple; and  so  it  is  well  to  form  any  good  design;  but  much  better  to execute  it.  To  feel  sorry  for  the  poor  and  the  afflicted,  and  to resolve to assist and comfort them, is well; but to go and do it is better:  and,  indeed  unless  our  sorrow  for  the  past,  terminate  in reformation for the future, it is useless in the estimation of heaven and earth; as useless as to say to the hungry, Be filled; or to the naked, Be clothed. 

Genuine repentance does not always issue in reformation. Judas was sorrowful even to  death, but could not reform. Many have been so genuinely sorry for their sins, as to become suicides. Speak we  of  "a  godly  sorrow?"  No:  this  is  not  to  be  expected  from unconverted and ungodly persons. Christians, Paul teaches, when they err, may repent with a godly sorrow; but this is not to be expected  from  the  unregenerate,  or  from  those  who  have  not reformed. It is not, then, the genuineness of repentance that is to be appreciated,  unless  by  genuine  repentance  is  meant  more  than simple sorrow for the past — unless by genuine repentance is meant reformation.  Yet  without  sincere  or  unfeigned  repentance,  there cannot be real or genuine reformation. 

This leads us to observe, that the only unequivocal evidence of sincere repentance, is the actual redress of the injury done; not only a cessation  from  the sin,  but  a restitution  for the sin,  as far as restitution  can  possibly  be  made.  *No  restitution,  no repentance — provided  restitution  can  be  made.*  And  I  may  be permitted  to  add,  *that without  repentance  and  restitution,  when possible, there can be no remission.* 

The  preachers  of  repentance — of  the  necessity  of  repentance  in order to remission, ought to set this matter fairly and fully before sinners. Do they represent repentance as sorrow for the past, and a determination to reform? How then will the sinner know that he is sorry for his sins against men, or how will the community know that he has repented of such sins, unless full restitution was made? It is impossible that either the sinner himself, or the community who know his sins against man, can have any certain evidence that he is penitent, unless by making all possible restitution. 

Peccator wounded the reputation of his neighbor Hermas, and on another  occasion  defrauded  him  of  ten  pounds. — Some  of  the neighborhood were apprised that he had done both. Peccator was converted under the preaching of Paulinus, and, on giving in  a relation  of  his  sorrow  for  his  sins,  spoke  of  the  depth  of  his convictions, and of his abhorrence of his transgression. He was received into the congregation, and sat down with the faithful to commemorate  the  great  sin  offering.  Hermas  and  his  neighbors were witnesses of all this. They saw that Peccator was penitent, and much reformed in his behavior; but they could not believe him sincere, because he had made no restitution. They regarded him either as a hypocrite or self-deceived; because, having it in  his power, he repaid  not  the ten pounds,  nor once contradicted the slanders  he  had  propagated.  Peccator,  however,  felt  little enjoyment in his profession, and soon fell back into his former habits. He became again penitent, and on examining the grounds of his falling off, discovered that he had never cordially turned away from his sins. Overwhelmed in sorrow for the past, he resolved on giving himself up to the Lord; and, reflecting on his past life, set about the work of reformation in earnest. He called on Hermas, paid him his ten pounds, and the interest for every day he had kept it back, went to all the persons to whom he had slandered him, told them what injustice he had done him, and begged them, if they had told it to any other persons, to contradict it. Several other persons whom he had wronged in his dealings with them, he also visited; and fully redressed all these wrongs against his neighbors. He also confessed  them  to  the  Lord,  and  asked  him  to  forgive  him. Peccator  was  then  restored  to  the  church;  and  better  still,  he enjoyed a peace of mind, and a confidence in God, which was a continual feast. His example, moreover, did more to enlarge the congregation at the Cross-roads, than did the preaching of Paulinus in a whole year. This was, unequivocally, *sincere* repentance. 

This is the repentance which Moses preached, and which Jesus approbated.  Under  the  law,  confession  to  the  priest,  and  the presenting of a trespass offering, availed nothing to forgiveness without restitution. But the law went into details still more minute than these; for provision is made for the case in which the sinner could not find the person against whom he had sinned. In such a case, the penitent sinner was to seek out the kindred of the injured party, and if he could find any kinsman, he was to recompense this kinsman; but if he could not find a kinsman, he must recompense it to the Lord, besides offering his trespass offering. It was to go into the Lord's treasury.2 The principle uniformly, in all cases of sin 

against man, was, the sinner "shall make amends for the harm he has done, and shall add the fifth part thereto."3 

If  any  one  suppose  that  repentance  is  to  be  less  sincere  or unequivocal  under  the  gospel,  let  him  remember  that  Zaccheus proposed more than adding a fifth; he would restore fourfold, and that Jesus approbated him for so doing. Indeed, John the Immerser demanded fruits worthy of repentance or of reformation, and Paul proclaimed that those who turned to God should do works meet for, or worthy of, repentance.4 

"Works,  worthy  of  repentance,"  is  a  phrase  which  can  be understood in no other sense than those works which make amends for the harm done to men and the dishonor done to God, as far as both are possible. Can any man think that he is sorry for that sin or wrong  which  he  has  done,  when  he  makes  no  effort  to  make amends to him who was injured in person, character, or property, by it? Works worthy of his professed repentance are wanting, so long as any being whom he has injured in person, property, or reputation, is unredressed to the utmost extent of his ability. 

One  of  our  most  popular  commentators  says — and  with  much truth — "No  man  should  expect  mercy  at  the  hand  of  God,  who having wronged his neighbor, refuses, when he has it in his power, to  make  *restitution.*  Were  he  to  weep  tears  of  blood,  both  the justice and mercy of God would shut out his prayer, if he make not his  neighbor  amends  for  the  injury  he  has  done  him.  He  is  a dishonest man, who illegally holds the property of another in his hands."5 

Every preacher of repentance should insist upon these evidences of sincerity both for the satisfaction of the penitent himself, and for the  good  of  the  community.  "Many  that  believed  came  and confessed, and showed their deeds; many of them also, who used curious arts, bringing their books together, burnt them before all; and they computed the value of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver."6 This was making restitution, in their case, as far as possible; and the principle here evinced is applicable in every other case. 

But  in  pursuing  this  subject  so  far,  we  have  passed  over  the boundaries  of  repentance,  and  sometimes  confounded  it  with reformation. This is owing to the licentious use of language, to which  modern  theology  has  so  richly  contributed.  We  shall, however,  redress  this  wrong,  as  far  as  practicable,  by  a  few remarks on 

***Reformation*** 

The word *metanoia,* used by the sacred writers and heaven-taught preachers of the New Economy, as indicative of the first effect of faith, as has been often showed, is different from that which our word *repentance* fitly represents. It literally imports *a change of mind;* but, as Parkhurst, Campbell, and many others say, "such a change of mind as influences one's subsequent behavior for the better." "It has been observed by some, and, I think with reason, that the former (*matanoeo*) denotes properly a change to the better: the latter (*matamelomai*) barely a change, whether to the better or to  the  worse;  that  the  former  marks  a  change  of  mind  that  is durable, and produces consequences; the latter expresses only a present  uneasy  feeling  of  regret,  without  regard  to  duration  or effects:  in  fine,  that  the  first  may  be  translated  into  English,  *I reform;*  the  second,  *I  repent,*  in  the  familiar  acceptation  of  the words." Now as every one who reforms *repents;* but as every one who  repents  does  *not  reform,*  this  distinction  is  necessary  and proper; and there is nothing hazarded, nothing lost by translating the former *I reform,* and the latter *I repent.* There is something gained, especially in  all places  where we have the word in  the imperative  mood,  because  then  it  is  of  importance  to  know precisely what is intended. If we are commanded only to change our mind, or to be sorry for the past, we have obeyed when we feel regret; but if more than mere change of mind or regret is intended, we have not obeyed the commandment until we change for the better. Now it is, we think, very evident from various passages of the sacred writings of the Apostles, and from their speeches, that they commanded more than a simple change of mind as respected past conduct, or mere sorrow for the past. Peter commanded the thousands assembled on the day of Pentecost, who had changed their  minds,  and  who were  sorry  for  the  past,  to  do  something which they had not yet done; and that something is in the common version rendered *repent;* and in the new version, *reform;* and in the old English Bible, *amend your lives.* The word here used is the imperative of *metanoeo.* Judas repented, and many like him, who never  reformed;  and,  therefore,  it  is  of  importance  that  this distinction should be kept in view."7 

Repentance is not reformation, but it is necessary to it; for whoever reforms must first repent. Reformation is, indeed, the carrying out of the purpose into our conduct. But as reformation belongs rather to  another  part  of  our  essay  than  the  present,  we  shall,  on  the premises already before us, pause and offer a few reflections. 

In the preceding definition of words and ideas, it would appear that we  have  a  literal  and  unfigurative  representation  of  the  whole process of what is figuratively called *regeneration.* For, as we shall soon see, the term *regeneration* is a figure of speech which very appropriately, though analogically, represents the reformation or renovation of life of which we have now spoken. 

That the preceding arrangement is not arbitrary, but natural and necessary, the reader will perceive, when he reflects, that the thing done, or the fact, must precede the report or testimony concerning it; that the testimony concerning it must precede the belief of it; that  belief  of  the  testimony  must  precede  any  feeling  in correspondence  with  the  fact  testified;  and  that  feeling  must precede action in conformity to it. Fact, testimony, faith, feeling, action,  are  therefore  bound  together  by  a  natural  and  gracious necessity, which no ingenuity  can separate.  And will not  every Christian say, that when a person *feels* and *acts* according to the faith,  or  the  testimony  of  God,  he  is  a  new creature — regenerate — truly converted to God? He that believes the facts  testified  in  the  record  of  God,  understands  them,  feels according to their nature and meaning, and acts in correspondence with  them — has  undergone  a  change  of  heart  and  of  life  which makes him a new man. 

This is that moral change of heart and life, which is figuratively called  *regeneration.*  We are not  to  suppose that  regeneration is something which must be added to the faith, the feeling, and the action or behavior, which are the effects of the testimony of God understood and embraced; or which are the impress of the divine facts attested by Prophets and Apostles. It is only another name for the same process in all its parts. 

It may also be observed that numerous figures and analogies are used by the inspired writers to set forth this change, as well as other leading truths and lessons in the Bible. In their collective capacity, Christians are called a kingdom, a nation, a generation, a family, a house, a flock, a city, a temple, a priesthood, etc. In their individual capacity they are called kings, priests, soldiers, citizens, children, sheep, branches, stones, etc. They are said to be begotten, born, regenerated, builded, engrafted, converted, created, planted. Now,  under  whatever  figure  they  are  considered  or  introduced, reason argues that everything said of them should be expressed in conformity with the figure under which they are presented. Are they  called  *sheep?* — then  he  that  presides  over  them  is  called  a *Shepherd;* their enemies are *wolves* and *dogs;* their sustenance is the *green pasture;* their place of safety and repose, the *sheepfold;* their  errors  are  *wanderings*  and  *strayings;*  their  conversion,  a *return;*  and  their  good  behavior  a  *hearing  of  the  voice,*  or  a *following,*  of  the  Shepherd.  Are  they  called  *children?* — then collectively they are a *family;* they are *begotten* and *born again;* God is their *Father;* their separation is an *adoption;* Jesus is their *elder brother;* they are *heirs* of God; they *live* and *walk* with God. Are  they  *priests?* — Jesus  is  their  *High  Priest;*  the  church  their *temple;*  the  Savior  is  their  *altar;*  their  songs,  their  praises,  are *incense* ascending to heaven; and their oblations to the poor, their works of love, are  *sacrifices* most acceptable to  God. Are they called  *citizens?* — the  church  is  then  *the  kingdom  of  heaven; Jerusalem is the mother of them all;* formerly they were *aliens,* and 

their  naturalization  is  *regeneration.*  Are  they  called *branches?* — then Jesus is the *true vine;* his Father the *vine dresser;* their union with Christ, an *engrafting;* the discipline of the gospel, a *pruning;* and their good works are *fruits of righteousness.* 

Thus  there  is  no  confusion  of  metaphor  in  the  Scriptures  of truth — in the dialect of heaven.  It is the language of Ashdod; it belongs  to  the  confusion  of  Babel,  to  mingle  and  confound  all figures and analogies. Hence are so often hear of *being born again,* without any allusion to a family or a kingdom! and of *regeneration* as antecedent to faith or repentance! Had a modern assembly of Divines been employed to accommodate the scripture style to their orthodox sentiments, we should not have had to read all the Old Testament and all the historic books of the New, to find the subject of regeneration but once proposed to an alien, as the fact is; but then we should have found it in the history of Abel, of Enoch, of Noah, and of Abraham, if not in every section of the law of Moses, in the Prophets, and in the Psalms. John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Holy Twelve, would have had it in every sermon; and truth faith would have been always defined as the fruit of regeneration. 

But Jesus had a *kingdom* in his eye and in his discourse before he ever mentioned being 'born again' to Nicodemus; for unless there was a family, a state, or a kingdom to be born into, it is impossible for any one to be born into it. And if the kingdom of heaven only began to be after Jesus entered into heaven; or, if it is was only approaching from the ministry of John to the day of Pentecost, then it would have been preposterous indeed — an incongruity of which no inspired man was every guilty — to call any change of heart or life, *a regeneration,* or *a new birth.* It is true that good men in all ages were made such by facts, testimony, faith, and feeling, by a change of heart, by the Spirit of God; but the *analogy* or *figure* of being *born,* or of being *regenerated,* only began to be preached, and when men began to press into it. 

We are now, perhaps, better prepared to consider the proper import and  meaning  of  '*regeneration*'  in  general,  and  of  '*the  bath  of regeneration*' in particular. 

***Regeneration*** 

This word is found but twice in all the oracles of God — once in Matt.  19:28.  and  once  in  Titus  3:5.  In  the  former  it  is  almost universally  understood  to  mean  *a  new  state  of  things,*  not  of *persons* — a peculiar era, in which all things are made new: — such as the formation  of  a new  church on the day of  Pentecost,  or the commencement of the Millennium, or the general resurrection. The biblical critics of eminence have assigned it to one or other of these great changes in the state of things. So we use the word *revolution,* and the phrase *the Revolution,* to express a change in the political state of things. The most approved punctuation and version of this passage renders it altogether evident that a new era is alluded to. 'Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, that at the renovation when the Son of Man shall be seated on his glorious throne, you, my followers, sitting also upon twelve thrones, shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel.' This being so evident, and so often alluded to in our former writings, we shall proceed to the remaining occurrence, Titus 3:5. 

All the new light which we propose to throw on this passage will be gathered from an examination of the acceptation of the word *generation* in the sacred writings. Our reason for this is, that we object to a peremptory decision of the meaning of a word which occurs only in the passage under discussion, from our reasonings upon the isolated passages in which it is found. In such a case, if we cannot find the whole word in any parallel passages, the proper substitute is the root or branches of that word, so far as they are employed  by  the  same  writers.  Moreover,  we  think  it  will  be granted, that, whatever may be the scriptural  acceptation of the word *generation,* regeneration is only the repetition of that act or process. 

After  a  close  examination  of  the  passages  in  which  *generation* occurs in the writings of the Hebrew Prophets and Apostles, we find it used only in two acceptations — as descriptive of the whole process of creation and of the thing created. A race of man, or a particular  class  of  men,  is  called  a  *generation;*  but  this  is  its figurative, rather than its literal meaning. Its literal meaning is the formation or creation of anything. Thus it is first used in the Holy Scriptures. Moses calls the creation, or whole process of formation of the heavens and the earth, 'The *generations* of the heavens and the earth.'8 The account of the formation of Adam and Eve, and 

also the account of the creations of Adam and Eve, are, by the same  writer,  called  'The  book  or  record  of  the  *generations*  of Adam.'9  This  is  the  literal  import  of  the  word;  consequently, *regeneration* literally indicates the whole process of renovating or new-creating man. 

This process may consist of numerous distinct acts; but it is in accordance  with  the  general  usage  to  give  to  the  beginning,  or consummating act, the name of the whole process. For the most part,  however,  the  name  of  the  whole  process  is  given  to  the consummating  act,  because  the  process  is  always  supposed incomplete until that act is performed. For example: In the process of tanning, fulling, forging, etc. the subject of these operations is not  supposed  to  be  tanned,  fulled,  forged,  until  the  last  act  is performed.  So  in  all  the  processes  of  nature — in  the  animal, vegetable,  and  mineral  kingdoms,  the  last  act  consummates  the process.  To  all  acquainted  with  the  process  of  animalization, germination,  crystallization,  etc.  no  farther  argument  is  needed. But in the style of our American husbandmen, no crop nor animal is *made,* until it come to maturity. We often hear them say of a good shower, or a few clear days, "This is the *making* of the wheat or  corn."  In  the  same  sense  it  is,  that  most  Christians  call *regeneration* **the new birth**; though *being born* is only the last act in natural generation, and the last act in regeneration. 

In  this  way  the  *new  birth*  and  *regeneration*  are  used indiscriminately by commentators and writers on theology, and by a figure of speech, it is justified on well established principles of rhetoric. This leads us to speak particularly of (the next chapter) 

2. The Bath of Regeneration 

By '*the bath of regeneration*' is not meant the first, second, or third act; but the last act of regeneration, which completes the whole; and is, therefore, used to denote the new birth. This is the reason why our Lord and his Apostles unite this act with water. Being *born of water,* in the Savior's style, and *the bath of regeneration,* in the Apostles' style, in the judgement of all writers and critics of eminence, refer to one and the same act — viz: christian baptism. Hence it came to pass, that *all the ancients* (as fully proved in our first  Extra  on  Remission)  used  the  word  *regeneration*  as synonymous  in  signification  with  *immersion.*  In  addition  to  the numerous quotations made in our Essay on Remission, from the creeds and liturgies of Protestant churches, we shall add another from  the  Common  Prayer  of  the  Church  of  England,  showing unequivocally  that  the  learned  Doctors  of  that  church  used  the words *regeneration* and *baptism* as synonymous. In the address and prayer of the minister after the baptism  of the child, he is commanded to say, —   

"Seeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that this child is regenerate, and grafted into the body of Christ's church, let us give thanks unto Almighty God for these benefits, and with one accord make our prayer  unto  him  that  this  child  may  lead  the  rest  of  his  life according to this beginning." 

"Then shall be said, all kneeling — " 

"We yield thee hearty thanks, most merciful Father, that it hath pleased  thee  to  regenerate  this  infant  with  thy  Holy  Spirit,  to receive him for thine own child by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy church. And humbly we beseech thee to grant that he, being dead unto sin, and living unto righteousness, and being buried with Christ in his death, may crucify the old man, and utterly  abolish  the  whole  body  of  sin;  and  that  as  he  is  made partaker of the death of thy Son, he may also be partaker of his resurrection; so that finally, with the residue of the holy church, he may be an inheritor of thine everlasting kingdom, through Christ our Lord. Amen!" 

Eusebius,  in  his  life  of  Constantine,  page  628,  shows  that  St. Cyprian, St. Athanasius, and, indeed, all the Greek Fathers, did regard baptism as the consummating act; and therefore they call it *teliosis,* the consummation. These authorities weigh nothing with us; but, as they weigh with our opponents, we think it expedient to remind them on which side the Fathers depose in the case before us. By these quotations we would prove no more than that the ancients *understood* the washing of regeneration, and indeed used the term *regeneration,* as synonymous with baptism. 

But were we asked for the precise import of the phrase, 'washing or bath  of  regeneration,'  either  on  philological  principles,  or  as explained by the Apostles, we would give it as our judgment, that the  phrase  is  a  circumlocution  or  periphrasis  for  water.  It  is *loutron,*  a  word  which  more  properly  signifies  the  vessel  that contains the water, than the water itself; and is, therefore, by the most learned critics and translators, rendered *bath,* as indicative either of the vessel containing the fluid or of the use made of the fluid in the vessel. It is, therefore, by a metonymy, the water of baptism,  or  the  water  in  which  we  are  regenerated.  Paul  was Hebrew, and spoke in the Hebrew style. We must learn that style before we fully understand the Apostle's style. In other words, we must studiously read the Old Testament before we can accurately understand the New. What more natural for a Jew accustomed to speak of 'the water of purification,' of 'the water of separation,'10 to speak  of  'the  bath  of  regeneration?'  If  the  phrase  'water  of purification'  meant  water  used  for  the  purpose  of  purifying  a person — if 'the water of separation' meant water used for separating a person, what more natural than that 'the bath of regeneration' should mean water used for regenerating a person? 

But  the  New  Testament  itself  confirms  this  exposition  of  the phrase. We find the word *loutron* once more used by the same Apostle, in  the same connection of thought.  In his  letter to  the Ephesians, he affirms that Jesus has sanctified (separated, purified with the water of purification,) the church by a *loutron* of water — 'a 

bath  of  water,  with  the  word' — 'having  cleansed  it  by  a  bath  of water,  with  the  word.'11  This  is  still  more  decisive.  The  king's 

translators, so fully aware that the sense of this passage agrees with Titus  3:5.  have,  in  both  places,  used  the  word  *washing,*  and Macknight the term *bath* as the import of *loutron.* What is called the *washing* or *bath of regeneration,* in the one passage, is, in the other, called 'the washing' or 'bath of water.' What is called '*saved*' in one, is called '*cleansed*' in the other; and what is called '*the renewal of the Holy Spirit*' in the one, is called '*the word*' in the other; because the Holy Spirit consecrates or cleanses through the word. For thus prayed the Messiah, 'Consecrate them through the truth: thy word is the truth.' And again, 'You are clean through the word that I have spoken unto you.' 

To the same effect, Paul, to the Hebrew Christians, says 'Having your hearts sprinkled from a guilty conscience, and your bodies washed with pure water' — the water of purification, the water of regeneration: for the phrase 'pure water' must be understood not of the  quality  of  the  water,  but  metonymically  of  the  effect,  the cleansing, the washing, or the purifying of the person — 'having your bodies, or persons *washed* with pure water,' or water that purifies or cleanses. 

No one, acquainted with Peter's style, will think it strange that Paul represents  persons  as  *saved,  cleansed,*  or  *sanctified*  by  water; seeing  Peter  unequivocally  asserts  that  '*we  are  saved*'  through water, or through baptism, as was Noah and his family through water and faith in God's promise. 'The antitype immersion does also now save us.' 

Finally, our great Prophet, the Messiah, gives to water the same place and power in the work of regeneration. For when speaking of being *born again* — when explaining to Nicodemus *the new birth,* he says, 'Except a man be *born of water* and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." May not we, then, supported by such high authorities, call that water of which a person is born again, the water or bath of regeneration? 

***New Birth*** 

We have already seen that the consummation of the process of generation or creation is in the birth of the creature formed. So it is in the moral generation, or in the great process of regeneration. There is a state of existence from which he that is born passes; and there is a state of existence into which he enters after birth. This is true  of  the  whole  animal  creation,  whether  oviparous  and viviparous. Now the manner of existence, or the mode of life, is wholly changed; and he is, in reference to the former state, dead and to the new state alive. So in moral regeneration. The subject of this great change before his new birth, existed in one state; but after it, he exists in another. He stands in a new relation to God, angels, and men. He is now born of God, and has the privilege of being  a  son  of  God,  and  is  consequently  pardoned,  justified, sanctified, adopted, saved. The state which he left was a state of condemnation, what some call "the state of nature." The state into which  he  enters  is  a  state  of  favor,  in  which  he  enjoys  all  the heavenly  blessings  through  Christ:  therefore,  it  is  called  'the kingdom of heaven.' All this is signified in his death, burial, and resurrection with Christ; or in his being born of water. Hence, the necessity of being buried with Christ in water, that he may be born of water, that he may enjoy the renewal of the Holy Spirit, and be placed under the reign of favor. 

*All  the  means  of  salvation  are  means  of  enjoyment,  not  of procurement.* Birth itself is not for procuring, but for enjoying the life  possessed  before  birth.  So  in  the  analogy — no  one  is  to  be baptized, or to be buried with Christ; no one is to be put under the water of regeneration for the purpose of *procuring* life, but for the purpose of *enjoying* the life of which he is possessed. If the child is never  born,  all  its  sensitive  powers  and  faculties  cannot  be enjoyed; for it is after birth that these are fully developed, and feasted upon all the aliments and objects of sense in nature. Hence all that is *now* promised in the gospel, can only be *enjoyed* by those who are born again and placed in the kingdom of heaven under all its influences. Hence the philosophy of that necessity which Jesus preached — 'Unless  a  man  be  born  again,  he  cannot  discern  the kingdom of heaven' — unless a man be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into it. 

But let no man think that in the act of being born, either naturally or metaphorically, the child purchases, procures, or merits either life  or  its  enjoyments.  He  is  only  by  his  birth  placed  in circumstances  favorable  to  the  enjoyment  of  life,  and  all  that makes life a blessing. 'To as many as receive him, believing in his name, he grants the privilege of being children of God, who derive their birth not from blood, nor from the desire of the flesh, nor from the will of man, but from God.' 

***Renewing of the Holy Spirit*** 

'He  has  saved  us,'  says  the  Apostle  Paul,  'by  the  bath  of regeneration and the *renewing of the Holy Spirit,* which he poured on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior; that being justified by his favor, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.' Thus, and not by works of righteousness, he has saved us. Consequently, being born of water and the renewing of the Holy Spirit  are  not  works  of  merit  or  of  righteousness,  but  only  the means of enjoyment. But this pouring out of the influences, this renewing  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  is  as  necessary  as  the  bath  of regeneration to the salvation of the soul, and to the enjoyment of the hope of heaven, of which the Apostle speaks. In the kingdom into  which  we  are  born  of  water,  the  Holy  Spirit  is  as  the atmosphere in the kingdom of nature — we mean that the influences of  the  Holy  Spirit  are  as  necessary  to  *the  new  life,*  as  the atmosphere is to our animal life in the kingdom of nature. All that is done in us before regeneration, God our Father effects by *the word,* or the gospel as dictated and confirmed by his Holy Spirit. But after we are thus begotten and born by the Spirit of God — after our new birth — the Holy Spirit is shed on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior; of which the peace of mind, the love, the joy, and the hope of the regenerate is full proof; for these are amongst the fruits of that the Holy Spirit of promise of which we speak. Thus commences (The next chapter) 

3. The New Life 

'*Newness of life*' is a Hebraism for a *new life.* The new birth brings us into a new state. 'Old things have passed away; all things have become new,' says an Apostle: 'for if any one be in Christ, he is a new creature.' A new spirit, a new heart, and an outward character, corresponding to this change, are the effects of the regenerating process:  'for  the  end  of  the  change,'  the  grand  results  of  the remedial system, is 'love out of a pure heart, a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.' 'Love is the fulfilling of the whole law,' and the  fruit  of  the  whole gospel.  It  is  the  cardinal  principle  of  all Christian behavior, the soul of the new man, the breath of the new life. Faith works by no other rule. It is a working principle, and love is the rule by which it operates. The Spirit of God is the spirit of love and the health of a sound mind. Every pulsation of the new heart is the impulse of the spirit of love. Hence the brotherhood is beloved, and all mankind embraced in unbounded good will. When the tongue speaks, the hands and the feet move and operate under the unrestrained guidance of this principle, we have the Christian character  drawn  to  the  life.  For  meekness,  humility,  mercy, sympathy,  and  active  benevolence,  are  only  the  names  of  the various workings of this all-renovating, invigorating, sanctifying, and happifying principle. 'He that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him.' 

The  Christian,  or  the  new  man,  is  then  a  philanthropist  to  the utmost extent of the meaning of that word. Truth and love have made him free from all the tyrannies of passion, from guilt, and fear and shame; have filled him with courage, active and passive. Therefore, his enterprise, his capital enterprise, to which all others minister, is to take part with our Savior in the salvation of the world. 'If by any means I may save some,' are not the words of Paul only, but of every *new man.* Are they merchants, mechanics, husbandmen? — are they magistrates, lawyers, judges, or unofficial citizens? — are  they  masters,  servants,  fathers,  sons,  brothers, neighbors? — whatever, or wherever they may be, they live for God and his city, for the King and his empire. They associate not with the children of wrath — the miser, the selfish, the prodigal, the gay, the  proud,  the  slanderer,  the  tattler,  the  rake,  the  libertine,  the drunkard, the thief, the murderer. Every new man has left these precincts; has broken his league with Satan and his slaves, and has joined  himself  to  the  family  of  God.  These  he  complacently loves — those he pities — and does good to all. 

The character of the new man is an elevated character. Feeling himself a son and an heir of God, he cultivates the temper, spirit, and behavior, which corresponds with so exalted a relation. He despises every thing mean, grovelling, earthly, sensual, devilish. As the only begotten and well beloved Son of God is to be the model of his future personal glory, so the character which Jesus sustained amongst men, is the model of his daily imitation. His everyday aspiration is —  

- Thy fair example will I trace, 

To teach me what I ought to be; Make me by thy transforming grace, Lord Jesus, daily more like thee." 

The law of God is hid in his heart. The living oracles dwell in his mind;  and  he  grows  in  favor  with  God  as  he  grows  in  the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ his Lord. As a new born babe he desires the unadulterated milk of the word of God, that he may grow by it; for as the thirsty hart pants after the brooks of water, so pants his soul after God. Thus he lives to God, and walks with him. This is the character of the regenerate — of him that is born of God — of the new man in Christ Jesus. This is the change of heart, of life, and of character, which is the tendency and the fruit of the process of regeneration, as taught and exemplified by the Apostles, and those commended by God, in their writings. 

We now proceed to offer a few remarks on physical regeneration, the second part of our subject.  

4. Physical Regeneration ****

Our mortal bodies are yet to feel the regenerating power of the son of God. This is emphatically called '*the glory of his power.*' 'The redemption of the body' from the bondage of corruption, is the consummation  of  the  new  creating  energy  of  him  who  has immortality. Life and incorruptibility were displayed in and by his resurrection from the dead. It was great to create man in the image of God — greater to redeem his soul from general corruption; but greater  of  all,  to  give  to  his  mortal  frame  incorruptible  and immortal  vigor. The power displayed in  the  giving to  the dead body of the Son of God incorruptible glory and endless life, is set forth by the Apostle Paul, as incomparably surpassing every other divine work within the reach of human knowledge. He prays that the mind of Christians may be enlarged to apprehend this mighty power — that the Father of glory would open their minds, 'that they might know the exceeding greatness of his power in relation to us who believe — according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.' Faith in this wonderful operation of God — hope for the riches of the glory of the inheritance  of  the  saints  in  light,  are  in  the  most  powerful principles of action,  which God has  ever planted in  the human breast. This is the transcendent hope of the Christian calling, which imparted such heroic courage to all the saints of eternal renown. This  better resurrection in  prospect,  has produced heroes which make cowards of all the boasted chiefs of worldly glory. As the magnetic needle ever points to the pole, so the mind, influenced by this hope, ever rises to the skies, and terminates in the fulness of joy, and the pleasures for evermore, in the presence and at the right hand of God. 

To raise a dead body to life again, is not set forth as more glorious, than by a touch to give new vigor to the palsied arm, to impart sight to the blind, or hearing to the deaf; but to give that raised body  the  deathless  vigor  of  incorruptibility,  to  renovate  and transform it in all its parts, and to make every spirit feel that it reanimates its own body, that it is as insusceptible of decay, as immortal as the Father of eternity, is a thought overwhelming to every mind, a development which will glorify the power of God, as the  sacrifice  of  his  Son  now  displays  his  righteousness, faithfulness, and love to the heavens and to the earth. 

This new birth from the dark prison of the grave, is fitly styled 'the redemption of the body' from bondage, '*the glorious liberty of the sons of God.*' As in our watery grave the old man is figuratively buried to rise no more, so in the literal grave, the prison of the body, we leave all that is corrupt; for he that makes all things new, will  raise  us  up in  his own  likeness,  and  present  us  before  his Father's face in all the glory of immortality. Then will regeneration be complete. Then will be the full revelation of the sons of God. 

Immortality, in the sacred writings, is never applied to the spirit of man. It is not the doctrine of Plato which the resurrection of Jesus proposes. It is the *immortality of the body* of which his resurrection is a proof and pledge. This was never developed till he became the first born from the dead, and in a human body entered the heavens. Jesus was not a spirit when he returned to God. He is not made the Head of the New Creation as a Spirit, but as the Son of Man. Our nature  in  his  person  is  glorified;  and  when  he  appears  to  our salvation, we shall be made like him: we shall see him as he is. This is the Christian hope. 

- A hope so great and so divine  

`  `May trials well endure,  

`  `And purge the soul from sense and sin,    As Christ himself is pure."  

` `Thus matters stand in the economy of redemption. Thus the divine scheme of regeneration is consummated: the moral part, by the operation of moral means; the physical part, by the mighty power of  God  operating  through  physical  means.  By  the  word  of  his power he created the heavens and the earth; by the word of his grace he reanimates the soul of man; and by the word of his power he will again form our bodies anew, and reunite the spirit and the body in the bonds of an incorruptible and everlasting union. Then shall death  "be swallowed up forever" "*Where now thy victory, boasting grave?*" But for this we must wait. 'We know not what we shall be.' We only know, that when he appears, we shall be like him; that we shall see him as he is.  

5. The Use of the Theory of Regeneration 

   One would imagine, from the voluminous arguments, debates, and sermons upon the theory of regeneration, that a sound theory was essential to salvation: that it must be preached in every sermon, in order to regenerate the hearers. Nothing can be more preposterous. Who can think that any theory of the resurrection or regeneration of the body can affect the body in the grave! As little can any theory affect the unregenerate, or those dead in trespasses and in sins. A sermon upon generation, or upon natural birth, would be as efficacious upon those unborn, in bringing them into this life, as a sermon  upon  moral  or  physical  regeneration.  This  explains  the fact, that in all the accounts of apostolical preaching to Jew and Gentile — in all the extracts of their sermons and speeches found in the  New  Testament,  the  subject  of  regeneration  is  not  once mentioned. It is, in all the historic books of the New Testament, but once propounded, but once named; and that only in a private conference  with  a  Jewish  Senator,  on  the  affairs  of  Christ's kingdom. No theory understood or believed by the unregenerate; no theory proposed to them for their acceptance, can avail anything to their regeneration. We might as reasonably deliver a theory of digestion  to  a  dyspeptic,  to  cure  his  stomach — or  a  theory  of vegetation to a scion, to hasten its growth, as to preach any view of regeneration to a sinner, to make him a Christian. 

Of what use, then, are the previous remarks on this subject? I will first candidly inform the reader, that they were not written for his regeneration, either of mind or body; but the benefit of those who are  employed  in  the  work  of  regenerating  others,  and  for  the conviction of such Christians as may have been induced to regard us as aiming at nothing, but the mere immersion of persons, as alone  necessary  to  the  whole  process  of  conversion  or regeneration, in their acceptation of the words.12 The use of this 

theory, if it have any, is, as a guide to those who are laboring publicly or privately for the regeneration of sinners. If we have assigned a proper place to facts, testimony, faith, feeling, action, the bath of regeneration, the renewing of the Holy Spirit, and a new life, the course is fairly marked out. They are to present the great facts, to declare the whole testimony of God to sinners, in order to their conversion or regeneration. Like Paul, in his account of his labors in Corinth, they must go out, not in the strength of human philosophy, '*but declaring the testimony of God,*' and laying before their hearers 'the wonderful works of God.' 

This is the use, and the only proper use of sound theory on any subject. It is to guide the operator, not the thing operated on. I would  hope,  under  the  Divine  blessing,  to  be  the  means  of regenerating  more  persons  in  one  year,  never  once  naming regeneration,  nor  speculating  upon  the  subject,  by  stating  and enforcing the testimony of God, than by preaching daily the most approved theory of regeneration ever sanctioned by any sanhedrim on earth.13 With these views, we have, then, offered the preceding 

remarks;  and  shall  now  briefly  turn  our  attention  to  (the  next chapter) 

6. The Regeneration of the Church ****

   The word *regeneration,* we have found once used in the sense of a new  state  of  things,  or  of  the  introduction  of  a  new  state  of things.14  In  this  application  of  the  word,  we  would  turn  the 

attention of our readers to the necessity of the regeneration of the church. 

I  speak  not  of  the  regeneration  of  any  sectarian  establishment. They are built upon another foundation — upon the foundation of decrees of councils, creeds, formularies, or acts of Parliament. But we  speak  of  those  societies  that  professedly  build  upon  the foundation of Apostles and Prophets, without any human bond of union,  or  rule  of  life — our  brethren  of  the  reformation,  or regeneration, now in process. 

Should any one imagine that the state of things to which we have attained, is the sole, or ultimate object of our aspirations or our efforts, he would do us the greatest injury. Societies, indeed, may be found amongst us, far in advance of others, in their progress towards the ancient order of things; but we know of none that has fully attained to that model. It is, however, most acceptable to see so  many  societies  formed  and  forming,  under  the  banners  of reformation,  with  the  determination  to  move  onwards  in conformity  to  the  sacred  oracles,  till  they  stand  perfect  and complete in all the will of God. 

Our opponents cannot, or will not, understand how any society can be in progress to a better order of things, than that under which they  may  have  commenced  their  pilgrimage.  Their  sectarian policies were soon formed, and the limits of their reformation were soon fixed; beyond which it soon became heretical to move. The founders of all new schisms not only saw through a glass darkly, but their horizon was so circumscribed with human traditions, that they only aimed at moving a few paces from the hive in which they were generated. A new creed was soon adopted, and then their stature was complete. They bounded from infancy to manhood in a few days, and decided, if any presumed farther to advance, they should be treated as those who had refused to move from the old hive.  Hence  it  became  as  censurable  to  grow  beyond  a  certain standard, as not to grow at all. This never was our proposition, and never can be our object. We have no new creed to form, no rules of discipline to adopt. We have taken the Living Oracles as our creed, our  rules  and  measures  of  faith  and  practice;  and  in  this department,  have  no  additions,  alterations,  nor  amendments  to propose. But in coming up to this standard of knowledge, faith, and behavior, we have something yet before us, to which we have not attained. 

That  we may be distinctly understood on this subject,  we shall speak  particularly  on  the  things  wanting  in  our  individual characters, and of the things wanting in our church order, to give to our meetings that interest and influence which they ought to exert on the brotherhood and on society at large. 

It will be understood, that our remarks on the things which are wanting in the disciples, are applicable not to every individual, but to  the  general  mass.  And  first  of  all,  there  is  wanting  a  more general and particular knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, than is possessed by a great majority of the reformers. There is, perhaps, wanting a taste or disposition for that private devotional reading of the  oracles  of  God,  which  is  essential  to  a  growth  in  that knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ, which constitutes the most striking attributes in Christian character. We thus reason from the proficiency  which  is  discoverable  in  the  bounds  of  our acquaintance,  which  is  large  enough  to  afford  data  for  every general conclusion.  

To read the Scriptures for the sake of carrying out into practice all that we learn, and to read them for the sake of knowing what is written, are very different objects, and will produce very different results. Their influence on the temper and behavior, in the former case,  will  very  soon  become  manifest  to  all  with  whom  we associate; while, in the latter case, there is no visible improvement. David said that he 'hid the word of God in his heart,' or laid it up in his mind, 'that he might not sin against God;' and that he had 'more understanding  than  all  his  teachers,  because  God's  testimonies were his meditation.' It will be admitted that the sacred writings of the  Apostles  and  Evangelists  of  Jesus  Christ  ought  to  be  as precious  and  as  delightful  to  the Christian,  as  were the  ancient oracles to the most pious Jews. Now as an example of what we mean by a private devotional reading and study of the oracles of Christ, we shall permit a Jew to tell his experience: —  

'The law of thy mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver. With my whole heart have I sought thee; my soul breaketh for  the  longing  that  it  has  to  thy  judgments  at  all  times.  Thy testimonies are my delight and my counsellors. Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes, and I will keep it to the end. Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yes, I will observe it with my whole heart. Make me to go in the path of thy commandments, for in it do I delight. Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. At midnight I will rise to give thanks to thee, because of thy righteous judgments. Oh, how I love thy law; it is my meditation all the day! How sweet are thy words to my taste; sweeter than honey to my mouth! Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever, for they are the rejoicing of my heart. Great peace have they that love thy law — nothing shall cause them to stumble.' 

These are only a few extracts from one piece, written by a king three thousand years ago. One another occasion he pronounced the following encomium on the testimony of God: —  

'The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple: the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever;  the  judgments  of  the  Lord  are  true  and  righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold — yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey, and the honey-comb. By them is  thy  servant  warned,  and  in  keeping  of  them  there  is  great reward.' 

This fully reveals all that we mean by a devotional private study of the Holy Scriptures. Every Christian who can read, may every day thus  refresh,  strengthen,  and  comfort  his  heart,  by  reading  or committing  to  memory,  and  afterwards  reflecting  upon  some portion  of  the  book.  He  may  carry  in  his  pocket  the  blessed volume, and many a time through the day take a peep into it. This will preserve him from  temptation, impart courage to his heart, give fluency to his tongue, and the graces of Christianity to his life. 

In  this  age,  when  ignorance  of  the  Christian  Scriptures  is  so characteristic, and the rage for human opinions and traditions so rampant, it is a duty doubly imperative on our brethren, to give themselves much more to the study of the book; and then one of them will put a host of aliens to flight; and, what is still more desirable, he will have communion with God all the day, and ever rejoice in his salvation. 

In the second place, there is wanting among disciples, who are heads of families, more attention, much more effort, to bring up their children 'in the correction and instruction of the Lord.' The children of all disciplines should be taught the oracles of God from the first dawning of reason. The good seed should be sown in their hearts, before the strong seeds of vice can take root. *From a child* Timothy knew the Holy Scriptures, and they were able to make him wise to salvation, through the Christian faith. How many more Timothies might we have, if we had a few more of the daughters of Lois, and a few more mothers like Eunice! Most saints, in this generation, appear more zealous that their children should shine on earth, than in heaven — and that they may be rich here, at the hazard of eternal bankruptcy. They labor to make them rich and genteel, rather than pure and holy; and spend more time in fashioning them to the foolish and wicked taste of *polished* society, than in teaching them by precept and example, the word that is better than gold and more precious than rubies. Well, they sow darnel, and cannot reap wheat. They may have a mournful harvest, and years of bitterness and sorrow may reward them for their negligence and error. If only a tithe of the time, and the labor, and expense that it costs to fit a son or a daughter to shine in the middle or front ranks of *genteel* society, were spent in teaching them to fear God and to keep his commandments,  how  many  more  virtuous,  solid,  and  useful citizens — how  many  more  valuable  members  of  the  family  of God — how many more faithful and able witnesses for the truth of God, would be found in all corners of the land! 

Every  Christian  family  ought  to  be  a  nursery  for  God.  Their offspring should be trained for the skies. For such are the promises of God, such are the facts on record, and such is the experience of Christians, that every parent who does his duty to his children may expect to see them inherit the blessing. Their didactic labors, aided by their example and their constant prayers, will seldom or never fail of success in influencing their descendants to walk in their ways. The very command to bring up their children in the Lord, implies its practicability. And both Testaments furnish us with all assurance that such labors will not be in vain. The men of high renown  in  sacred  history,  were  generally  the  sons  of  such parentage. The sons of God were found among the sons of Seth, while the daughters of men were of the progeny of Cain. Abraham was the descendant of Shem; Moses and Aaron were the sons of believing parents; Samuel was the son of Hannah, and David was the son of Jesse. John the harbinger was the son of Zachariah and Elizabeth; and it pleased the heavenly father, that his Son should be the child of a pious virgin. 

But it is under Christ that the faithful are furnished with all the necessary means of bringing up their offspring for the Lord. The numerous failures which we witness, are to be traced either to great neglect, or to some fatal notion which paralyzes all effort; for some think  that  the  salvation  or  damnation  of  their  offspring  was  a matter settled for all eternity, irrespective of any agency on their part: that some are born 'vessels of wrath,' and other 'vessels of mercy;'  and  hence  the  instructions,  examples,  and  prayers  of parents are of no avail. Among the descendents of such, it will no doubt  often  happen  that  *become*  vessels  of  wrath  fitted  for destruction, while others *become* vessels of mercy, predestinated to glory. 

When God gave a revelation to Jacob, and commanded a law to Israel,  he  gave  it  in  charge  that  they  should  'teach  it  to  their children, that they might *put their trust in God,* and might not be, like their fathers, a rebellious race.' The Apostles of Christ have also taught the Christians the same lesson. This is our guide, and not  our  own  reasonings.  Now  let  the  disciples  make  this  their business, morning, noon, and evening, and then we shall see its effects. 

We  are  sorry  to  see  this  great  duty,  to  which  nature,  reason, revelation  alike  direct,  so  much  neglected  by  many  of  our brethren — to find amongst their children those who are no better acquainted with the Scriptures than the children of their neighbors, who  believe  in  miraculous  conversions,  or  think  it  is  a  sin  to attempt what they imagine to be the work of God alone — never suspecting that God works by human means, and employs human agency in his works of providence and redemption. 

I  never  knew  but  a  very  few  families  that  made  it  their  daily business to train up their children in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, to cause them every day to commit to memory a portion of the living oracles; but these few instances authorize me to think, and to say, that such a course persisted in, and sustained by the good example of parents, will very generally, if not universally, issue in the salvation of their children. And before any one says, I have found an exception to the proverbs of Solomon, which says, 'Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it,' — let him show that this child was '*trained up in the way he should go.*' 

In the third place, there is wanting among the disciples, a stricter regard  to  relative  duties — we  mean,  not  only  the  duties  which justice, truth, and moderation claim; but *all* relative duties. So long as Christians live after the manner of men in the flesh, according to the fashion of this world, they must, like other men, contract debts which they cannot promptly pay, make covenants and bargains, give promises which they cannot fulfil, and stake pledges which they are unable to redeem. All this is wholly incompatible with our profession. Such were not the primitive disciples. Sceptics of every name, men of the world, who have ever read the New Testament, know that such behavior is utterly incompatible with the letter and spirit of Christianity. A Christian's word or promise ought to be, and is, if Christ be honored, as solemn and obligatory as any bond. And as for breach of bargain or covenant, even where it is greatly or wholly to the disadvantage of the Christians, it is not even to be thought of — 'he changes not, though to his hurt he covenants.' How much  has  the  gospel  lost  of  its  influence,  because  of  the faithlessness of its professors! O! when shall it be again said of Christians in general, that 'they bind themselves, as with a solemn oath, not to commit any kind of wickedness — to be guilty neither of theft, robbery, nor adultery — *never to break a promise,* or to keep back  a  deposit  when  called  upon.'  Pliny  writes  to  the  Emperor Trajan that such was the character of Christians A. D. 106-7, as far as he could learn it from those who were not Christians. Were all the  common  (now-a-days  rather  *uncommon*)  virtues  of  justice, truth,  fidelity,  honesty,  practiced  by  all  Christians,  how  many mouths would be stopped, and how many new arguments in favor of Jesus Christ could all parties find! But even were these common virtues as general as the Christian profession, there are the other finer virtues of benevolence, goodness, mercy, sympathy, which belong to the profession, expressed in taking care of the sick, the orphan,  the  widow — in  alleviating  all  the  afflictions  of  our fellow-creatures. Add these virtues, or *graces,* as we sometimes call them, to the others, and then how irresistible the argument for the  divine  authenticity  of  the  gospel!  Let  industry,  frugality, temperance,  honesty,  justice,  truth,  fidelity,  humility,  mercy, sympathy, appear conspicuous in the lives of the disciples, and the contrast between them and other professors will plead their cause more successfully than a hundred preachers. 

In the last place, there is wanting a more elevated piety to bring up the Christian character to the standard of primitive times. We want not  fine  speeches  nor  eloquent  orations  on  the  excellencies  of Christian piety and devotion. These are generally acknowledged. But  we  need  to  be  roused  from  our  supineness,  from  our worldly-mindedness, from our sinful conformities to an apostate generation, to the exhibition of that holiness in speech, in behavior, without which no one shall see the Lord. What mean the numerous exhortations of the Apostles to watchfulness and prayer, if these are not essential to our devotion to God and consecration to his service? 

If our affections are not placed on things above, we are unfit for the  kingdom  of  glory.  To  see  the  folly  of  a  profession  of Christianity without the power of godliness, we have only to put the question, How is that person fit for the enjoyment of God and Christ, whose heart is filled with the cares, anxieties, and concerns of this life — whose whole life is a life of labor and care for the body — a life of devotion to the objects of time and sense? No man can serve God and Mammon. Where the treasure is, the heart must also be. Thither the affections turn their course. There is no room for the residence of the Spirit of God in a mind devoted to the affairs of this life. The spirit of the policies of this world, and the Spirit  of  God,  cannot  dwell  in  the  same  heart.  If  Jesus  or  his Apostles taught any one doctrine clearly, fully, and unequivocally, it is this doctrine, that 'the cares of this world, the lusts of other things, and the deceitfulness of riches, stifle the word, and render it unfruitful.' 

If any one would enjoy the power of godliness, he must give up his whole  soul  to  it.  The  business  of  this  life  will  be  performed religiously, as a duty subordinate to the will of God. While his hands are engaged in that business which his own wants, or those of  his  household  make  necessary,  his  affections  are  above.  He delights in God, and communes with him all the day. A Christian is not one who is pious by fits and starts, who is religious or devout one day of the week, or for one hour of the day. It is the whole bent of his soul — it is the beginning, middle, and end of every day. To make his calling and election sure, is the business of his life. His mind rests only in God. He places the Lord always before him. This is his joy and delight. He would not for the world have it otherwise.  He  would  not  enjoy  eternal  life,  if  he  had  it  at  his option,  in  any  other  way  than  that  which  God  himself  has proposed. He accedes to God's arrangements, not of necessity, but of choice. His religious services are perfect freedom. He is free indeed. The Lord's commandments are not grievous, but joyful. The yoke of Christ to him is easy, and his burthen light. He will sing, with David —  

`  `The love that to thy laws I bear,  

`  `No language can display;  

`  `They with fresh wonders entertain    My ravish'd thoughts all day.  

`  `The law that from thy mouth proceeds,  

`  `Of more esteem I hold,  

`  `Than untouch'd stores, than thousand mines    Of silver and of gold.  

`  `Whilst in the way of thy commands,    More solid joy I found,  

`  `Than had I been with vast increase    Of envied riches crown'd.  

`  `Thy testimonies I have kept,  

`  `And constantly obey'd;  

`  `Because the love I bore to them    Thy service easy made.  

` `In the same ratio as Christians devoutly study the oracles of God, teach them to their children, practice all relative duties to society at large, and rise to a more elevated piety, they will increase their influence in the great and heavenly work of regenerating the world. 

A few remarks  on the  things  wanting in  the order of Christian assemblies,  to  give  to  their  public  meetings  that  influence  on themselves and on society at large, will finish this section of our essay. 

Our heavenly Father wills our happiness in all its institutions. His ordinances are, therefore, the surest,  the simplest, and the most direct  means of promoting our  happiness. The  Lord Jesus  gave himself  for  the  church  that  he  might  purify  and  bless  it;  and, therefore, in the church are all the institutions which can promote the  individual  and  social  good  of  the  Christian  community.  In attending upon these institutions on the Lord's day, much depends upon the preparation of heart in all who unite to commemorate the death and resurrection of the Son of God. 

In  adverting  to  the  most  scriptural  and  rational  manner  of celebrating or observing the day of the Lord, both for their own comfort and the regeneration of the world, we would first of all remark, that much depends upon the frame of mind, or preparation of heart, in which we visit the assemblies of the saints. 

Suppose two persons, A and B, if you please, members of the same church, take their seats together at the Lord's table. A, from the time  he  opened  his  eyes  in  the  morning,  was  filled  with  the recollections  of  the  Savior's  life,  death,  and  resurrection.  In  his closet,  in  his  family,  and  along  the  way,  he  was  meditating  or conversing  on  the  wonders  of  redemption,  and  renewing  his recollections of the sayings and doings of the Messiah. B, on the other hand, arose as on other days, and finding himself free from all obligations arising from the holiness of the time, talks about the common affairs of every day, and allows his thoughts to roam over the business of the last week, or, perhaps, to project the business of the next. If he meet with a neighbor, friend, or brother, the news of the day is inquired after, expatiated upon, discussed; the crops, the markets, the public health, or the weather — the affairs of Europe, or the doings of Congress, or the prospects of some candidate for political honor — become the theme of conversation. As he rides or walks to the church, he chats upon all, or any of these topics, till he enter the door of the meeting house. Now, as A and B enter the house in very different states of mind, may it not be supposed that they will differ as much in their enjoyments, as in their morning thoughts? Or can B, by a single effort, unburthen his mind, call in the wanderings of his thoughts, and in a moment transport himself from the contemplation of things on earth to things in heaven? If this can be imagined, then meditation and preparation of heart are wholly unnecessary to the acceptable worship of God, and to the comfortable enjoyment of his institutions. 

But is it compatible with experience, or is it accordant to reason, that  B  can  delight  in  God,  and  rejoice  in  commemorating  the wonders of redemption, while his thoughts are dissipated upon the mountains of a thousand vanities? — while, like a fool's eyes, his thoughts are roaming to the ends of the earth? Can he say, with a pious Jew, 'How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! My soul longs — yes, even faints, for the courts of the Lord! My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. Happy they who dwell in thy house; they will be still praising thee! A day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.' — 'One thing have I desired of the Lord, and that I will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. O send out thy light and thy truth! Let them lead me, let them bring me to thy holy hill and to thy tabernacles. Then will I go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy; yes, I will praise thee, O God, my God!' 

Or had the Jew a sublimer worship, more exalted views of God's salvation, and more piety, than a Christian? Or were the ordinances of the Jewish sanctuary more entertaining and refreshing than the ordinances  of  the  Christian  church?  This  will  not  be  alleged; consequently, B, and all of that school, are utterly at fault when they approach the house of God, in such a state of mind as they approach the market place, the forum, or the common resorts of this present world. 

Christians need not say, in excuse for themselves, that all days are alike, that all places and times are alike holy, and that they ought to be in the best frame of mind all the time. For even concede them all their own positions, they will not contend that a man ought to speak  to  God,  or  to  come  into  the  presence  of  God,  as  they approach men. They will not say that they ought to have the same thoughts  or  feelings  in  approaching  the  Lord's  table,  as  in approaching a common table; or on entering a court of political justice, as in coming into the house of God. There is, in the words of Solomon the Wise, a season and time for every object and for every work: There is the Lord's day, the Lord's table, the Lord's house, and the Lord's people; and there are thoughts, and frames of mind, and behavior compatible and incompatible with all these. In the public assembly the whole order of worship ought to do justice to what is passing in the minds of all the worshippers. That joy in the Lord, that peace and serenity of mind, that affection of the  brethren,  that  reverence  for  the  institutions  of  God's  house, which all feel, should be manifest in all the business of the day. Nothing that would do injustice to all or any of these ought ever to appear in the congregation of Jesus Christ our Lord. No levity, irreverence, no gloom, no sadness, no pride, no unkindness, no severity of behavior towards any, no coldness, nothing but love, and peace, and joy, humility, and reverence, should appear in the face, in the word, or action of any disciple. 

These are not little matters. They all exert a salutary influence on the  brethren  and  the  strangers.  These  are  visible  and  sensible displays of the temper and spirit of Christians; and if Paul thought it expedient to write of *veils* and *long hair* when admonishing a church "to do all things decently and in order," we, in this day of degeneracy, may be allowed to notice matters and things as minute as those before us. 

We intend not now to go into details of church order or Christian discipline, nor to expatiate on the necessity of devoting a part of the  time  to  singing,  praying,  reading,  teaching,  exhorting, commemorating, communicating; nor on how much of this or that is  expedient.  Times  and  circumstances,  must  decide  how  much time shall be taken up in these exercises, and when it shall be most fitting to meet, to adjourn, etc. Nor is it necessary now to say, that there  must  be  scriptural  order,  and  presidency,  and  proper discipline, and due subordination to one another in the fear of God. We now speak rather of the *manner* in which all things are to be done, and of the things themselves, their necessity or value.  

After noticing what in some instances appear to be wanting in the manner of coming together on the Lord's day, we proceed to notice in  order  the  things  wanting  in  many  congregations,  for  the purposes already specified. 

And first of all, be it observed, that in some churches there appears to be wanting *a proper method of handling the Scriptures, to the edification of the brethren.* It is admitted by all the holy brethren, that the Scriptures of truth, called *the living oracles,* are the great instrument  of  God  for  all  his  purposes  in  the  saints  on  earth. Through them they are converted to God, comforted, consecrated, made meet for an inheritance among the sanctified, and qualified for every good word and work. Every thing, then, depends upon the proper understanding of these volumes of inspiration. They can only operate as far as they are understood. 

The system of sermonizing on a text is now almost universally abandoned, by all who intend that their hearers should understand the testimony of God. Orators and exhorters may select a word, a phrase,  or  a  verse;  but  all  who  feed  the  flock  of  God  with knowledge and understanding, know that this method is  wholly absurd. Philological lectures upon a chapter are only a little better. The discussion of any particular topic, such as faith, repentance, election, the Christian calling, may sometimes be expedient: but in a  congregation  of  Christians,  the  reading  and  examining  the different  books  in  regular  succession,  every  disciple  having  the volume  in  his  hand,  following  up  the  connection  of  things, examining parallel passages, interrogating and being interrogated, fixing the meaning of particular words and phrases, by comparison with  the  style  of  that  writer  or  speaker,  or  with  that  of  others; intermingling these exercises with prayer and praises, and keeping the narrative, the epistle, the speech, so long as before the minds of all, as is necessary for the youngest disciple in the congregation to understand it, and to become deeply interested in it, will do more in  one  year,  than  is  done  in  many,  on  the  plan  of  the  popular meetings of the day. 

Great attention should be paid to all allusions, in any composition, to  the  particularities  of  time,  place,  and  circumstance,  to  the geographical,  historical,  and  chronological  particulars  of  all questions  of  fact  connected  with  all  persons  of  note  in  the narratives: for these are often the best interpreters of style, and expositors of the meaning of what is written.  

This searching, examining, comparing, and ruminating upon the Holy  Scriptures  in  private,  in  the  family,  in  the  congregation, cannot fail to make us learned in the knowledge of God, and in the knowledge of man. The Bible contains more real learning than all the  volumes  of  men.  It  instructs  us  in  all  our  natural,  moral, political,  and  religious  relations.  Though  it  teaches  us  not astronomy,  medicine,  chemistry,  mathematics,  architecture,  it gives us all that knowledge which adorns and dignifies our moral nature, and fits us for happiness. Happy the person who meditates upon it day and night! He grows and flourishes in moral health and vigor, as the trees upon the water courses. His leaf never fades — his fruit never fails. 

The  congregations  of  the  saints  want  system  in  furthering  the knowledge of this book. The simple reading of large portions in a desultory manner, is not without some good effect; for there is light, and majesty, and life, in all the oracles of God; no man can listen  to  them  without edification.  But  the  profit  accruing  from such readings, is not a tithe of that which might be obtained in the proper  systematic  reading  and  examination  of  them.  The congregation is the school of Christ, and every pupil there should feel that he has learned something every day he waits upon his Master. He must take the Master's book with him, and, like every other good and orderly pupil, he must open it and study it, with all the helps that the brotherhood, his school-fellows, can furnish for his  more  comprehensive  knowledge  of  all  its  salutary communications. 

A Christian scribe, well instructed in its contents, or a plurality of such, who can bring out of their intellectual treasury things new and old, will greatly advance the students in this heavenly science; but, in the absence of such, the students must be self-taught; and self-taught scholars are generally the best taught: for they cannot progress, unless they study with diligence, and carefully learn the rudiments of every science. 

To give some idea of the diligence and attention to the minutest matters, which are necessary to proficiency in the knowledge of all that is written in the New Testament, we shall suppose that the disciples have for their lesson, on some particular day, the Nativity of  the  Messiah.  The  second  chapter  of  Matthew  is  read.  After reading this chapter, or the whole of the first section of Matthew's Testimony, the elder or president for the day asks some brother, a good reader, to read what the other evangelists have testified on this subject. Mark and John being silent on the nativity, he reads Luke 2d chapter, from the 1st to the 41st verse. After the reading of this chapter, the following points are the subject of inquiry, and most of them are proposed to the brethren for solution: —  

1. Who was  Cesar Augustus,  and over what  people did  he reign?  
1. At  what  period  of  his  reign  was  the  edict  of  enrolment issued, or when did the first register take effect?  
1. What did Syria include, and what were its boundaries?  
1. Who presided over Syria at the time of the first register?  
1. Who was king in Judea at this time?  
1. How far did Judea extend, or in what part of the Holy Land was it situated?  
1. In  what  country  was  Jerusalem,  where  situated,  and  by what other names was it known?  
1. What was the native city of Joseph?  
1. Where was Nazareth situated, and in what district?  
1. What  was  the  boundary  of  Galilee,  and  what  were  its principal towns?  
1. In what canton or district was Bethlehem, and how far from Jerusalem?  
1. Who were the magians?  
1. Why  was  'Herod  alarmed,  and  all  Jerusalem  with  him,' when the magians reported the Star in the East?  
1. What  were  the  scribes  and  chief  priests  assembled  by Herod, and why were they called together?  
15. By what means did they decide the questions referred to them?  
15. On  what  Prophet  do  they  rely,  and  where  shall  the quotation be found?  
15. Of what family and lineage were Joseph and Mary?  
15. By what means did the magians find the house in which the Messiah was born?  
15. Why did the magians not return to Herod?  
15. Whether  did  the  shepherds  of  Bethlehem,  or  the  eastern magians, first pay their respects to the Messiah?  
15. In what quarter of the globe does Egypt lie?  
15. How far from Bethlehem?  
15. How long was the Messiah kept in Egypt?  
15. Who predicted his return from Egypt, and where shall it be found?  
15. Who  foretold  the  slaughter  of  the  male  infants  in Bethlehem,  and  what  instigated  Herod  to  this  cruel massacre?  
15. Who succeeded Herod in the throne of Judea?  
15. Why did Joseph retire to Nazareth?  
15. What Prophet foretold this circumstance, and where shall it be found? 

These  matters  being  all  ascertained,  to  which  the  maps, geographical and chronological indexes, and the appendix to the Family Testament, will greatly contribute, some moral reflections will  naturally  occur;  for  in  all  these  incidents  are  manifest  the wisdom,  care,  and  economy  of  our  heavenly  Father,  his faithfulness,  condescension,  and  love;  the  great  variety  of  his instruments, and agents; the ease with which he frustrates the evil counsels and machinations of his enemies; the infallible certainty of his foreknowledge; the perfect free agency of men, good and evil;  the  deep  humiliation  of  his  only-begotten  Son  in  all  the circumstances of his nativity. Irresistible arguments in favor for his pretensions  may  be  drawn  from  these  ancient  prophecies,  from their minuteness of time, place, and circumstance; many eloquent and powerful lessons on human pride, vanity, and arrogance may be deduced from the birth-place, cradle, and family connections of the Heir of the Universe; and many other touching appeals to the heart, which the birth, circumcision, and dedication of the Messiah, with all the incidents in Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and the Temple, connected with his first appearance on earth furnish, will present themselves, with unfading freshness and beauty, to the brotherhood of Christ. 

A hint to the wise is sufficient. Were this method pursued only two hours every Lord's day, every disciple giving his heart to the work; and were the results then compared with the products of the scrap Doctors or sermonizers to sleeping and dreaming hearers, no man, having any regard for his reputation for good sense, could give his vote for the popular system. 

A reformation in the manner of handling the living oracles is much wanting; and the sooner and more generally it is attempted, the greater will be the regenerating influence of the brotherhood on the world. Intelligent in the Holy Scriptures, clothed with the armor of light,  every  disciple  going  forth  will  be  a  David  against  the Philistines — a host against the armies of the aliens. And better still, the words of heavenly favor dwelling in his heart, he will carry with him into every society a fragrance like the rose of Sharon — a sweetness of perfume like a garden which the Lord has blessed. 

There  appears  to  be  wanting  in  some  congregations  a  proper attention  to  discipline,  and  a  due  regard  to  decorum,  in  the management of such cases as occur. In every family, and in every congregation,  there  is  occasional  need  of  discipline.  Offences, delinquencies, and apostacies, did occur in the congregations over which the apostles either were, or had been, presidents; and they will happen again in this state of discipline and trial, in which we are  all  placed.  They  must  be  expected;  and  every  congregation ought to be prepared to act upon the emergency with intelligence and  decorum.  Much  injury  has  been  done  to  the  progress  of churches,  by  a  remission  in  attention  to  such  cases,  and  in  the manner they have been disposed of when taken up. 

Nothing can be more preposterous and revolting to every sentiment of good order and decorum, than that every offender and offence should, at the very offset, be dragged into the public assembly. Persons who have the care of a congregation, the seniors whose age and experience have taught them prudence, ought to be first informed of such cases; and they ought to present the matter to the congregation.  Every  novice  is  not  to  feel  himself  at  liberty  to disturb the congregation by presenting, on his own responsibility, and at his own discretion, a complaint against a brother, whether it be of a public or private nature. 

But  we  are  now  speaking  of  the  *manner*  of  procedure  in  such cases. The most tender regard for the feelings of all, the utmost sympathy  for  the  offender,  the  most  unyielding  firmness  in applying  the  correctives  which  the  Head  of  the  church  has commanded, and the necessity of acting promptly in accordance with the law in the case, are matters of much importance. 

No  passion,  no  partiality,  no  bad  feeling — nothing  but  love  and piety,  but  faithfulness  and  truth;  nothing  but  courtesy  and gentleness, should ever appear in the house of God. And when any one is found guilty and excluded from the society, it should be done  with  all  solemnity,  and  with  prayer  that  the  institution  of Christ may be a blessing to the transgressor. 

But evil-doers, or those that act not honorably according to the law of Christ, ought not to be tolerated in the professed family of God. Such  persons  are  a  dead  weight  on  the  whole  society — spots  in every feast of love, and blemishes upon the whole profession. One sinner  destroys  much  good;  yet  separation  or  abscission,  like amputation, is only to be used in the last stage, when all other remedies,  of  remonstrance  and  admonition,  expostulation  and entreaty,  have  failed.  To  prevent  gangrene,  or  an  injury  to  the whole  body,  amputation  is  necessary,  an  indispensable  remedy. More strictness, more firmness, and more tenderness in such cases, would add greatly to the moral influence of every society. A few persons walking together in the bonds of Christian affection, and under the discipline of Christ, is better than the largest assembly in which there are visibly and manifestly, many who fear not God, and keep not his commandments. 

In the house of God, all should be purity, reverence, meekness, brotherly  kindness,  and  love.  Confidence  in  the  honesty  and sincerity  of  our  brethren,  is  the  life  of  communion.  To  feel ourselves united with them who are determined for eternal life, and resolved to seek first of all, chief of all, above all, the kingdom of heaven: and the righteousness required in it, is most animating, comforting, exhilarating. But to be doubtful whether we are uniting with a mass of ignorance, corruption, and apathy, is a rottenness in the bones; love waxes cold, and then we have the form, without the power of godliness. 

That the church may have a regenerating influence upon society at large, there is wanting a fuller display of Christian philanthropy in all  her  public  meetings;  care  for  the  poor,  manifested  in  the liberality  of  her  contributions;  the  expression  of  the  most unfeigned sympathy for the distresses of mankind, not only among the brotherhood, but among all men; and an ardent zeal for the conversion of sinners proportioned to her professed appreciation of the value of her own salvation, and to her resources and means of enlightening the world, on the things unseen and eternal. The full display of these attributes, is the most efficient means of causing the gospel to sound abroad, and to achieve new conquests among our fellow citizens. The Christian health and vigor of every church, is to be estimated more by her exertions and success in bringing sinners home to God, than by all her other attainments. Too long has it been considered the duty, the almost exclusive duty of the preacher, to convert the world. He must spend his time, and wear out  his  constitution  in  journeyings  and  preachings,  while  the individual members of the church are to mind their own business, seek their own wealth and domestic comfort. He must endure the heat and the cold, forsake his wife and family, and commit the management of his affairs to others, while they have only to look on and pray for his success. Strange infatuation! Has he received a commission from the skies — has he been drafted out of the ranks to go to war, and they all left at home to take care of their wives and children! Some may believe this — some may imagine that it is his duty alone to spend his time and his talents in this work, and theirs daily to labor for their own interest and behoof; but surely such are not the views and feelings of our brethren! 

The work of the Lord will never progress — or in other words, the regenerating  influence  of  the  church  will  amount  to  little  or nothing, so long as it is thought to be not equally the duty of every member, or the special duty of one or two, denominated preachers, to labor for the Lord. 

There is either a special call, a general call, or no call at all, to labor for the conversion of the world. If there be a few specially called, the rest have nothing to do but to mind their own concerns; 'to seek their own things, and not the things of Jesus Christ.' If none be called, then it is the duty of none, and the Lord has nothing for his people to do — no world to convert; or, at least, nothing for them  to  do  in  that  work.  None  of  us  are  prepared  for  the consequences of either of these assumptions. It follows, then, that it is the duty of all to labor according to their respective abilities in this work. All are called to labor for the Lord. I hold that every citizen in Christ's kingdom is bound to take up arms for the King, as much as I am; and if he cannot go to the fight the battles of the Lord, he must take care of the wives and children of those who can, and will fight for their King and country. But the expense of the war must be borne by the subjects of the crown; and as the Lord will not have any tax-gatherers in his kingdom, but accepts only voluntary contributions, he makes a mark over against the names of those who do nothing, and he will settle with them at his return. He calls  even the contributions  for the gospel, made by those  at  home,  'a  fragrant  odor,  a  sacrifice  acceptable,  well pleasing to God.'  

But we are afraid of doing anything of this sort, lest we should be like  some  other  people,  who  we  think  have  acted  imprudently. Strange, indeed, that when anything has been once abused, it is never again to be used! But I have inadvertently strayed off from my  purpose.  The  manner  in  which  the  brethren  labor  for  the salvation  of  the  world,  is  all  that  comes  within  our  prescribed limits. On this enough has been said. Let the brethren solemnly consider the things that are wanting to give to their meetings that influence  which they  ought  to  exert upon themselves and upon society at large. 

We are susceptible of receiving moral and religious advantages, from  our own  good order  and decorum  in the  congregation, as those who attend our meetings as spectators. And in this instance, as well as sin all the variety of doing good, he that waters others is again  watered  in  return;  for  he  that  blesses  others,  is  always blessed in blessing them. None enjoy the blessings of the gospel more  fully,  than  they  who  are  most  active  and  influential  in blessing others. What happy seasons are those in which we see many turning to the Lord! Now if we would have a perpetual feast, we must be perpetually devoted to the promotion of the happiness of others. We must live for God, as well as live to God. 

In filling up these outlines, other matters still more minute, but, perhaps, equally important, will present themselves to the attention of the brethren. Now we cannot set about these matters too soon. The time has again come, when judgment must begin at the house of God. The people who have long enjoyed the word of the life and the Christian institutions  must soon  come to  a reckoning. They must  give  an  account  of  their  stewardship,  for  the  Lord  has promised to call them to a judgment. An era is just at the door, which will be known as *the Regeneration* for a thousand years to come. The Lord Jesus will judge that adulterous brood, and give them over to the burning flame, who have broken the covenant, and formed alliances with the governments of the earth. Now the cry is heard in our land, 'Come out of her, my people, that you partake  not  of  her  sins,  and  that  you  may  not  receive  of  her plagues.' The Lord Jesus will soon rebuild Jerusalem, and raise up the tabernacle of David which have so long been in ruins. Let the church prepare herself for the return of her Lord, and see that she make herself ready for his appearance.  

7. The Regeneration of the World 

   All the kingdoms of this world shall soon become the kingdoms of our Lord the King. He will hurl all the present potentates from their thrones. He will grind to powder the despotisms, civil and ecclesiastic; and with the blast of his mouth, give them to the four winds  of  heaven.  The  antichristian  power,  whether  it  be  called Papistical, Mahomedan, Pagan, or Atheistic, will as certainly be destroyed,  as  Jesus  reigns  in  heaven.  No  trace  of  them  shall remain. The best government on earth, call it English or American, has  within  it  the  seeds  of  its  own  destruction — carries  in  its constitution a millstone, which will sink it to the bottom of the sea. They acknowledge not that God has set his Christ upon his throne. They will not kiss the Son. Society under their economy is not blessed. The land mourns through the wickedness of those that sit in high places. Ignorance, poverty, and crime abound, because of the  injustice  and  iniquities  of  those  who  guide  the  destinies  of nations. Men that fear not God, and love not his Son, and that regard not the maxims of his government, yet wear the sword, and sway the sceptre in all lands. 

This is wholly adverse to the peace and happiness of the world. Therefore, he will break them in pieces like a potter's vessel, and set up an order of society in which justice, inflexible justice, shall have  uncontrolled  dominion.  Jesus  will  be  universally acknowledged by all the race of living men, and all nations shall do him homage. This state of society will be the consummation of the Christian religion, in all its moral influences and tendencies upon mankind. 

How far this change is to be effected by moral, and how far by physical means, is not the subject of our present inquiry. But the preparation of a people for the coming of the Lord must be the result of the restoration of the ancient gospel and order of things. And come when it may, the day of the regeneration of the world will  be  a  day  as  wonderful  and  terrible  as  was  the  day  of  the deluge, of Sodom's judgment, or of Jerusalem's catastrophe. Who shall stand when the Lord does this?  

But  all  the  regenerations,  physical  and  moral,  individual, congregational, or national, are but types and shadows, or means of preparation for the —   

***Regeneration of the Heavens and the Earth*** 

The Bible begins with the generations of the heavens and the earth; but the Christian revelation ends with the regenerations, or new creation of the heavens and the earth. This the ancient promise of God,  confirmed  to  us  by  the  Christian  Apostles.  The  present elements are to be changed by fire. The old or antediluvian earth, was purified by water; but the present earth is reserved for fire, with all the works of man that are upon it. It shall be converted into a  lake  of  liquid  fire.  But  the  death  in  Christ  will  have  been regenerated in body, before the old earth is regenerated by fire. The bodies of the saints will be as homogeneous with the new earth  and  heavens  as  their  present  bodies  are  with  the  present heavens  and  earth.  God  recreates,  regenerates,  but  annihilates nothing; and, therefore, the present earth is not to be annihilated. The best description we can give of this regeneration, is in the words of one who had a vision of it on the island of Patmos. He describes it as far as it is connected with the New Jerusalem, which is  to  stand  upon  the  new  earth,  under  the  canopy  of  the  new heaven: —  

'And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the former heaven and the former earth were passed away; and the sea was no more. And I, John, saw the holy city, the New Jerusalem, descending from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold the  tabernacle  of  God  is  with  men,  and  he  shall  pitch  his  tent among them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be among them — their God. And he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more, nor grief, nor crying; nor shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.' 

8. A Word to the Moral Regenerators of Any Age ****

   God, our heavenly Father, works by means, as we all confess. His means are wisely adapted to the ends he has in view. His agents are the best agents for the work he has to accomplish. He employs not physical means nor agents, for moral ends and purposes. Nor does he produce physical effects, by moral means and agents. He has been  pleased  to  employ  not  angels,  but  men  in  the  work  of regenerating the world. Men have written, printed, and published the gospel for nearly two thousand years. They have perpetuated it from  generation  to  generation.  They  have  translated  it  from language to language, and carried it from country to country. They have preached it in word and in deed, and thus it has come down to our days. 

During  the  present  administration  of  the  reign  of  Heaven,  no change is to be expected; no new mission is to be originated, no new order of preachers is to be instituted. The King has gone to a far  country;  and  before  his  departure,  he  called  together  his servants, and committed to them the management of his estate till he  return.  He  has  not  yet  come  to  reckon  them.  They  were commanded first to proclaim the doctrine of his reign; then to write it in a book, and to commit it to faithful men, who should be able to teach it correctly to others. By these faithful men the records have been kept; and through their vigilance and industry they have been  guarded  from  corruption,  interpolation,  and  change.  One generation  handed  them  over  to  the  next;  and  if  ignorant  and unfaithful copyists neglected their duty, others more faithful have corrected them; and now we are able to hear the words which Jesus spoke, and to read the very periods penned by the Apostles. 

Thus, whatever the Prophets and the Apostles have achieved since their  death,  has  been  accomplished  by  human  agents  like ourselves. Where men have not carried this intelligence in speech or writing, not one of our race knows God or his anointed Savior. No angel nor Holy Spirit has been sent to the Pagan nations: and God has exerted no power out of his word to enlighten or reclaim savage  nations.  These  indisputable  facts  and  truths  have  much moral meaning, and ought to give a strong impulse to our efforts to regenerate the world. 

The best means of doing this is the object now before us; and this is  one,  the  importance  of  which  cannot  be  easily  exaggerated. There are three ways of proceeding in this case, which now seem to  occupy  a  considerable  share  of  public  attention.  These  are properly called *theorizing, declaiming,* and *preaching;* on each of which we may offer a remark or two in passing. 

The *theorizers* are those who are always speculating upon correct notions, or the true theory of conversion. They are great masters of method, and with some of them it is a ruinous error to place faith before regeneration, or repentance after faith. Heresy, with these, is the derangement of the method, which these have proposed for God to work by in converting the sinner. And the true faith which is connected with salvation, is an apprehension of this theory and acquiescence in it. These are all theorists, heady, or speculative Christians; and with them the whole *scheme* of redemption is a splendid theory. 

Our maxim is, *Theory for the Doctors, and medicine for the sick.* Doctors fatten on theories, but patients die who depend on theory for cure. A few grains of practice is worth a pound of theory. The mason  and  the  carpenter  *build*  the  house  by  *rule;*  but  he  that inhabits it, *lives* by *eating* and *drinking.* No man ever was cured physically, politically, morally, or religiously, by learning a correct theory of his  physical,  political,  moral,  or religious malady. As soon might we expect to heal an ulcer on the liver by a discourse upon that organ, its functions, its diseases, and their cure, as to restore  a  sinner  by  means  of  the  theory  of  faith,  repentance, regeneration, or effectual calling. But on this enough has already been said, and more than is necessary to convince those who can think, and who dare to reason on such themes. 

The  *declaimers*  are  not  those  only  who  eulogize  virtue  and reprobate vice; but that large and respectable class who address themselves to the passions, to the hopes and fears of men. They are those who are so rhetorical upon the joys of heaven, and the terrors of hell:  who horrify, terrify, and  allure by the strength  of their descriptions,  the  flexions  of  their  voices,  the  violence  of  their gestures,  and  their  touching  anecdotes.  Their  hearers  are  either dissolved in tears, or frantic with terror. These talk much about the heart; and, on their theory, if man's heart was extracted, all his religion would be extracted with it. The religion of their converts flows in their blood, and has its foundation in their passions. 

The *preachers,* properly so called, first address themselves to the understanding,  by  a  declaration  or  narrative  of  the  wonderful works of God. They state, illustrate, and prove the great facts of the  gospel;  they  lay  the  whole  record  before  their  hearers;  and when they have testified what God has done, what he has promised and threatened, they exhort their hearers on these premises, and persuade them to obey the gospel, to surrender themselves to the guidance  and  direction  of  the  Son  of  God.  They  address themselves  to  the  whole  man,  his  understanding,  will,  and affections,  and  approach  the  heart  by  taking  the  citadel  of  the understanding. 

The accomplished and wise proclaimer of the word will find it always expedient to address his audience in their proper character; to approach them through their prejudices, and never to find fault with these prepossessions, which are not directly opposed to the import and design of the ministry of reconciliation. He will set before them the models found in the sacred history, which show that the same discourse is not to be preached in every place and to every assembly, even when it is necessary to proclaim the same gospel. Paul's address to the Athenians, Lycaonians, Antiochians, to Felix, the Jailor, and king Agrippa, are full of instruction on the topic. 

Augustine  has  written  a  treatise  on  preaching,  which  Luther proposed to himself as a model; but it is said that Augustine fell as far short of his own precepts, as did any of his contemporaries. We all can with more facility give precepts to others, than conform to them  ourselves.  In  Augustine's  treatise,  which  in  some  respects influenced and formed the style and plan of Luther, and through him all the Protestants, there is much said on the best rhetorical mode "of exhibiting the truth to others;" but it savors more of the art  of  the  schoolmen,  than  of  the  wisdom  of  the  Apostles.  He labors more on the best style and mode of expressing one's self, than on the things to be said. 

Our best precepts in this matter are derived rather from the books of Deuteronomy and Nehemiah, than from any other source out of the New Testament. The book of Deuteronomy may be regarded as a series of sermons or discourses, delivered to the Jews by their great teacher, Moses, rather than as a part of the Jewish history. Two things in this book deserve great attention. The first is the simplicity,  fulness,  and  particularity  of  his  narratives  of  the incidents on the journey through the wilderness; — God's doings and theirs, for the last forty years, are faithfully and intelligibly laid before  them.  The  next  is  the  use  made  of  these  facts;  the conclusions deduced, the arguments drawn, and the exhortations tendered from these facts. For a fair and beautiful specimen of this, let  the  curious  reader  take  up  and  carefully  read  the  first  four chapters of the book of Deuteronomy. The fact and the application, the  argument  and  the  exhortation  after  the  manner  of  Moses, cannot fail to instruct him. 

The writings of the scribes during the captivity, teach us how to address a people that have lost the true meaning of the oracles of God. The readings, expositions, exhortations, and prayers of Ezra and Nehemiah, are full of instruction to Christians in these days of Babylonish  captivity.  To  address  a  people  long  accustomed  to hearing  the  Scriptures,  yet  ignorant  of  them,  and  consequently disobedient, is a matter that requires all the wisdom and prudence which can be acquired from Jewish and Christian records. 

The manner of address, next to the matter of it, is most important. The  weightiest  arguments,  the  most  solemn  appeals,  the  most pathetic expostulations, if not sustained by the gravity, sincerity, and piety of the speaker, will be like water spilled upon the ground. A little levity, a few witticisms, a sarcastic air, a conceited attitude, or a harsh expression, will often neutralize all the excellencies of the  most  scriptural  and  edifying  discourse.  The  great  work  of regenerating men is too solemn, too awfully grave and divine, to allow anything of the sort. Humility, serenity, devotion, and all benevolence in aspect, as well as in language, are essential to a successful proclamation of the great facts of the Living Oracles. He that can smile in his discourse at the follies, need not weep over the  misfortunes,  of  the  ignorant  and  superstitious.  He  that  can, while preaching the gospel, deride and ridicule the errors of his fellow professors, is, for the time being, disqualified to persuade them  to  accept  of  truth,  or  gladly  to  receive  the  message  of salvation. 

Those  preachers  have  been  sadly  mistaken,  who  have  sought popularity  by  the  eccentricities,  and  courted  smiles  rather  than souls; — who,  by  their  anecdotes  and  foolish  jests,  told  with  the Bible  before  them,  have  thought  to  make  themselves  useful  by making themselves ridiculous — and to regenerate men by teaching them how to violate the precepts of the gospel, and to disdain the examples of the Great Teacher and his Apostles. 

It will not do. These are the weapons of this world, and no part of the armor of light. Jesus and his Apostles never sanctioned, by precept  or  example,  such  a  course;  and  it  is  condemned  by  all sensible men, whether Jews or Gentiles, professors or profane.  

In attempting to regenerate men, we must place before them the new  man,  not  the  old  man,  in  the  preacher  as  well  as  in  the discourse; and while we seek out arguments to convince and allure them, we must show them in our speech and behavior, that we believe what we preach. So did the Apostles and Evangelists. They commended themselves to every man's conscience in the sight of Jesus Christ. 

Error must be attacked. It must be opposed by the truth. But it may be asked, whether the darkness may not be more easily dissipated by the introduction of light, than by elaborate discourses upon its nature and attributes. So with moral darkness, or error. To dissipate it most effectually, the easiest and readiest way is to introduce the light of truth. No preacher is obliged to learn all the errors of all ages, that he may be able to oppose them; nor is the congregation enlightened in the knowledge of God by such expositions of error. Present opposing errors may require attention; but, to attack these most  successfully,  it  is  only  necessary  to  enforce  the  opposing truths. 

This  is  a very  grave subject,  and requires very grave  attention. Much  depends  upon  a  rational  and  scriptural  decision  of  the question, *Which is the most effectual way to oppose and destroy error?* To aid us in such an inquiry, it is necessary to examine how the Prophets and Apostles opposed the errors of their times. The world was as full of error in those days as it has ever been since. The idolatries of the Pagan world, and the various doctrines of the sects of philosophers, in and out of the land of Israel, threw as much labor into their hands, as the various heresies of apostate Christendom have thrown into ours. Their general rule was to turn the artillery of light, and to gather into a focus the arrows of day, upon  the  dark  shades  of  any  particular  error.  Their  philosophy was; — The splendors of light most clearly display the blackness of darkness,  and  scatter  it  from  its  presence.  Thus  they  opposed idolatry, superstition, and error of every name. Going forth in the armor of light, as the sun in the morning, the shades of the night retired  from  their  presence,  and  the  cheering  beams  of  day  so gladdened the eyes of their converts, that they loved darkness no more. Let us go and do likewise. 

An  intimate  acquaintance  with  the  Holy  Scriptures  is  the  best apparatus for the work of regenerating men. The best piece I have found in the celebrated treatise of Augustine on preaching is the following: —   

"He, then, who handles and teaches the word of God, should be a defender  of  the  true  faith,  and  a  vanquisher  of  error;  and  in accomplishing this, the object of preaching, he should conciliate the adverse, excite the remiss, and point out to the ignorant their duty and future prospects. When, however, he finds his audience favorably disposed, attentive, and docile, or succeeds in rendering them so, then other things are to be done, as the case may require. If they are to be instructed, then, to make them acquainted with the subject in question, narration must be employed; and to establish what is doubtful, resort must be had to reasoning and evidence. If they are to be moved rather than instructed, then, to arouse them from  stupor  in  putting  their  knowledge  into  practice,  and  bring them to yield full assent to those things which they confess to be true, there will be need of the higher powers of eloquence; it will be  necessary  to  entreat,  reprove,  excite,  restrain,  and  do whatsoever else may prove effectual in moving the heart. 

"All this, indeed, is what most men constantly do, with respect to those  things  which  they  undertake  to  accomplish  by  speaking. Some,  however,  in  their  way  of  doing  it,  are  blunt,  frigid, inelegant;  others,  ingenious,  ornate,  vehement.  Now  he  who engages in the business of which I am treating, must be able to speak  and  dispute  with  wisdom,  even  if  he  cannot  do  so  with eloquence, in order that he may profit his audience; although he will profit them less in this case, than if he could combine wisdom and  eloquence  together.  He  who  abounds  in  eloquence  without wisdom, is certainly so much the more to be avoided, from the very fact that the hearer is delighted with what it is useless to hear, and  thinks  what  is  said  to  be  true,  because  it  is  spoken  with elegance. Nor did his sentiment escape the notice of those among the ancients, who yet regarded it as important to teach the art of rhetoric; they confessed that wisdom without eloquence profited states but very little, but that eloquence without wisdom profited them not at all, and generally proved highly injurious. If, therefore, those who taught the precepts of eloquence, even though ignorant of the true, that is, the celestial wisdom 'which cometh down from the Father of lights,' were compelled by the instigations of truth to make such a confession, and that too in the very books in which their  principles  were  developed;  are  we  not  under  far  higher obligations to acknowledge the same thing, who are the sons and daughters  of  this  heavenly  wisdom?  Now  a  man  speaks  with greater or less wisdom according to the proficiency he has made in the  sacred  Scriptures.  I  do  not  mean  in  reading  them  and committing them to memory, but in rightly understanding them, and diligently searching into their meaning. There are those who read them and yet neglect them — who read them, to remember the words,  but  neglect  to  understand  them.  To  these,  without  any doubt, those persons are to be preferred, who retaining less the words  of  the  Scriptures,  search  after  their  genuine  signification with the inmost feelings of the heart. But better than both is he, who  can  repeat  them  when  he  pleases,  and  at  the  same  time understands them as they ought to be understood."15

Luther's  favorite  maxim  was,  "*Bonus  Textuarius,  Bonus Theologus;*" or, One well acquainted with the Scriptures makes a good theologian. 

There is one thing, above all others, which must never be lost sight of by him, who devotes himself to the work of regeneration. This all-important consideration is, that the end of the object of all his labors is *to impress the moral image of God upon the moral nature of man.* To draw this image upon the heart, to transform the mind of man into the likeness of God in all moral feeling, is the end proposed in the remedial system. The mould into which the mind of man is to be cast is the Apostles' doctrine; or the seal by which this impression is to be made is the testimony of God. The gospel facts are like so many types, which, when scientifically arranged by  an  accomplished  compositor,  make  a  complete  form,  upon which, when the mind of man is placed by the power which God has given to the preacher, every type makes its full impression upon  the  heart.  There  is  written  upon  the  understanding,  and engraved upon the heart, the will, or law, of character of our Father who is in heaven. 

The Apostles were these accomplished compositors, who gave us a *perfect  'form  of  sound  words.*'  Our  instrumentality  consists  in bringing the minds of men to this form, or impressing it upon their hearts. To do this most effectually, the preacher or evangelist must have the word of Christ dwelling in him richly, in all wisdom; and he  must  'study  to  show  himself  an  approved  workman, irreproachable, rightly dividing the word of truth.' He that is most eloquent and wise in the Holy Scriptures, he who has them most at command,  will  have  the  most  power  with  men;  because  being furnished  with  the  words  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  he  has  the  very arguments,  which  the  Spirit  of  God  chooses  to  employ  in quickening the dead in converting sinners. For to the efficacy of the living word not only Paul deposes, but James and Peter also bear ample testimony. 'Of his own will he has begotten us, *by the word  of  truth,*  that  we  might  be  a  kind  of  first  fruits  of  his creatures.'16 'Having been regenerated, not by corruptible seed, but by  incorruptible,  *through  the  word*  of  the  living  God,  which remains."17 To the fruits of his labors, such a preacher with Paul may say, 'To Jesus Christ, through the gospel, I have regenerated, or begotten you.' 

Thus, in the midst of numerous interruptions, we have attempted to lay  before  the  minds  of  our  readers  the  whole  doctrine  of Regeneration, in all its length and breadth, in the hope, that after a more particular attention to its meaning and value, by the blessing of  God,  they  may  devote  themselves  more  successfully  to  this great work; and not only enjoy more of the Holy Spirit themselves, but be more useful in forwarding the moral regeneration of the world. 

To God our Father, through the great Author of the Christian faith, who has preserved us in health in this day of affliction and great distress, be everlasting thanks for the renewing of our minds by the Holy Spirit, and for the hope of the regeneration of our bodies, of the heavens and of the earth, at the appearance of the Almighty Regenerator, who comes to make all things new! Amen.

12 It may again be necessary in this fastidious age, to remark, that in this essay, in order to disabuse the public mind on our use and acceptation of the term *regeneration,* we have taken the widest range, which a supreme regard for the 

apostolic style could, in our judgment, allow. While we argue that the phrase *bath  of  regeneration,*  (  Titus  3:5.)  is  equivalent  to  *immersion,*  as  already explained, and as contradistinguished from the *renewing of the Holy Spirit,* of which the immersed believer is a proper subject; we have spoken of the whole process of renovation, not in the strict application of the phrase, Titus 3:5, but rather in the whole latitude of the figure employed by the Apostle. It is not the first act of begetting, nor the last act of being born, but the whole process of conversion alluded to in the figure of *generation,* to which we have directed the  attention  of  our  readers.  For,  as  often  before  stated,  our  opponents deceive themselves and their hearers, by representing us as ascribing to the word  *immersion,*  and  the  act  of  immersion,  all  that  they  call  *regeneration.* While, therefore, we contend that being 'born again,' and being immersed, are, in  the  Apostle's  style,  two  names  for  the  same  action,  we  are  far  from supposing,  or  teaching,  that  in  forming  the  new  man,  there  is  nothing necessary but to be born.  

`  `If any ask, why this matter was not fully developed in our first essays on this subject, our answer is, Because we could not anticipate, that our opponents would  have  so  represented  or  misrepresented  our  views.  Were  a  General asked, why he did not arrange all his troops in the beginning of the action, as he had them arranged when he triumphed over his enemy, he would reply, That the manoeuvres and assaults of the enemy, directed the disposition of his forces.  

`  `Our opponents contend for a regeneration, begun and perfected, before faith or baptism — a spiritual change of mind by the Holy Spirit, antecedent to either knowledge, faith, or repentance, of which infants are as susceptible as adults; and,  therefore,  as  we  contend,  make  the  gospel  of  no  effect.  By  way  of reprisals, they would have their converts to think, that we go for nothing but water, and sarcastically  call  us the advocates of  "water  regeneration." They think there is something more sublime and divine in "spirit regeneration;" and therefore claim the title of orthodox. This calumny has been one occasion of the present essay, and it has occasioned that part of it, which gives the fullest latitude to the term *regeneration,* which analogy gives to the figure used by the Apostle.  But  when  we  speak  in  the  exact  style  of  the  living  oracles  on  this subject, we must represent *being born again,* ( John 3:5,) and *regeneration,* ( Titus 3:5,) as relating to the act of immersion alone. See *Extra Defended,* pp. 24-36.  

13 *August* 1*st.* —  I have just now opened the CincinnaTim. *Baptist Journal* of 26 July, from which I read an approved definition of regeneration. It is orthodox, 

spiritual, physical, mystical, and metaphysical Regeneration. It is quoted from the " STANDARD." Regeneration, in the *Evangelical Standard,* is thus defined: —   

- Is the sinner active in regeneration? Certainly he is. His mind is a thinking 

rational principle, which never ceases to act; and, therefore, when the word *passive* is applied to it, by Old Divines, or by Calvinists, they do not mean that it is *literally* dead, like inert matter, which requires a physical impulse to put it in motion. They only mean to convey the scriptural idea, that the Holy Spirit is the *sole* agent in regeneration, and that the sinner has no more *efficient agency* in accomplishing it, than Lazarus had in becoming alive from the dead. Still they grant that his mind is most active, but unhappily its activity is all *against* the Divine influence; as the Scriptures assure us, unregenerated persons 'do always resist' the strivings of the Spirit. ' *Every* imagination of the thoughts of man's heart is *only* evil continually.' ' There is none that doeth good, no, *not one.*' The sinner, therefore, instead of voluntarily co-operating with the Holy Spirit, does all he can to *resist* his divine influence, and *prevent* his own regeneration, until he is *made* willing by almighty power."  

`  `What a comfortable thing is this theory of regeneration! The sinners to be regenerated when actively striving against the Divine influence. At the moment of  regeneration,  "he  has,"  in  one  sense,  "no  more  efficient  agency  in accomplishing it, than Lazarus had in becoming alive from the dead;" and in another  sense,  he  is  not  passive,  but  "does  all  he  can  to  *resist*  the  Divine influence,  and  *prevent*  his  own  regeneration,  until  he  is  *made*  willing  by almighty power." This is *standard* divinity; and he that preaches this divinity, is a  pious,  regenerated,  Regular  Orthodox  Baptist  Christian  Minister!  Of  how much value on this theory, is all the preaching in Christendom? The Holy Spirit may be busily at work upon some drunken sot, or some vile debauchee, who is as dead as Lazarus on one side, and on the other resisting the Spirit, with all his moral and physical energy, up to the moment that the Almighty arm pierces him to the heart with a sword, and makes him alive by killing him!!!  

`  `The  absurdity  and  licentiousness  of  such  a  view  of  the  great  work  of renovation, we had thought so glaring, that no editor in the West would have had boldness to have published it. This is a proof of the necessity of our present essay, and will explain to the intelligent reader why we have given to the whole process of renovation, the name of regeneration, which properly belongs to the last act.

Part VI:  Breaking the Loaf 

Man was not made for the Christian institution; but the Christian Institution  for  man.  None  but  a  master  of  the  human constitution — none  but  one  perfectly  skilled  in  all  the  animal, intellectual, and moral endowments of man, could perfectly adapt an institution to man in reference to all that he is, and to all that he is  destined  to  become.  Such  is  the  Christian  Institution.  Its evidences of a divine origin increase and brighten in the ratio of our progress in the science of man. He who most attentively and profoundly reads himself, and contemplates the picture which the Lord of this Institution has drawn of him, will be most willing to confess,  that  man  is  wholly  incapable  of  originating  it.  He  is ignorant of himself, and of the race from which he sprang, who can persuade himself that man, in any age, or in any country, was so far superior to himself as to have invented such an Institution as the Christian. That development of man, in all his natural, moral, and religious relations, which the Great Teacher has given, is not farther beyond the intellectual powers of man, than is the creation of the Sun, Moon, and Stars beyond his physical strength. 

The eye of man cannot see itself; the ear of man cannot hear itself; nor the understanding of man discern itself: but there is one who sees the human eye, who hears the human ear, and who discerns the human understanding. He it is, who alone is skilled in revealing man to himself, and himself to man. He who made the eye of man, can he not see? He who made the ear of man, can he not hear? He who made the heart of man, can he not know? 

It is as supernatural to adapt a system to man, as it is to create him. He has never thought much upon his own powers, who has not seen as much wisdom on the outside, as in the inside of the human head. To suit the outside to the inside, required as much wisdom as to suit the inside to the outside, and yet the exterior arrangement exists for the interior. To fashion a casement for the human soul exhibits as many attributes of  a creator, as to  fashion a human spirit  for  its  habitation.  Man,  therefore,  could  as  easily  make himself, as a system of religion to suit himself. It will be admitted, that it calls for as much skill to adapt the appendages to the human eye, as the human eye to its appendages. To us it is equally plain, that  it  requires  as  much  wisdom  to  adapt  a  religion  to  man, circumstanced as he is, as to create him an intellectual and moral being. 

But to understand the Christian Religion, we must study it; and to enjoy it, we must practice it. To come into the kingdom of Jesus Christ is one thing, and to live as a wise, a good, and a happy citizen is another. As every human kingdom has its constitution, laws, ordinances, manners, and customs; so has the kingdom of the Great King. He, then, who would be a good and happy citizen of it, must understand and submit to its constitution, laws, ordinances, manners, and customs. 

The object of the present essay is to develop one of the institutions or ordinances of this kingdom; and this we shall attempt by stating, illustrating, and sustaining the following propositions: —  

***Proposition 1 – There is a house on earth, called the house of God.*** 

The most high God dwells not in temples made with human hands; yet he condescended in the age of types to have a temple erected for himself, which he called his house, and glorified it with the symbols  of  his  presence.  In  allusion  to  this,  the  Christian community, organized under the government of his Son, is called his  house  and  temple.  'You  are  God's  building,'  says  Paul  to  a Christian community. This building is said to be 'built upon the Apostles and Prophets — Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.' 'Know you not that you are the temple of God? The temple of God is holy, which temple you are.'1 

But in allusion to the Jewish temple, the Christian church occupies the middle space between the outer court and the holiest of all. 'The holy places made with hands were figures of the true.' The common priests went *always* into the first tabernacle or holy place, and the high priest *once a year* into the *holiest of all.* Thus, our Great High Priest went *once for all* into the true 'holiest of all,' into the real presence of God, and has permitted us Christians as a royal priesthood, as a chosen race, to enter always into the only holy place now on earth — the Christian church. 'As living stones we are built  up  into  a  *spiritual  house,*  a  holy  priesthood,  to  offer  up spiritual sacrifices most acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.'2 

But all we aim at is to show that the community under Christ is called '*the house of God.*' Paul once calls it *a* house of God, and once *the* house of God. An individual or single congregation, he calls '*a house of God.*'3 I have written to you, 'that you may know 

how  to  behave  yourself  in  a  house  of  God,  which  is  the congregation  of  God.'4  And  in  his  letter  to  the  Heb.  5:1-14 

speaking of the whole Christian community, he calls it the house of God.6 'Having a Great High Priest over the house of God, let us 

draw near," etc. It is, then, apparent, that there is under the Lord Messiah, now on earth, an institution called *the house of God;* and this  resembles  the  *holy  place*  between  the  outer  court  and  the holiest of all, which is the position to be proved. 

***Proposition 2 – In the house of God there is always the table of the Lord.*** 

As there is  an analogy  between the Jewish holy  place, and the Christian  house  of  God;  so  there  is  an  analogy  between  the furniture  of  the  first  tabernacle  or  holy  place,  and  those  who officiated in it; and the furniture of the Christian house of God, and those who officiate in it. 'In the first tabernacle, said Paul, which is called  *holy,*  there  were  the  candlestick,  and  the  table,  and  the showbread,'  or  the  loaves  of  the  presence.  On  the  golden  table every  Sabbath  day  were  placed  *twelve*  loaves,  which  were exhibited there for one week, and on the next Sabbath they were substituted  by  twelve  fresh  loaves  sprinkled  over  with frankincense. The loaves which were removed from the table, were eaten by the priests. These were called in the Hebrew, 'the loaves of the faces,' or the loaves of the presence. This emblem of the abundance of spiritual food in the presence of God for all who dwell  in  the  holy  place,  stood  always  upon  the  golden  table furnished by the twelve tribes, even in the wilderness. The light in the first tabernacle was not from *without,* but from the seven lamps placed on the golden candlestick; emblematic of the perfect light not derived from this world, which is enjoyed in the house of God. 

If, then, in the emblematic house of God, to which corresponds the Christian house of God, there was not only a table overlaid with gold, always spread, and on it displayed *twelve large loaves,* or cakes, sacred memorials and emblems of God's bounty and grace; shall we say that in that house, over which Jesus is a Son, there is not to stand always a table more precious than gold, covered with a richer repast for the holy and royal priesthood which the Lord has instituted, who may always enter into the holy place consecrated by himself. 

But we are not dependent on analogies, nor far fetched inferences, for the proof of this position. Paul, who perfectly understood both the Jewish and Christian Institutions, tells us, that there is in the Christian temple a table, appropriately called the Lord's Table, as a part of its furniture. He informs those who were in danger of being polluted by idolatry, 'that they could not be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of demons.'7 In all his allusions to this table in this connection, he represents it as continually approached by those in the Lord's house. 'The cup of the Lord' and 'the loaf,' for which thanks were continually offered, are the  furniture of this table, to which the Christian brotherhood have free access. 

The Apostle Paul reminds the saints in Corinth of their familiarity with the Lord's table, in speaking of it as being common as the meetings of the brotherhood. 'The cup of blessing for which we bless God, is it not the joint participation of the blood of Christ? The loaf which we break, is it not the joint participation of the body  of  Christ?'  In  this  style  we  speak  of  things  common  and usual, never thus of things uncommon or unusual. It is not the cup which we *have* received with thanks; nor is it the loaf which we *have* broken; but which we *do* break. But all that we aim at here is now accomplished; for it has been shown that, *in the Lord's house there is always the table of the Lord.* It is scarcely necessary to add, that if it be shown, that in the Lord's house there is the Lord's table, as a part of the furniture, it must always be there, unless, it can be shown that only some occasions require its presence, and others its absence; or that the Lord is poorer or more churlish at one time than at another; that he is not always able to keep a table, or  too  parsimonious  to  furnish  it  for  his  friends.  But  this  is  in anticipation of our subject, and we proceed to the third proposition. 

***Proposition 3 – On the Lord's table there is of necessity***  

***but one loaf.*** 

The necessity is not that of a positive law enjoining one loaf and only one, as the ritual of Moses enjoined twelve loaves. But it is a necessity arising from the meaning of the Institution as explained by  the  Apostles.  As  there  is  but  one  literal  body,  and  but  one mystical or figurative body having many members; so there must be but one loaf. The Apostle insists upon this, 'Because there is one loaf, we, the many, are one body; for we are all partakers of that one  loaf.'8  The  Greek  word  *artos,*  especially  when  joined  with words of number, says Dr. Macknight, always signifies *a loaf,* and is  so  translated  in  our  Bibles,  'Do  you  not  remember  the  *five loaves?*'9 There are many instances of the same sort. Dr. Campbell says, "that in the plural number it ought always to be rendered loaves;" but when there is a numeral before it, it indispensably must be rendered a loaf or loaves. Thus we say one loaf, seven loaves; not one bread, seven breads. 'Because there is one loaf,' says Paul, we must consider the whole congregation as one body. Here the Apostle reasons from what is more plain, to what is less plain;  from  what  was  established,  to  what  was  not  so  fully established in the minds of the Corinthians. There was no dispute about the one loaf; therefore, there ought to be none about the one body. This mode of reasoning makes it as certain as a positive law: because that which an Apostle reasons from must be an established fact,  or  an  established  principle.  To  have  argued  from  an assumption or a contingency to establish the unity of the body of Christ,  would  have  been  ridiculous  in  a  logician,  and  how unworthy of an Apostle! It was, then, an established institution, that there is but one loaf, inasmuch as the Apostle establishes his argument  by  a  reference  to  an  established  fact.  Our  third proposition is, then, sustained that *on the Lord's table there is of necessity but one loaf.* 

***Proposition 4 – All Christians are members of the house or family of God, are called and constituted a holy and a royal priesthood, and may, therefore bless God for the Lord's table, its loaf, and cup — approach it without fear and partake of it with joy as often as they please, in remembrance of the death of their Lord and Savior.*** 

The  different  clauses  of  this  proposition,  we  shall  sustain  in order — '*all Christian are members of the family or house of God:*'10

'But Christ is trusted as a Son over *his own family;* whose family we  are,  provided  we  maintain  our  profession  and  boasted  hope unshaken to  the end;' — '*are called and constituted a holy and a royal  priesthood.*'11  You,  also,  as  living  stones  are  built  up  a spiritual temple, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices most acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.' In the 9th verse of the same  chapter  he  says,  'But  you  are  an  elect  race,  a  chosen generation,  a  royal  priesthood;'  and  this  is  addressed  to  all  the brethren  dispersed  in  Pontus,  Galatia,  Cappadocia,  Asia,  and Bithynia. 

May not, then, *holy* and *royal* priests thank God for the Lord's table, its loaf, and cup of wine? May they not, without a *human* priest to consecrate the way for them, approach the Lord's table and handle the loaf and cup? If the common priests did not fear to approach a golden table, and to place upon it the loaves of the presence; if they feared not to take and eat the consecrated bread, because  priests  according  to  the  flesh — shall  royal  priests  fear, without the intervention of human hands, to approach the Lord's table and to partake of one loaf? If they should, they know not how to appreciate the consecration of Jesus, nor how to value their high calling and exalted designation as kings and priests to God. And may  we  not  say,  that  he  who  invested  with  a  little  clerical authority, derived only from 'the Man of Sin and Son of Perdition,' if borrowed from  the Romanists,  says  to  them, 'stand by,  I am holier than thou' — may we not say that such a one is worse than Diotrephes, who affected a pre-eminence, because he desecrates the royal priesthood of Jesus Christ, and calls him common and unclean, who has  been consecrated by the blood  of the Son of God? Such impiety can only be found amongst them who worship the beast, and who have covenanted and agreed that none shall buy or  sell,  save  those  who  receive  a  mark  on  their  foreheads,  and letters patent in their hands. But allow common sense to whisper a word into the ears of priests' "laymen," but Christ's '*royal priests.*' Do you not thank God for the cup while the priest stands by the table; and do you not handle the loaf and cup when they come to you? And would not your thanksgiving have been as acceptable, if the human mediator had not been there, and your participating as well pleasing to God, and as consolatory to yourself, if you had been the first that had handled the loaf or the cup, as when you are the second, or the fifty-second, in order of location? Let reason answer these two questions, and see what comes of the haughty assumptions of your Protestant clergy!! But this only by the way. 

I trust it is apparent that the royal priesthood may approach the Lord's  table  *without  fear,*  inasmuch  as  they  are  consecrated  to officiate by a blood, as far superior to that which consecrated the fleshly  priesthood,  as  the  Lord's  table,  covered  with  the  sacred emblems of the sacrifice of the Lord himself, is superior to the table which held only the twelve loaves of the presence; and as they are, to say the least, called by as holy and divine an election, and are as *chosen a race* of priests, as were those sprung from the loins of Levi. 

***Proposition 5 – The one loaf must be broken before the saints feast upon it, which has obtained for this        institution the name of "breaking the loaf."*** 

But some, doubtless, will ask, 'Is it not called *the Lord's Supper?*' Some have thought, amongst whom is Dr. Bell, that 1 Cor. 11:20. applies to the feasts of love or charity, rather than the showing forth the Lord's death. These may read the passage thus: — 'But your coming together into one place is not to eat a Lord's supper; for in eating it every one takes first his own supper; alluding, as they suppose, to a love feast eaten before *the breaking the loaf.*' But this Lord's supper is contradistinguished from their *own* supper. And might it not as reasonably be said, you cannot call *your* showing forth the Lord's death a Lord's supper; for before eating it you have eaten a supper of your own, which prevents you from making a *supper* of it? You do not make it a Lord's supper, if you first eat your supper. Nor, indeed, could the Corinthians call any eating a "Lord's supper," conducted as was the eating of their own suppers; for one ate and drank to excess, while another who was poor, or had no supper to bring, was hungry and put to shame. Could this be called a supper in honor of the Lord! 

But as the Lord had eaten a religious supper, had partaken of the paschal lamb with his disciples, before he instituted the breaking of the loaf, and drinking of the cup, as commemorative of his death, it seems improper to call it a supper; for it was instituted and eaten *after a supper.* Not in the sense of one of the meals of the day, can it be called either dinner or supper; for it supplies the place of no meal.  *Deipnos,*  here  rendered  *supper,*  in  the  days  of  Homer, represented breakfast.12 It also signified food in general or a feast. 

In the times of Demosthenes, it signified a feast or an evening meal. But it is of more importance to observe, that it is in the New Testament used figuratively as well as literally. Hence, we have the gospel blessings compared to a supper. We read of the 'marriage supper of the Lamb,' and 'the supper of the Great God.' Jesus says, 'If any man open to me, I will (*deipneso*) take supper with him and he with me.' When thus used it neither regards the time of day, nor the  quantity  eaten.  If  applied,  then,  to  this  institution  it  is figuratively, as it is elsewhere called "*the feast.*" For not only did the Lord appoint it, but in eating it we have communion with the Lord. The same idiom with the addition of the article occurs in Rev. 1:10. '*he kuriake hemera,*' the Lord's day. Upon the whole it appears more probable that the Apostle uses the words *kuriakos deipnos,* or Lord's supper, as applicable to the breaking of the loaf for which they gave thanks in honor of the Lord, than to their own supper or the feasts of love, usual among the brethren. If we say in accordance  with  the  Apostle's  style,  the  Lord's  day,  the  Lord's table, the Lord's cup, we may also say the Lord's supper. For in the Lord's house these are all sacred to him. 

As the calling of Bible things by Bible names is an important item in  the  present  reformation,  we  may  here  take  the  occasion  to remark,  that  both  "the  Sacrament"  and  "the  Eucharist"  are  of human  origin.  The  former  was  a  name  adopted  by  the  Latin church; because the observance was supposed to be an oath or vow to the Lord; and, as the term *sacramentum* signified an oath taken by a Roman soldier, to be true to his general and his country, the presumed to call this institution a sacrament or oath to the Lord. By the Greek church it is called *the Eucharist,* which word imports *the  giving  of  thanks,*  because  before  participating,  thanks  were presented for the loaf and the cup. It is also called the communion, or "*the communion of the saints;*" but this might indicate that it is exclusively  *the*  communion  of  saints;  and,  therefore,  it  is  more consistent to denominate it literally 'the breaking of the loaf.' But this is the only preliminary to the illustration and proof of our fifth proposition. 

We have said that the loaf must be broken before the saints partake of it. Jesus took a loaf from the paschal table and broke it before he gave it to his disciples. They received a broken loaf, emblematic of his  body  once  whole,  but  by  his  own  consent  broken  for  his disciples. In eating it we then remember that the Lord's body was by his own consent broken or wounded for us. Therefore, he that gives thanks for the loaf should break it, not as the representative of the Lord, but after his example; and after the disciples have partaken of this loaf, handing it to one another, or while they are partaking of it, the disciple who brake it partakes with them of the broken loaf — thus they all have communion with the Lord and with one another in eating the broken loaf. And thus they as priests feast upon his sacrifice. For the priests ate of the sacrifices and were thus partakers of the altar. The proof of all that is found in the institution given in Matt. 26:1-75 : Mark 14:1-72 : Luke 22:1-71 : and 1 Cor. 11:1-34 : In each of which his breaking of the loaf, *after* giving thanks, and *before* his disciples partook of it, is distinctly stated. 

It  is  not,  therefore,  strange,  that  the  literal  designation  of  this institution  should  be,  what  Luke  has  given  it  in  his  Acts  of Apostles thirty years after its institution. The first time he notices it is Acts 2:42. when he calls it emphatically *te klasei tou artou,* the breaking of the loaf, a name at the time of his writing, A. D. 64, universally understood. For, says he, in recording the piety and devotion  of  the  first  converts,  'they  continued  steadfast  in  the teaching of the Apostles, in the fellowship, in *the breaking of the loaf,* in the prayers — praising God.' It is true, there is more than breaking a loaf in this institution. But, in accordance with general, if not universal usage, either that which is first or most prominent in laws, institutions, and usages, gives a name to them. Thus we have our *Habeas Corpus,* our *Fieri Facias,* our *Nisi* *Prius,* our *Capias,* our *Venditioni Exponas,* names given from the first words of the law. 

But  to  break  a  loaf,  or  *to  break  bread,*  was  a  phrase  common amongst the Jews to denote ordinary eating for refreshment. For example, Acts 2:46. 'Daily, with one accord, they continued in the temple and in breaking bread from house to house. They ate their *food* with gladness and simplicity of heart.' Also, after Paul had restored Eutychus at Troas, we are informed he brake a loaf and ate.  Here  it  must  refer  to  himself,  not  only  because  it  is  used *indefinitely,* but because he that eats is the same number with him that breaks a loaf. But when an established usage is referred to, the article or some definite term ascertains what is alluded to. Thus, Acts 2:42. it is '*the* breaking of *the* loaf.' And Acts 20:7. it is 'They assembled for *the* breaking of the loaf.' This loaf is explained by Paul,  1  Cor.  10:16.  '*The*  loaf  which  we  break,  is  it  not  the communion of the body of Christ.' This proposition being now, as we judge, sufficiently evident, we shall proceed to state our sixth. 

***Proposition 6 – The breaking of the loaf and the      drinking of the cup are commemorative of the Lord's death.*** 

Upon the loaf and upon the cup of the Lord, in letters which speak not  to  the  eye,  but  to  the  heart  of  every  disciple,  is  inscribed, "*When this you see, remember me.*" Indeed, the Lord says to each disciple, when he receives the symbols into his hand, 'This is my body broken for *you.* This is my blood shed for *you.*' The loaf is thus  constituted  a  representation  of  his  body — first  whole,  then wounded for our sins. The cup is thus instituted a representation of his blood — once his life, but now poured out to cleanse us from our sins. To every disciple he says, For *you* my body was wounded; for *you* my life was taken. In receiving it the disciple says, "Lord, I believe it. My life sprung from thy suffering;  my joy from thy sorrows; and my hope of glory everlasting from thy humiliation and  abasement  even  to  death."  Each  disciple,  in  handing  the symbols to his fellow-disciple, says, in effect, "You, my brother, once an alien, are now a citizen of heaven; once a stranger, are now brought home to the family of God. You have owned my Lord as your Lord, my people as your people. Under Jesus the Messiah we are one. Mutually embraced in the everlasting arms, I embrace you in mine: thy sorrows shall be my sorrows, and thy joys my joys. Joint debtors to the favor of God and the love of Jesus, we shall jointly suffer with him, that we may jointly reign with him. Let us, then, renew our strength, remember our King, and hold fast our boasted hope unshaken to the end." 

- Blest be the tie that binds  

`  `Our hearts in Christian love;  

`  `The fellowship of kindred minds    Is like to that above."  

` `Here  he  knows  no  man  after  the  flesh.  Ties  that  spring  from eternal love, revealed in blood, and addressed to his senses, draw forth all that is within him of complacent affection and feeling, to those joint heirs with him of the grace of eternal life. While it represents to him '*the bread of life*' — all the salvation of the Lord — it is the strength of his faith, the joy of his hope, and the life of his love.13

This  institution  commemorates  the  love  which  reconciled  us  to God, and always furnishes us with a new argument to live for him who died for us. Him who feels not the eloquence and power of this argument, all other arguments assail in vain. God's goodness, developed in creation and in his providence, is well designed to lead men to reformation. But the heart, on which these fail, and to which  Calvary  appeals  in  vain,  is  past  feeling,  obdurate,  and irreclaimable, beyond the operation of any moral power known to mortal man. 

Every time the disciples assemble around the Lord's table, they are furnished with a new argument also against sin, as well as with a new proof of the love of God. It is as well intended to crucify the world in our hearts, as to quicken us to God, and to diffuse his love within us. Hence it must in reason be a stated part of the Christian worship,  in  all  Christian  assemblies;  which  leads  us  to  state, illustrate, and sustain the following capital proposition, to which the preceding six are all preliminary. 

***Proposition 7 – The breaking of the one loaf, and the    joint participation of the cup of the Lord, in             commemoration of the Lord's death, usually called "the Lord's Supper," is an instituted part of the worship and edification of all Christian congregations in all their    stated meetings.*** 

***Argument*  1**.  The  first  Christian  congregation  which  met  in Jerusalem, and which was constituted by the twelve Apostles, did as  statedly  attend  upon  the  breaking  of  the  loaf  in  their  public meetings, as they did upon any other part of the Christian worship. So  Luke  records,  Acts  2:42.  'They  continued  steadfast  in  the Apostles' doctrine, in the fellowship, in *the breaking of the loaf,* and in the prayers.' Ought we not, then, to continue as steadfast in the breaking of the loaf, as in the teaching of the Apostles, as in the fellowship, as in the prayers commanded by the Apostles? 

***Argument* 2**. The Apostles taught the churches to do all the Lord commanded. Whatever, then, the churches did by the appointment or concurrence of the Apostles, they did by the commandment of Jesus  Christ.  Whatever  acts  of  religious  worship  the  Apostles taught and sanctioned in one Christian congregation, they taught and sanctioned in all Christian congregations, because all under the same government of one and the same King. But the church in Troas met upon the first  day of the week, consequently all the churches met upon the first day of the week for religious purposes. 

Among  the  acts  of  worship,  or  the  institutions  of  the  Lord,  to which the disciples attended in these meetings, the breaking of the loaf was so conspicuous and so important, that the churches are said to meet on the first day of the week for this purpose. We are expressly told that the disciples at Troas met for this purpose; and what one church did by the authority of the Lord, as a part of his instituted worship, they all did. That the disciples in Troas met for this purpose is not to be inferred; for Luke says positively, Acts 20:7.) 'And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together for the breaking of the loaf, Paul, being about to depart on the  morrow,  discoursed  with  them,  and  lengthened  out  his discourse till midnight.' From the manner in which this meeting of the disciples at Troas is mentioned by the historian, two things are very obvious — 1st. That it was an established custom or rule for the disciples to meet on the first day of the week. 2d. That the primary object of their meeting was to break the loaf. They who object to breaking the loaf on the first day of every week when the disciples are assembled, usually preface their objections by telling us, that Luke does not say they broke the loaf *every* first day; and yet they contend against the Sabbatarians, that they ought to observe *every* first day to the Lord in commemoration of his resurrection. The Sabbatarians  raise  the  same  objection  to  this  passage,  when adduced by all professors of Christianity to authorize the weekly observance of the first day. They say that Luke does not tell us, that they met for any religious purpose on *every* first day. How inconsistent,  then,  are  they  who  make  this  sentence  an  express precedent for observing *every* first day, when arguing against the Sabbatarians, and then turn round and tell us, that it will not prove that they broke the loaf *every* first day! If it does not prove the one, it  is  most  obvious  it  will  not  prove  the  other;  for  the  weekly observance of this day, as a day of the meeting of the disciples, and the weekly breaking of the loaf in those meetings, stand or fall together. Hear it again: 'And on the first day of the week, when the disciples assembled to break the loaf.' Now all must confess, who regard the meaning of words, that the meeting of the disciples and the breaking of the loaf, as far as these words are concerned, are expressed in the same terms as respects the frequency. If the one was *fifty-two* times in a year, or only *once;* so was the other. If they met every first day, they broke the loaf every first day; and if they did not break the loaf every first day, they did not meet every first day. But we argue from the style of Luke, or from his manner of 

The definite article is,  in  the Greek and in  the English tongue, prefixed to stated fixed times, and its appearance here is not merely definitive of one day, but expressive of a stated or fixed day. This is so in all languages which have a definite article. Let us illustrate this by a very parallel and plain case. Suppose some 500 or 1000 years hence the annual observance of the 4th of July should have ceased  for  several  centuries,  and  that  some  person  or  persons devoted to the primitive institutions of this mighty Republic, were desirous of seeing the 4th of every July observed as did the fathers and founders of the Republic during the hale  and undegenerate days of primitive republican simplicity. Suppose that none of the records of the first century of this Republic had expressly stated, that it was a regular and fixed custom for a certain class of citizens to pay a particular regard to the 4th day of every July; but that a few incidental expressions in the biography of the leading men in the Republic spoke of it as Luke has done of the meeting at Troas. How would it be managed? For instance, in the life of John Quincy Adams it is written, A. D. 1823, "And on the 4th of July, when the republicans of the city of Washington met to dine, John Q. Adams delivered an oration to them." Would not an American, a thousand years hence, in circumstances such as have been stated, find in these words *one* evidence that it was an established usage, during the  first  century  of  this  Republic,  to  regard  the  4th  of  July  as aforesaid. He would tell his opponents to mark, that it was not said that on *a* fourth of July, as if it were a particular occurrence; but it was, in the fixed meaning of the English language expressive of a fixed and stated day of peculiar observance. At all events, he could not fail in convincing the most stupid, that the primary intention of that meeting was *to dine.* Whatever might be the frequency or the intention  of  that  dinner,  it  must  be  confessed,  from  the  words 

above cited, that they *met to dine.* 

Another  circumstance  that  must  somewhat  confound  the Sabbatarians, and the lawless observers of the breaking of the loaf, may  be  easily  gathered  from  Luke's  narrative.  Paul  and  his company arrived at Troas either on the evening of the first day, or on Monday morning at an early hour; for he departed on Monday morning, as we term it, at an early hour; and we are positively told that he tarried just seven days at Troas. Now, had the disciples been Sabbatarians, or observed the seventh day as a Sabbath, and broke the loaf on it as the Sabbatarians do, they would not have deferred  their  meeting  till  the  first  day,  and  kept  Paul  and  his company waiting, as he was evidently in a great haste at this time. But his tarrying *seven* days, and his early departure on Monday morning, corroborates the evidence adduced in proof, that the first day of the week was the *fixed* and *stated* day, for the disciples to meet for this purpose.14

From the 2d of the Acts, then, we learn that *the breaking of the loaf,*  was  a  stated  part  of  the  worship  of  the  disciples  in  their meetings; and from the 20th we learn, that the first day of the week was the stated time for those meetings; and above all, we ought to notice that the most prominent object of their meeting was to break the loaf. Other corroborating evidences of the stated meeting of the disciples on the first day for religious purposes, are found in the fact, that Paul says he had given order to all the congregations in Galatia, as well as that in Corinth, to attend to the fellowship, or the laying up of contributions for the poor saints on the first day of every week. 'On the first day of *every week* let each of you lay somewhat by itself, according as he may have prospered, putting it into the treasury, that when I come there may be no collections'15

for the saints. *Kata mian Sabbaton* Macknight justly renders, '*the first day of  every week;*' for  every linguist will admit  that  *kata polin* means every city; *kata menan,* every month; *kata ecclesian,* every  church;  and,  therefore,  in  the  same  usage,  *kata  mian Sabbaton* means the first day of every week. 

Now this prepares the way for asserting not only, that the disciples in Troas assembled on the first day of every week for 'the breaking of the loaf,' but also for adducing a third argument: —  

***Argument* 3**. The congregation in Corinth met every first day, or the first day of every week, for showing forth the Lord's death. Let the reader bear in mind that he has just heard that Paul commanded the  church  in  Corinth,  or  every  saint  in  Corinth,  to  contribute according to his ability, by putting into the treasury every first day his  contributions  to  avoid  collections  when  Paul  came.  This  is agreed on all hands  to  prove the weekly meeting of the saints. Now, with this concession in mind, we have only to notice what is said, chap. 11: 20. 'When you come together in one place, that is, every week at least, *this is not to eat the Lord's supper.*' To act thus is unworthy of the object of your meeting. To act thus is not to eat the Lord's supper. It is not to show forth the Lord's death. Thereby declaring that this is the chief object of meeting. When a teacher reproves his pupils for wasting time, he cannot remind them more forcibly of the object of coming to school, nor reprove them with more point, than to say, 'When you act thus, this is not to assemble to learn.' This is the exact import of the Apostle's address, 'When you assemble thus, it is *not* to eat the Lord's supper.' We have seen, then, that the saints met every first day in Corinth; and when they assembled  in  one  place  it  was  to  eat  the  Lord's  supper,  a declaration  of  the  practice  of  the  primitive  congregations  as explicit as could incidentally be given, differing only from a direct command in the form in which it is expressed. But it is agreed on all  hands,  that  whatsoever  the  congregations  did  with  the approbation of the Apostles, they did by their authority. For the Apostles  gave  them  all  the  Christian  institutions.  Now  as  the Apostle  Paul  approbated  their  meeting  every  week,  and  their coming  together  into  one  place  to  show  forth  the  Lord's death; — and only censured their departure from the meaning of the institution,  it  is  as  high  authority  as  we  could  require  for  the practice of the weekly meeting of the disciples. 

But when Acts 2:42; Acts 20:7. 1 Cor. 11:20 and chap. 16: 1 & 2, are compared and added together, it appears that we act under the influence of apostolic teaching and precedent, when we meet every Lord's day  for the breaking of the loaf. But this is  still farther demonstrated  by  a  fourth  argument  drawn  from  the  following fact: —  

***Argument* 4**. *No example can be adduced from the New Testament of any Christian congregation assembling on the first day of the week,  unless  for  the  breaking  of  the  loaf.*  Let  an  example  be adduced by those who teach that Christians ought to meet on the first day of the week not to break the loaf, and then, but not till then, can they impugn the above fact. Till this is done, a denial of it  must  appear  futile  in  the  extreme.  The  argument,  then,  is, Christians have no authority, nor are under any obligations to meet on  the  Lord's  day,  from  anything  which  the  Apostles  said  or practiced, unless it be to show forth the Lord's death, and to attend to those means of edification and comfort connected with it. 

***Argument* 5**. If it be not the duty and privilege of every Christian congregation to assemble on the first day of every week to show forth the Lord's death, it will be difficult, if not impossible, from either scripture or reason, to show that it is their duty or privilege to meet monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually, or indeed, at all, for this purpose. For from what premises can any person show that it is a duty or privilege to assemble monthly, which will not prove  that  it  is  obligatory  to  meet  weekly?  We  challenge investigation here, and affirm that no man can produce a single reason,  why  it  should  or  could  be  a  duty  or  a  privilege  for  a congregation to meet monthly, quarterly, or annually, which will not prove that it is its duty and privilege to assemble every first day for this purpose. 

***Argument*  6**.  Spiritual  health,  as  well  as  corporeal  health,  is dependent on food. It is requisite for corporeal health, that the food not only be salutary in its nature, and sufficient in its quantity, but that it be received at proper intervals, and these regular and fixed. Is it otherwise with moral health? Is there no analogy between the bread which perishes, and the bread of life Is there no analogy between natural and moral life — between natural and moral health? and, if there be, does it not follow, that if the primitive disciples only enjoyed good moral health, when they assembled weekly to show forth the Lord's death, that they cannot enjoy good moral health who only meet quarterly or semi-annually for this purpose? ***Argument* 7**. But in the last place, what *commemorative* institution, in any age, under any religious economy, was ordained by divine authority, which had not a fixed time for its observance? Was it the commemoration of the finishing of creation signified in the weekly Sabbath?  Was  it  the  Passover,  the  Pentecost,  the  Feast  of Tabernacles?  Was  it  the  Feast  of  Purim  either?  What  other significant usage was it, the times or occasion of whose observance were not fixed. How often was circumcision to be administered to the same subject? How often Christian immersion? Is there a single institution commemorative of anything, the meaning, or frequency, of the observance of which, is not distinctly, either by precept or example, laid down in the Holy Scriptures? Not one of a *social* character,  and  scarcely  one  of  an  individual  character.  The commemoration  of  the  Lord's  death  must,  then,  be  a  weekly institution — an institution in all the meetings of the disciples for Christian  worship;  or  it  must  be  an  anomaly — a  thing  *sui generis* — an institution like no other of divine origin. And can any one tell  why Christians  should celebrate the  Lord's resurrection *fifty-two* times in a year, and his death only *once, twice,* or *twelve* times?  He  that  can  do  this  will  not  be  lacking  in  a  lively imagination, however defection he may be in judgment, or in an acquaintance with the New Testament. 

***Objections Considered*** 

Having  written  so  much  on  this  subject  formerly,  I  shall  now introduce a few persons out of the many men of renown who, since the Reformation, have pled this cause. We shall not only introduce them to our readers, but we shall let them speak to them. —  

*John Brown,* of Haddington, author of the Dictionary of the Bible, and teacher of theology for that branch of the Presbyterian church called the "*Secession,*" has written a treatise on this subject. We shall give him the task of stating and removing the objections to this apostolic institution. The reader will perceive that there are many impurities in his style; and although his speech betrays that he  has  been  in  Ashdod,  still  his  arguments  are  weighty  and powerful. 

He  offers  various  arguments  for  the  weekly  observance  of  this institution, and states and refutes nine objections to the practice. A few of the strongest we shall quote: —  

"All  the  arguments  I  ever  knew  advanced  in  support  of  the unfrequent  administration  of  the  Lord's  supper,  appear  to  me altogether destitute of force. The following are the principal: —  

***Objection* 1**. The frequent administration of this ordinance, in the apostolic and primitive ages of Christianity, was commendable and necessary, because the continual persecutions that then raged, gave them ground to fear that every Sabbath might be their last; whereas now we are not in such danger, and therefore need not so frequent use of this ordinance. 

***Answer**.* 

` `Ought we not still to live as if every Sabbath were to be our last? Have we now a lease on our life more than these had? Did not many Christians in these times live to as great an age as we do now? Indeed, is it not evident, from the best  historians,  that  the  church  was  generally  under  no persecution  above  one-third  of  the  time,  that  weekly communion  was  practiced?  But,  say  they  had  been constantly  exposed  to  the  cruelest  persecution,  the objection becomes still more absurd. If they attended this ordinance weekly at the peril of their lives does it follow that now, when God gives us greater and better opportunity for it, we ought to omit it? Does God require the greatest work  at  his  people's  hands,  when  he  gives  least opportunity? Or does he require least work, when he gives the greatest opportunity for i? What kind of a master must God be, if this were the case? Besides, do not men need this ordinance  to  preserve  them  from  the  influence  of  the world's smiles as much as of its frowns? — "Let us invert this objection, and try if it has more force. It would then run thus: The primitive Christians received the Lord's supper weekly,  as  their  souls  were  in  greater  danger  from  the smiles  and  allurements  of  the  world,  which  are  usually found  more  hurtful  to  men's  spiritual  concerns  than  its frowns; and as they had greater opportunity for doing so by their  enjoying  peace  and  liberty;  yet  this  frequency  of administering and partaking is  not  requisite  now, as we, being under the world's frowns, are in less hazard as to our spiritual concerns; and especially, as we cannot attend upon it  but  at  the  peril  of  our  lives,  God  having  expressly declared that he loves mercy better than sacrifice. 

***Objection* 2**. The primitive and reforming times were seasons of great spiritual liveliness, and of large communications of divine influences to the souls of believers; whereas it is quite otherwise now.  Therefore,  though  frequent  administration  was  then commendable;  yet,  in  our  languishing  decayed  state,  it  is unnecessary. 

***Answer**.* 

` `Ought  we  to  repair  seldom  to  the  wells  of  salvation, because we can bring but little water at once from them? Ought we seldom to endeavor to to fill out pitchers at the fountain of living waters, because they are small? Is not this  ordinance  a  cordial  for  restoring  the  languishing, strengthening the weak, recovering the sick, and reviving the dying believer? How reasonable, then, is it to argue that languishing, weak, sick, and dying believers, must not have it often administered to them, just because they are not in perfect  health?" — "Would  not  the  objection  inverted  read better?  The  primitive  Christians  had  this  ordinance frequently  administered  to  them, because, being decayed and withered, weak and sickly, and receiving only scanty communications  of  divine  influence  at  once,  it  was necessary for them to be often taking new meals: whereas, we being now strong and lively Christians, and receiving on  these  occasion  such  large  supplies  of  grace,  as  are sufficient  to  enable  us  to  walk  many  days  under  this powerful  influence,  have  no  occasion  for  so  frequently attending on that ordinance, which is especially calculated for strengthening languishing, weak, sickly believers. 

***Objection* 3**. If the Lord's supper were frequently administered, it would become less solemn, and, in time, quite contemptible, as we see  is  the  case  with  baptism,  through  the  frequency  of  the administration of that ordinance. 

***Answer**.*  

Is this means of keeping up the credit of the Lord's supper, of God's devising or not? If it is, where is that part of his word that warrants it? The contrary I have already proved from Scripture. Since, then, it is only of man's invention, what  ground  is  there  to  hope  it  will  really  maintain  the credit and solemnity of the ordinance? Did not the Papists of old, pretend to maintain and advance its solemnity, by reduction of the frequency of administration? Did they not take away the cup from the people, which Calvin says was the native consequence of the former? Did they not annex the administration of this ordinance to those seasons which superstition  had  aggrandized;  namely,  Easter,  Pentecost, and Christmas? Did they not annex a world of ceremonies to it? Did they not pretend that it was a real sacrifice, and that the elements were changed by consecration, into the real body and blood of Christ? And, did all this tend to the support  of  the  proper  credit  of  this  ordinance?  On  the contrary,  did  it  not  destroy  it?  Though  the  doctrine  of transubstantiation procured a kind of reverence for it, yet, was this reverence divine? or, was it not rather devilish, in worshipping the elements? Now, how are we sure that our unfrequent  administration  of  this  ordinance  will  more effectually support its solemnity? Is it not strange that we should have so much encouragement from the practice of the Apostles, the primitive Christians, and the whole of the reformed churches, to profane this solemn ordinance; while the most ignorant and abandoned Papists are our original pattern, for the course that tends to support its proper honor and credit? What a strange case this must be, if, in order to support the credit of God's ordinance, we must forsake the footsteps  of  the  flock,  and  walk  in  the  paths  originally chalked out by the most ignorant and wicked antichristians? "Besides, if our unfrequent administration of this ordinance render it solemn, would it not become much more so, if administered only once in seven, ten, twenty, thirty, sixty, or a hundred years?" — "Shall we not then find, that those who pray once a month or hear a sermon once-a-year, have their  minds  far  more  religiously  impressed  with  solemn views of God, than those who pray seven times a day, and hear a hundred sermons within the year? 

"Let  us  invert  this  objection,  and see how it stands. All human devices to render God's ordinances more solemn, are impeachments of his wisdom, and have always tended to  bring  the  ordinances  into  contempt.  But  unfrequent administration  of  the  supper  is  a  human  device,  first invented  by  the  worst  Papists,  and  therefore  it  tends  to bring contempt on this ordinance, as we see sadly verified in  the  practice  of  those  who  voluntarily  communicate seldom." 

The means by which the weekly observance of the supper was set aside, Mr. Brown states in the following words: —  

"The means by which the unfrequent administration of this ordinance appears to me to have been introduced into the church, do not savor of the God of truth. The causes that occasioned  its  introduction  appear  to  have  been  pride, superstition,  covetousness,  and  carnal  complaisance.  The eastern hermits, retiring from the society of men, had taken up their residence in deserts and mountains, and, being far removed  from  the  places  of  its  administration,  seldom attended. This, though really the effect of their sloth and distance,  they  pretend  to  arise  from  their  regard  and reverence for this most solemn ordinance. It being easy to imitate  them  in  this  imaginary  holiness,  which  lay  in neglecting  the  ordinance  of  God,  many  of  the  eastern Christians left off to communicate, except at such times as superstition  had  rendered  solemn,  as  at  pasch;  and contented  themselves  with  being  spectators  on  other occasions. On account of this practice, we find the great and  eloquent  Chrysostom,  once  and  again,  bitterly exclaiming against them as guilty of the highest contempt of God and Christ; and calls their practice a most wicked custom." 

An  objection  not  formally  stated  by  Mr.  Brown,  which  I  have frequently heard, is drawn from the words, '*as often as you do this,* do it in remembrance of me.' From these words, it is pled that we are without law in regard to the time how often; and consequently cannot be condemned for a partial or total neglect: for 'where there is no law, there is no transgression.' 'As *often*' is used not to license the  frequency,  but  to  denote  the  manner.  'Always  do  it  in remembrance of me.' The connection in which these words occur regarding the manner or design of the observance, and not how often it may, or may not be celebrated, it is a violation of every rule of interpretation to infer another matter from them, which was not in the eye of the Apostle. Besides, if the words 'as oft' leave it discretionary  with  any  society  how  often,  they  are  blameless  if they never once, or more than once in all their lives, show forth the Savior's death.  This  interpretation makes an observance without reason, without law, without precedent, and consequently without obligation. 

Next to Mr. Brown, we shall introduce a few extracts from *William King,*  Archbishop  of  Dublin.  The  Editors  of  the  *Christian Examiner* presented a very valuable extract from Mr. King, in their 7th of May number of the first volume, from which I quote the following, pp. 163, 165, 166, 167: —  

"The following remarks on this institution of our Savior, are copies from a '*Discourse concerning the* *Inventions of Men in the Worship of God,*' by William King, of Ireland. He was born at Antrim, 1650; educated at Trinity College, Dublin; and held successively the dignities of Dean of St. Patrick's, Bishop of Derry, and Archbishop of Dublin. He died in 1729. His method, in this discourse is to examine and  compare  the  worship  of  God,  as  taught  in  the Scriptures, with the practice of the different religious sects of the day: —  

'Christ's positive command to do this in remembrance of him, etc. must oblige us in some times and in some places; and there can be no better way of determining when we are obliged  to  do  it  than  by  observing  when  God  in  his goodness  gives  us  opportunity;  for  either  we  are  then obliged to do it, or else we may choose whether we will ever do it or no; there being no better means of determining the frequency, than this of God's giving us the opportunity. And  the  same  rule  holding  in  all  other  general  positive commands, such as those that oblige us to charity, we may be sure it holds likewise in this. Therefore, whoever slights or neglects any opportunity of receiving which God afford him, does sin, as certainly as he, who, being enabled by God to perform an act of charity, and invited by a fit object, neglects  to  relieve  him,  or  shuts  up  his  bowels  of compassion against him, concerning *whom* the Scriptures assure us that the love of God dwells not in him. And the arrangement  is  rather  stronger  against  him  who  neglects this holy ordinance; for how can it be supposed *that man* has  a  true  love  for  his  Savior,  or  a  due  sense  of  his sufferings,  who  refuses  or  neglects  to  remember  the greatest  of  all  benefits,  in  the  easiest  manner,  though commanded to do it by his Redeemer, and invited by a fair opportunity of God's own offering. 

"It is manifest that if it be not our own fault, we may have an opportunity every Lord's day when we meet together; and  therefore  that  church  is  guilty  of  laying  aside  the command, whose order and worship doth not require and provide for this practice. Christ's command seems to lead us  directly  to  it:  for,  'Do  this  in  remembrance  of  me,' implies that Christ was to leave them, that they were to meet together after he was gone, and that he required them *to remember him at their meetings whilst he was absent.* The very design of our public meetings on the Lord's day, and not on the Jewish Sabbath, is, to remember and keep in our minds a sense of what Christ did and suffered for us till he come again; and this we are obliged to do, not in such a manner as our own inventions suggest, but by such means as  Christ  himself  has  prescribed  to  us,  that  is,  by celebrating this holy ordinance. 

'It seems then probable, from the very institution of this ordinance, that our Savior designed it should be a part of God's service in all the solemn assemblies of Christians, as the passover was in the assemblies of the Jews. To know, therefore,  how  often  Christ  requires  us  to  celebrate  this feast,  we have no more to  do, but  to  inquire how often Christ requires us to meet together; that is, at least every Lord's day.'" 

Next we shall introduce an American Rabbi of very great celebrity, Dr. John Mason, of New York. The passages which I quote are found in a note attached to page 188th of the New York Edition of Fuller's Strictures on Sandemanianism. 

"Mr.  Fuller  does  not  deny  that  the  Lord's  Supper  was observed by the first Christians every Lord's day, (nor will this be denied by any man who has candidly investigated the subject,) but he seems to think that Acts 20:7. does not prove that it was so; others, eminent for piety and depth of research,  have  considered  this  passage  as  affording  a complete  proof  of  the  weekly  observance  of  the  Lord's supper. Dr. Scott, in his valuable Commentary, observes on this  passage,  '*Breaking  of  bread,*  or  commemorating  the death of Christ in the eucharist, was one chief end of their assembling; this ordinance seems to have been *constantly administered every Lord's day,* and probably no professed Christians absented themselves from it, after they had been admitted  into  the  church;  unless  they  lay  under  some censure, or had some real hindrance.' 

"Dr.  Mason,  of  this  city,  in  his  Letters  on  Frequent Communion,  speaks  on  this  subject  with  still  greater decision. 'It is notorious, that during the first three centuries of  the  Christian  era,  communions  were  held  with  the frequency of which, among us, we have neither example nor  resemblance.  It  is  also  notorious,  that  the  original frequency  of  communions  declined  as  carnality  and corruption gained ground. And it is no less notorious, that it has been urged as a weighty duty by the best of men, and the best churches, in the best of times.' 

"Weekly  communion  did  not  die  with  the  Apostles  and their  contemporaries.  There  is  a  cloud  of  witnesses  to testify  that  they  were  kept  up  by  succeeding  Christians, with great care and tenderness, for above two centuries. It is not necessary to swell these pages with quotations. The fact is indisputable. 

"Communion  every  Lord's  day,  was  universal,  and  was preserved in the Greek church till the seventh century; and such  as  neglected  *three  weeks*  together  were excommunicated. 

"In this manner did the spirit of ancient piety cherish the memory of the Savior's love. There was no need of reproof, remonstrance, or entreaty. No trifling excuses for neglect were ever heard from the lips of a Christian; for  *such* a neglect  had  not  yet  degraded  the  Christian's  name.  He carried in his own bosom sufficient inducements to obey, without  reluctance,  the  precepts  of  his  Lord.  It  was  his choice, his consolation, his joy. These were days of life and glory;  but  days  of  dishonor  and  death  were  shortly  to succeed; nor was there a more ominous symptom of their approach, than the decline of frequent communicating. For as the power of religion appears in a solicitude to magnify the  Lord  Jesus  continually,  so  the  decay  of  it  is  first detected by the encroachments of indifference. It was in the *fourth* century, that the church began very discernibly to forsake her first love. 

"The  excellent  Calvin  complains  that  in  this  day, professors, conceiting that they had fully discharged their duty by a single communion, resigned themselves for the rest of the year, to supineness and sloth. 'It ought to have been,' says he, 'far otherwise. *Every week,* at least, the table of  the  Lord  should  have  been  spread  for  Christian 

assemblies; and the promises declared, by which, partaking of it, we might be spiritually fed.'"16

We  shall  now  hear  the  celebrated  John  Wesley.  After  *fifty  five* years' reflection upon the subject, he decides that Christians should show forth the Lord's death every Lord's day. He prefaces 106th Sermon, Luke 22:19, with this remark: —  

"This discourse was written above fifty and five years ago, for the use of my pupils at Oxford. I have added very little, but retrenched much; as I then used more words than I now do. But I thank God, I have not yet seen cause to alter my sentiments in any point which is therein delivered." 

The  Sermon  is  titled  "The  Duty  of  Constant  Communion," concerning which the Reformer says —  

"It is no wonder that men who have no fear of God, should never think of doing this. But it is strange that it should be neglected by any that do fear God, and desire to save their souls; and yet nothing is more common. One reason why many neglect it it, they are so much afraid of *eating and drinking  unworthily,*  that  they  never  think  how  much greater the danger is, when they do not eat or drink at all." 

In speaking of *constantly* receiving the supper, Mr. Wesley says —  

"I say *constantly* receiving. For as to the phrase *frequent* communion,  it  is  absurd  to  the  last  degree.  If  it  means anything  else  but  constant,  it  means  more  than  can  be proved to be the duty of any man. For if we are not obliged to  communicate  *constantly,*  by  what  argument  can  it  be proved  that  we  are  obliged  to  communicate  *frequently?* yea, more than once a year? or once in seven years? or once before  we  die?  Every  argument  brought  for  this,  either proves that we ought to do it *constantly,* or proves nothing at  all.  Therefore  that  undeterminate  unmeaning  way  of speaking,  ought  to  be  laid  aside  by  all  by  all  men  of understanding.  Our  power  is  the  only  rule  of  our  duty. Whatever we can do, that we ought. With respect either to this, or any other command, he that, when he may obey if he will, does not, will have no place in the kingdom of heaven." 

Though we may have some objections to the style in which John Wesley  speaks  of  the  meaning  of  this  institution,  as  we  have indeed to that of all the others from whom we have quoted, yet we would recommend to the whole Methodistic community the close perusal  of  the  above  Sermon.  It  will  be  found  in  vol.  3,  pp. 171-179. 

The Elders among the Methodists, with whom John Wesley is such high authority, we would remind of his *advice,* found in his Letters to America, 1784, lately quoted in the Gospel Herald, Lexington, Kentucky.  

"**I also advise the elders to administer the supper of the lord on every lord's day**." 

So much for John Brown, John Mason, and John Wesley, and the authorities which they quoted. While quoting the sayings of the Johns, I am reminded of something said by the great John Milton, the "immortal bard" of England. In his posthumous works, he says; "The Lord's supper (which the doctrine of transubstantiation, or rather anthropophagy, has well nigh converted into a banquet of cannibals,) is essential to be observed, and may be administered by any one with propriety, as well as by an appointed minister. There is no order of men which can claim to itself either the right of distribution,  or  the  power  of  withholding  the  sacred  elements, seeing that in the church we are all alike priests." "The master of a family, or any one appointed by him, is at liberty to celebrate the Lord's supper from house to house, as was done in the dispensation of the passover" — "all Christians are a royal priesthood: therefore any believer is competent to act as an ordinary minister according as convenience may require, provided only he be endowed with the necessary gifts, these gifts constituting his commission." Thus did the famous John Milton make way for the weekly observance of the supper, by divesting it of the priestly appendages and penances of the dark ages. 

A cloud of witnesses to the plainness and evidence of the New Testament on the subject of the weekly celebration of the Lord's Supper, might be adduced. But this we think unnecessary; and as we would avoid prolixity and tediousness, we shall only add a few extracts from the third volume of the *Christian Baptist,* 2d edt. p. 254, in proof of the assertion — *all antiquity is on the side of the disciples meeting every first day to break the loaf.* —  

All antiquity concurs in evincing that, for the *three first centuries,* all the churches broke bread once a week. Pliny, in his Epistles, Book 10: Justin Martyr, in his Second Apology for the Christians, and Tertullian, De Ora. page 135, testify that it was the universal practice in all the weekly assemblies of the brethren, after they had prayed and sung praises— 

'Then bread and wine being brought to the *chief brother,* he taketh it and offereth praise and thanksgiving to the Father, in the name of the Son and Holy Spirit. After prayer and thanksgiving,  the  whole  assembly  saith,  *Amen!*  When thanksgiving is ended by the *chief guide,* and the consent of the whole people, the *deacons* (as we call them) give to every one present part of the bread and wine, over which thanks are given.' 

"The weekly communion was prepared in the Greek church till the *seventh century;* and, by one of their canons, 'such as  neglected  *three  weeks  together,*  were excommunicated.'17

"In the *fourth century,* when all things began to be changed by baptized Pagans, the practice began to decline. Some of the councils in the western part of the Roman Empire, by their  canons,  strove  to  keep  it  up.  The  council  held  at Illiberis  in  Spain,  A. D.  324,  decreed  that  'no  offerings should be received from such as did not receive the Lord's Supper.'18

"The council at Antioch, A. D. 341, decreed that 'all who came  to  church,  and  heard  the  Scriptures  read,  but afterwards  joined  not  in  prayer,  and  receiving  the 

sacrament, should be cast out of the church, till such time as they gave public proof of their repentance.'19

"All these canons were unable to keep the carnal crowd of professors  in  a  practice  for  which  they  had  no  spiritual taste; and, indeed, it was likely to get out of use altogether. To  prevent  this,  the  Council  of  Agatha,  in  Languedoc, A. D.  506,  decreed  that  'none  should  be  esteemed  good Christians who did not *communicate* at least *three times* a year — at  Christmas,  Easter,  and  Whitsunday.'20  This  soon became the standard of a good Christian, and it was judged presumptuous to commune oftener. 

"Things went on in this way for more than 600 years, until they got tired of even *three* communications in one year; and  the  infamous  Council  of  Lateran,  which  decreed auricular confession and transubstantiation, decreed that 'an annual  communion  at  Easter  was  sufficient.'  This association  of  the  'sacrament'  with  Easter,  and  the mechanical devotion of the ignorant at this season, greatly 

contributed to the worship of the Host.21 Thus the breaking of  bread  in  simplicity  and  godly  sincerity  once-a-week, degenerated  into  a  pompous  sacrament  once-a-year  at Easter. 

"At  the  Reformation  this  subject  was  but  slightly investigated by the reformers. Some of them, however, paid some attention to it. Even Calvin, in his Institutes, lib. 4. chap.  17:  sect.  46,  says,  'And  truly  this  custom,  which enjoins  communicating  once-a-year,  *is  a  most  evident contrivance of the Devil,* by whose instrumentality soever it may have been determined.' 

"And again  (Inst.  lib. 6, chap. 18:  sect.  56,) he says,  'It ought to have been far otherwise. *Every week,* at least, the table of the  Lord should have been spread for Christian assemblies,  and  the  promises  declared  by  which,  in partaking of it, we might be spiritually fed.' 

"Martin Chemnitz, Witsius, Calderwood, and others of the reformers and controversialists, concur with Calvin; and, indeed, almost every commentator on the New Testament concurs with the Presbyterian Henry in the remarks on Acts 20:7. 'In the primitive times  it was the  custom of many churches to receive the Lord's supper every Lord's day.' 

"The  Belgic  reformed  church,  in  1851,  appointed  the supper  to  be  received  every  other  month.  The  reformed churches  of  France,  after  saying  that  they  had  been  too remiss in observing the supper but four times a year, advise a *greater  frequency.*  The church of Scotland began with *four* sacraments in a year; but some of her ministers got up to *twelve* times. Thus things stood till the close of the last century. 

"Since  the  commencement  of  the  present  century,  many congregations in England, Scotland, Ireland, and some in the  United  States  and  Canada,  both  Independents  and Baptists, have attended upon the supper every Lord's day, and the practice is every day gaining ground. 

"These historical notices may be of some use to those who are ever and anon crying out *Innovation! Innovation!* But we  advocate  the  principle  and  the  practice  on  apostolic grounds alone. Blessed is the servant, who, knowing his Master's will, doeth it with expedition and delight! 

"Those who would wish to see an able refutation of the Presbyterian  mode  of  observing  the  sacrament,  and  a defence of weekly communion, would do well to read Dr. John  Mason's  Letters  on  Frequent  Communion,  who  is himself  a  high  toned  Presbyterian,  and  consequently  his remarks will be more regarded by his brethren than mine." 

Thus  our  seventh  proposition  is  sustained  by  the  explicit declarations of the New Testament, by the reasonableness of the thing itself when suggested by the Apostles, by analogy, by the conclusions of the most eminent reformers, and by the concurrent voice of all Christian antiquity. But on the plain sayings of the Lord and his Apostles, we rely for authority and instruction upon *this* and *every other* Christian institution. 

It  does,  indeed,  appear  somewhat  incongruous,  that  arguments should have to be submitted to urge Christians to convene weekly around the Lord's table. Much more in accordance with the genius of  our  religion  would  it  be,  to  see  them  over  solicitous  to  be honored with a seat at the King's table, and asking with intense interest, might they be permitted so often to eat in his presence, and  in  honor  of  his  love.  To  have  to  withstand  their  daily convocations for this purpose, would not be a task so unnatural and so unreasonable, as to have to reason and expostulate with them, to urge them to assemble for weekly communion. 

But as the want of appetite for our animal sustenance is a symptom of  ill  health,  or  approaching  disease;  so  a  want  of  relish  for spiritual food is indicative of a want to spiritual health, or of the presence of a moral disease, which, if not healed, must issue in apostasy from the Living Head. Hence among the most equivocal prognosis  of  a  spiritual  decline,  the  most  decisive  is  a  want  to appetite for the nourishment, which the Good Physician prepared and prescribed for his family. A healthy and vigorous Christian, excluded from the use and enjoyment of all the provisions of the Lord's house cannot be found. 

But much depends upon the *manner* of celebrating the supper, as well  as  upon  the  *frequency.*  The  simplicity  of  the  Christian institution runs through every part of it. While there is the form of doing every thing, there is all attention to the thing signified. But there is the form as well as the substance, and every thing that is done, must be done in some manner. The well bred Christian is like  the  well  bred  gentleman — his  manners  are  graceful,  easy, artless,  and  simple.  All  stiffness  and  forced  formality  are  as graceless in the Christian as in the gentleman. A courteous and polite family differs exceedingly from a soldier's mess mates or a ship's crew, in all the ceremonies of the table. There is a Christian decency and a Christian order, as well as political courtesy and complaisance. 

Nothing  is  more  disgusting  than  mimicry.  It  is  hypocrisy  in manners, which, like hypocrisy in religion, is more odious than apathy  or  vulgarity.  There  is  a  saintishness  in  demeanor  and appearance, which differs as much from sanctity, as foppery from politeness. The appearance of sanctimoniousness is as much to be avoided as actual licentiousness of morals. An austere and rigid pharisaism sits as awkwardly upon a Christian, as a mourning habit upon  a  bride.  Cheerfulness  is  not  mirth — solemnity  is  not pharisaism — joy is not noise — nor eating, festivity. 

But to act right in anything we must feel right. If we would show love, we must first possess it. If a person would walk humbly, he must  be  humble:  and  if  one  would  act  the  Christian  on  any occasion,  he must always live the Christian. Persons who daily converse  with  God,  and  who  constantly  meditate  upon  his salvation,  will  not  need  to  be  told  how  they  should  demean themselves at the Lord's table. 

The following extract from my Memorandum Book furnishes the nighest approach to the model, which we have in our eye, of good order and Christian decency in celebrating this institution. Indeed, the whole order of that congregation was comely: —  

"The church in  —  —  —  —  consisted of about fifty members. Not having any person whom they regarded as filling Paul's outlines  of  a  Bishop,  they  had  appointed  two  senior members, of a very grave deportment, to preside in their meetings. These persons were not competent to labor in the word and teaching; but they were qualified to rule well, and to preside with Christian dignity. One of them presided at each meeting. After they had assembled in the morning, which was at eleven o'clock, (for they had agreed to meet at eleven  and  to  adjourn  at  two  o'clock  during  the  Winter season,) and after they had saluted one another in a very familiar  and  cordial  manner,  as  brethren  are  wont  to  do who  meet  for  social  purposes;  the  president  for  the  day arose and said: 'Brethren, being assembled in the name and by the authority of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, on this day  of  his  resurrection,  let  us  unite  in  celebrating  his praise.' He then repeated the following stanza: —  

- Christ the Lord is risen to-day!  

`  `Sons of men and angels say;  

`  `Raise your joys and triumphs high,    Sing, O heavens! and, earth, reply!"  

` `"The congregation arose and sang this psalm in animating strains.  He  then  called  upon  a  brother,  who  was  a  very distinct  and  emphatic  reader,  to  read  a  section  of  the evangelical history. He arose and read, in a very audible voice, the history of the crucifixion of the Messiah. After a pause  of  a  few  moments,  the  president  called  upon  a brother to pray in the name of the congregation. His prayer abounded with thanksgivings to the Father of Mercies, and with supplications for such blessings on themselves and for all men as were promised to those who ask, or for which men  were  commanded  to  pray.  The  language  was  very appropriate; no unmeaning repetitions, no labor of words, no effort to say anything and every thing that came into his mind; but to express slowly, distinctly, and emphatically, the  desires  of  the  heart.  The  prayer  was  comparatively short;  and  the  whole  congregation,  brethren  and  sisters, pronounced aloud the final *Amen.* 

"After prayer a passage in one of the Epistles was read by the president himself, and a song was called for. A brother arose, and after naming the page, repeated —  

"' Twas on that night when doom'd to know   That eager rage of every foe;  

`  `That night in which he was betray'd  

`  `The Savior of the world took bread."  

` `"He then sat down, and the congregation sang with much feeling. 

"I observed that the table was furnished before the disciples met in the morning, and that the disciples occupied a few benches on each side of it, while the strangers sat off on seats more remote. The president arose and said that our Lord had a table for his  friends, and that he invited his disciples to sup with him. 'In memory of his death, this monumental table,' said he, 'was instituted; and as the Lord ever lives in heaven, so he ever lives in the hearts of his people.  As  the  first  disciples,  taught  by  the  Apostles  in person,  came  together  into  one  place  to  eat  the  Lord's supper, and as they selected the first day of the week in honor of his resurrection, for this purpose; so we, having the same Lord, the same faith, the same hope with them, have vowed to do as they did. We owe as much to the Lord as they; and ought to love, honor, and obey him as they.' Thus having spoken, he took a small loaf from the table, and  in  one  or  two  periods  gave  thanks  for  it.  After thanksgiving,  he  raised  it  in  his  hand,  and  significantly brake it, and handed it to the disciples on each side of him, who passed the broken loaf from one to another, until they all partook of it. There was no stiffness, no formality, no pageantry; all was easy, familiar, solemn, cheerful. He then took the cup in a similar manner, and returned thanks for it, and  handed  it  to  the  disciples  sitting  next  to  him,  who passed it round; each one waiting upon his brother, until all were served. The thanksgiving before the breaking of the loaf,  and  the  disturbing  of  the  cup,  were  as  brief  and pertinent to the occasion, as the thanks usually presented at a common table for the ordinary blessing of God's bounty. They then arose, and with one consent sang —  

- To him that lov'd the sons of men,   And washed us in his blood;  

  `  `To royal honors rais'd our heads,    And made us priests to God!"  

` `"The  president  of  the  meeting  called  upon  a  brother  to remember the poor, and those ignorant of the way of life, before  the  Lord.  He  kneeled  down  and  the  brethren  all united with him in supplicating the Father of Mercies in behalf of all the sons and daughters of affliction; the poor and the destitute, and in behalf of the conversion of the world. After this prayer the fellowship, or contribution, was attended to; and the whole church proved the sincerity of their desires, by the cheerfulness and liberality which they seemed to evince, in putting into the treasury as the Lord had prospered them. 

"A general invitation was tendered to all the brotherhood if they  had  anything  to  propose  or  inquire,  tending  to  the edification  of  the  body.  Several  brethren  arose  in succession, and read several passages in the Old and New Testaments,  relative  to  some  matters  which  had  been subjects  of  former  investigation  and  inquiry.  Sundry remarks  were  made;  and  after  singing  several  spiritual songs selected by the brethren, the president, on motion of a brother who signified that the hour of adjournment had arrived,  concluded  the  meeting  by  pronouncing  the apostolic benediction. 

"I understand that all these items were attended to in all their  meetings;  yet  the  order  of  attendance  was  not invariably the same. On all the occasions on which I was present  with  them,  no  person  arose  of  speak  without invitation, or without asking permission of the president, and no person finally left the meeting before the hour of adjournment, without special leave. Nothing appeared to be done  in  a  formal  or  ceremonious  manner.  Every  thing exhibited the power of godliness as well as the form; and no  person  could  attend  to  all  that  passed  without  being edified and convinced that the Spirit of God was there. The joy, the affection, and the reverence which appeared in this little assembly, was the strongest argument in favor of their order,  and  the  best  comment  on  the  excellency  of  the Christian institution."

Concluding Addresses 

***ADDRESS TO THE CITIZENS OF THE KINGDOM.** Fellow Citizens,* 

Your rank and standing under the reign of the Prince of Peace have never  been  surpassed — indeed,  have  never  been  equaled  by  any portion of the human race. You have visions and revelations of God — his being and perfections — developments of the depths of his wisdom  and  knowledge,  of  the  counsels  of  his  grace,  and  the purposes of his  love, which  give  you an intellectual  and moral superiority  above  all  your  predecessors  in  the  Patriarchal  and Jewish ages of the world. Secrets of God, which were hid from ages and generations, have been revealed to you by the Apostles of the  Great  Apostle  and  High  Priest  of  your  confession. — What Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, David, Isaiah, Daniel, and all the Prophets, down to John the Harbinger, rejoiced to anticipate, you have realized and enjoyed. The intellectual pleasures of the highest  and  most  sublime  conceptions  of  God  and  of  Christ vouchsafed to you, so far transcend the attainments of the ancient people of God, that you are comparatively exalted to heaven, and may enjoy the days of heaven upon earth. You have a book which contains not only the charter of your privileges, but which explains a thousand mysteries in the antecedent administrations of God over all the nations of the earth. In it you have such interpretations of God's past providences in the affairs of individuals, families, and nations,  as  open  to  you  a  thousand  sources  of  rational  and sentimental enjoyment from incidents and things which puzzled and perplexed the most intelligent and highly favored of past ages. Mountains are, indeed, leveled; valleys are exalted; rough places are made plain, and crooked ways straight to your apprehension; and, from these data, you are able to form more just conceptions of the present, and more lofty anticipations of the future, than fell to the  lot  of  the  most  highly  favored  subjects  of  preceding dispensations. And, indeed, so inexhaustible are the deep and rich mines  of  knowledge  and  understanding  in  the  Christian revelations, that the most comprehensive mind in the kingdom of heaven  might  labor  in  them  during  the  age  of  a  Methuselah, constantly  enriching  itself  with  all  knowledge  and  spiritual understanding,  and  yet  leave  at  last  vast  regions  and  tracts  of thought wholly unexplored. 

But this decided superiority over the most gifted saints of former ages you unquestionably enjoy. Among all the living excellencies with which they were acquainted, they wanted a perfect model of all human excellence. Bright as were the virtues and excellencies of an Abraham, a Joseph, a David, there were dark spots, or, at least, some blemishes in their moral character. They failed to place in living form before their contemporaries, or to leave as a legacy to posterity, every virtue, grace, and excellence that adorn human nature. But you have Jesus, not only as 'the image of the invisible God,' 'an effulgence of his glory, and an exact representation of his character;' but as a man, holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sin,  exhibiting  in  the  fullest  perfection  every  excellence  which gives amiability, dignity, and glory to human character. You have motives  to  purity  and  holiness,  a  stimulus  to  all  that  is  manly, good, and excellent, from what he said and did, and suffered as the Son of Man, which would have added new charms and beauties to the most exemplary of all the saints of the olden times. 

Means  and  opportunities  of  the  highest  intellectual  and  moral enjoyments are richly bestowed on you, for which they sighed in vain: God having provided some better things for Christians than for  Jews  and  Patriarchs.  Shall  we  not,  then,  fellow  citizens, appreciate  and  use,  as  we  ought,  to  our  present  purity  and happiness, to our eternal honor and glory, the light which the Sun of  Righteousness  has  shed  so  richly  and  abundantly  on  us? Remember  that  we  stand  upon  Apostles  and  Prophets,  and  are sustained by Jesus, the light of the world, and the interpreter and vindicator of all God's ways to man in creation, providence, and redemption. All suns are stars; and he that is now to us in this life '*the Sun of Righteousness,*' in respect of the future is '*the Bright and Morning Star.*' Till the day of eternity dawn, and the day-star of immortality arise in our hearts, let us always look to Jesus. 

But it is not only the felicity of superior heavenly light, though that is most delectable to our rational nature, which distinguishes you the citizens of this kingdom; but that personal, real, and plenary remission of all sin,  which  you enjoy through the blood  of the Lamb  of  God,  bestowed  on  you  through  the  ordinances  of Christian immersion and confession of sins. 

The Jews, indeed, had sacrifices under the law, which could, and did take away ceremonial sins; and which so far absolved from the guilt  of  transgressing  that  law,  as  to  give  them  a  right  to  the continued enjoyment of the temporal and political promises of the national compact; but farther Jewish sacrifices and ablutions could not reach. — This benefit every Jew had from them. But as respected the conscience, Paul, that great commentator on Jewish sacrifice, assures us they had no power. 'With respect to the conscience,' says he, 'they could not make him who did the service perfect.' 

The entrance of the law gave the knowledge of sin. It gave names to particular sins, and 'caused the offence to abound.' The sacrifices appended to it had respect to that institution alone, and not to sin in general, nor to sin in its true and proper nature. The promise made to the patriarchs, and the sacrificial institution added to it, through faith  in  that  promise,  led  the  believing  to  anticipate  a  real sin-offering; but it appears the Jewish sacrifices had only respect to the Jewish institution, and, excepting their typical character, gave no new light to those under that economy on the subject of a true and *proper* remission of sins, through the real and bloody sacrifice of Christ. 

The Patriarch and the believing Jew, as respected a real remission of sins, stood upon the same ground; for, as has been observed, the legal  institution,  or,  as  Paul  says,  'the  supervening  of  the  law,' made no change in the apprehensions of remission, as respected the conscience. But a new age having come (for 'these ordinances for  cleaning  the  flesh  were  imposed  only  till  the  time  of reformation',)  and  Christ  having,  by  a  more  perfect  sacrifice, opened the way into the true holy places, has laid the foundation for perfecting the conscience by a real and full remission of sins, which, by the virtue of his blood, terminates not upon the flesh, but upon the conscience of the sinner. 

John, indeed, who lived at the dawn of the Reformation, preached reformation with an immersion for the remission of sins; saying that 'they should believe in him that was to come after him.' Those who believed John's gospel, and reformed, and were immersed into John's reformation, had remission of sins through faith in that was to come; but you, fellow-citizens, even in respect of the enjoyment of remission, are  greatly  advanced  above the  disciples  of John. You have been immersed, not only by the authority of Jesus, *as Lord of all,* into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy  Spirit,  but  *into  the  death*  or  sacrifice  of  Christ.  This  no disciple of Moses or of John knew anything about. This gives you an  insight  into  sin,  and  a  freedom  from  it,  *as  respects conscience* — a  peace  and  a  joy  unutterable  and  full  of  glory,  to which  both  the  disciples  of  Moses  and  of  the  Harbinger  were strangers. So that the light of the risen day of heaven's eternal Sun greatly  excels,  not  only  the  glimmerings  of  the  stars  in  the patriarchal age, and the faint light of the moon in the Jewish age, but even the twilight of the morning. 

Your new relation to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, into which you have been introduced by faith in the Messiah and immersion  into  his  death,  verifies,  in  respect  of  the  sense  and assurance of remission, all that John and Jesus said concerning the superiority of privilege, vouchsafed to the citizens of the kingdom of heaven. You can see your sins washed away in the blood that was shed on Mount Calvary. That which neither the highly favored John, nor any disciple of the Messiah could understand, till Jesus said '*it is finished,*' you not only clearly perceive, but have cordially embraced. You can feel, and say with all assurance, that 'the blood of Jesus Christ now cleanses you from all sin;' and that by faith you have access to the Mediator of the New Institution, and to the blood of sprinkling which speaks glad tidings to the heart. You have an Advocate with the Father; and, when conscious of any impurity,  coming  to  him  by  God,  confession  your  sins,  and supplicating pardon through his blood, you have the promise of remission. You now know how God is *just* as well as merciful, in forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin. 

But  superior  light  and  knowledge,  and  enlarged  conceptions  of God,  with  such  an  assurance  of  real  and  personal  remission  as pacifies the conscience and introduces the peace of God into the heart, are not the only distinguishing favors which you enjoy in the new relation of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into which you are introduced under the reign of Heaven; but you are formally *adopted*  *into  the  family  of  God,*  and  constituted  the  sons  and daughters of the Father Almighty. 

To be called '*the friend of God,*' was the highest title bestowed on Abraham; to be called the friends of Christ, was the peculiar honor of the disciples of Christ, to whom he confided the secrets of his reign; but to be called 'the children of God through faith in Jesus Christ,' is not only the common honor of all Christians, but the highest honor which could be vouchsafed to the inhabitants of this earth. Such honor have you, my fellow-citizens, in being related to the only-begotten Son of God: 'For as many as received him he gave the privilege of becoming the sons of God.' These, indeed, were not descended from families of noble blood, nor genealogies of high renown; neither are they the offspring of the instincts of the flesh,  nor  made  the  sons  of  God  'by  the  will  of  man,'  who sometimes adopts the child of another as his own; but they are 'born of God' through the ordinances of his grace. 'Behold how great love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the  children  of  God!'  'The  world,  indeed,  does  not  know  us, because it did not know him. Beloved, now are we the children of God. It does not yet appear what we shall be.' 

'Because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.' And if sons, it follows you 'are heirs  of  God  through  Christ' — the  heir  of  all  things.  Is  this, fellow-citizens, a romantic vision, or sober and solemn truth, that you  are  children  of  God,  possessing  the  spirit  of  Christ,  and constituted heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ of the eternal inheritance! What manner of persons, then, ought you to be! How pure,  how  holy  and  heavenly  in  your  temper;  how  just  and righteous in all your ways; how humble and devoted to the Lord; how joyful and triumphant in your King! 

Permit me, then, to ask, Wherein do you excel? — nay, rather, you will propose this question to yourselves. You will say, How shall we still more successfully promote the interest, the honor, and the triumphs of the gospel of the kingdoms? Is there anything we can do by our behavior, our morality, our piety, by our influence, by all the  earthly  means  with  which  God  has  furnished  us?  Is  there anything we can do more to strengthen the army of the faith, to invigorate the champions of the kingdom, to make new conquests for  our  King?  Can  we  not  increase  the  joy  of  the  Lord  in converting souls — can we not furnish occasions of rejoicing to the angels of God — can we not gladden the hearts of thousands who have never tasted the joys of the children of God? 

In the present administration of the kingdom of God, during the absence of the King, he has said to the citizens, 'Put on the armor of  light' — 'Contend  earnestly  for  the  faith' — 'convert  the world' — 'occupy till I come' — 'let your light shine before men, that they,  seeing  your  good  works,  may  glorify  your  Father  in heaven' — 'that the Gentiles may, by your good works, which they shall behold,  glorify  God in  the day  of visitation.'  He has thus entrusted  to  the  citizens  the  great  work  for  which  he  died — the salvation of men. Let us, then, brethren, be found faithful to the Lord and to men, that he may address us at his coming with the most acceptable plaudit, 'Well done, good and faithful servants; enter into the joy of your Lord!' 

Great as the opposition is to truth and salvation, we have no reason to despond. Greater are our friends and allies, and infinitely more powerful than all our enemies. God is on our side — Jesus Christ is our  King — the  Holy  Spirit  is  at  his  disposal — angels  are  his ministering  servants — the  prayers  of  all  the  prophets,  apostles, saints, and martyrs are for our success — our brethren are numerous and strong — they have the Sword of the Spirit, the shield of faith, the  helmet  of  salvation,  the  breastplate  of  righteousness,  the artillery  of  truth,  the  arguments  of  God,  the  preparation  of  the gospel  of  peace — our  Commander  and  Captain  is  the  most successful General that ever entered the field of war — he never lost a battle — he is wonderful in counsel, excellent in working, valiant in  fight — the  Lord  of  *hosts*  is  his  name.  He  can  stultify  the machinations of our enemies, control all the powers of nature, and subdue all our foes, terrestrial and infernal. Under his conduct we are like Mount Zion, that can never be moved. Indeed, under him we are come to Mount Zion, the strong hold and fortress of the kingdom, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to myriads of angels, the general assembly and congregation of the first born, enrolled in heaven — to God the Judge of all — to the spirits of  just  men  made  perfect — to  Jesus  the  Mediator  of  the  New Constitution — and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks such peace,  and  joy,  and  courage  to  the  heart.  Ought  we  not,  then, brethren, 'to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might?' If in faith, and courage, and prayer, we put on the heavenly armor, and march under the King, sounding the gospel trumpet, the walls of Jericho will fall to the ground, and the banners of the Cross will wave  over  the  ruins  of  Paganism,  Atheism,  Scepticism,  and sectarianism — *Nil desperandum, te duce, Christe.* If a Roman could say, 'Nothing is to be feared under the auspices of Cesar,' may not the Christian say, There is no despair under the guardianship of Messiah the King? 

But,  fellow-citizens,  though  clothed  with  the  whole  panoply  of heaven, and headed by the Captain of Salvation, there is no success in this war to be expected, without constant and incessant prayer. When  the  Apostles  began  to  build  up  this  kingdom, notwithstanding all the gifts they enjoyed, they found it necessary to devote themselves to prayer as well as to the ministry of the word. And when Paul describes all the armor of God, piece by piece, in putting it on he says, 'Take the Sword of the Spirit — with all supplication and deprecation, pray at all seasons in spirit, watch with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints.' 

This  was  most  impressively  and  beautifully  pictured  out  in  the wars of ancient Israel against their enemies. While Moses lifted up his holy hands to heaven, Israel prevailed; and when he did not, Amalek prevailed. So is it now. When the disciples of Christ, the heaven born citizens of the kingdom, continue instant in prayer and watchfulness, the truth triumphs in their hearts and in the world. When  they  do  not,  they  become  cold,  timid,  and  impotent  as Sampson shorn, and the enemy gains strength over them. Then the good cause of the Lord languishes. 

It is not necessary that we should understand how prayer increases our zeal, our wisdom, our strength, our joy, or how it gives success to the cause, any more than that we should understand how our food  is  converted  into  flesh,  and  blood,  and  bones.  It  is  only necessary that we eat; and it is only necessary that we should pray as  we  are  taught  and  commanded.  Experience  proves  that  the outward  man  is  renewed  day  by  day  by  our  daily  bread,  and experience  proves  that  the  inward  man  is  renewed  day  by  day prayer and thanksgiving. The Lord has promised his Holy Spirit to them that ask him in truth; and is it not necessary to our success? If it be not necessary to give new revelations, it is necessary to keep in  mind  those  already  given,  and  to  bring  the  word  written seasonably to our remembrance. Besides, if the Spirit of the Lord was necessary to the success of Gideon and Barak, and Sampson and David, and all the great warriors of Israel according to the flesh, who fought the battles of the Lord with the sword, the sling, and the bow; who can say that it is not necessary to those who draw the Sword of the Spirit and fight the good fight of faith? In my judgment it is as necessary now as then — necessary, I mean, to equal success — necessary to the success of those who labor in the word  and  teaching,  and  necessary  to  those  who  would  acquit themselves like men, in every department in the ranks of the great army of the Lord of hosts. 

Though the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but spiritual, they are mighty (only, however, *through God,* to the overturning of strong holds,) to the overturning of all reasonings against the truth, and every high thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and in leading captive every thought to the obedience of Christ. Let us then,  fellow-citizens,  whether  as  leaders  or  as  private  soldiers, abound  in  prayer  and  supplications  to  God  night  and  day.  If sincere, and ardent, and incessant prayers to God for every thing that he has promised; for all things for which the Apostles prayed were offered us by all the congregations, and by every disciple in his family and in his closet, for the triumphs of the truth, then would  we  see  the  army  of  the  Lord  successful  in  fight  against atheism, infidelity, and sectarianism — then would we see disciples growing in knowledge and in favor with God and man. And is not the conversion of the world and our own eternal salvation infinitely worthy of all the effort and enterprise in man, seeing God himself has done so much in the gift of his Son and Holy Spirit, and left for us so little to do — nothing, indeed, but what is in the compass of our power? And shall we withhold that little, especially as he has given us so many and so exceedingly great and precious promises to  stimulate us to  exertion? Has  not Jesus  said, 'The conqueror shall inherit all things' — that he 'will not blot out his name out of the book of life' — that he will confess it before his Father and his holy angels — that he will place him 'upon his throne, and give him the crown of life that shall never fade away'? 

Rise up, then, in the strength of Judah's Lion! Be valiant for the truth! Adorn yourselves with all the graces of the Spirit of God! Put  on  the  armor  of  light:  and,  with  all  the  gentleness,  and meekness, and mildness there is in Christ — with all the courage, and patience, and zeal, and effort, worthy of a cause so salutary, so pure, so holy, and so divine, determine never to faint nor to falter till you enter the pearly gates — never to lay down your arms, till, with  the  triumphant  millions,  you  stand  before  the  throne,  and exultingly sing, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and glory, and blessing!" — "To him who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb be  blessing,  and  honor,  and  glory  and  strength  forever  and forever!" Amen. 

***A WORD TO FRIENDLY ALIENS.*** 

Whether to regard you in the light of *Proselytes of the Gate,* who refused circumcision, but wished to live in the land of Israel, to be in  the suburbs of the cities  of Judah, and to  keep some of the institutions  of  the  ancient  kingdom  of  God,  without  becoming fellow-citizens of that kingdom; or whether to regard you as the Samaritans of old, who built for themselves a temple of God upon Mount Gerizim, held fast a part of the ancient revelation of God, and  rejected  only  such  parts  of  it  as  did  not  suit  their prejudices — worshipped the God of Israel in common with the idols of the nations, from which they sprang — I say, whether to regard you in the light of the one or the other of those ancient professors of  religion,  might  require  more  skill  in  casuistry  than  we possess — more leisure than we have at our disposal — and more labor than either of us have patience to endure. One thing, however, is obvious, that if, under the Reign of Heaven it behooved so good a man as Cornelius ('a man of piety, and one that feared God with all his house, giving also much alms to the people, and praying to God continually,') to '*hear words by which he might be saved,*' and to put on Christ by immersion into his death, that he might enter the kingdom of heaven, and enjoy the remission of sins, and the hope of  an  inheritance  among  all  the  sanctified — certainly  it  is  both expedient and necessary that you also go and do likewise. 

Every sectarian in the land, how honest and pious soever, ought to bury  his  sectarianism,  and  all  his  other  sins  of  omission  and commission, in 'the bath of regeneration.' It is a high crime and misdemeanor in any man, professing to have received the Messiah in his proper person, character, and office, to refuse allegiance to him in anything; and to substitute human inventions and traditions in lieu of the ordinances and statutes of Prince Immanuel. Indeed, the keeping up of any dogma, practice, or custom, which directly or indirectly supplants  the constitution, laws, and usages of the kingdom  over  which  Jesus  presides,  is  directly  opposed  to  his government; and would ultimate in dethroning him in favor of a rival, and in placing upon his throne the author of that dogma, practice, or usage which supplants the institution of the Savior of the world. 

It is to you, then, who, in the name of the King, are changing his ordinances, and substituting your own expedients for the wisdom and authority of the Judge of all, we now propose the following considerations: —  

Every kingdom has one uniform law or institution for naturalizing aliens; and that institution, of whatever sort it be, is obligatory, by the  authority  of  the  government,  upon  every  one  who  would become a citizen. We say it is obligatory upon him who desires to be a citizen to submit to that institution. But does not your practice and your dogma positively say that it is not the duty of an alien to be born again, but that it is the duty of his father or guardian to have him naturalized? Now, although manythings are in common the duty of brother, father, and child, yet those duties which belong specifically to a father cannot belong to his child, either in religion, morality, or society. If it be the father's duty to 'offer his child to the Lord,' to speak in your own style, it is not the duty of the child to  offer himself.  It was not  Isaac's  duty to be  circumcised, but Abraham's duty to circumcise him. If, then, it was your father's duty to have made you citizens of the kingdom of heaven, it is not your duty to become citizens, unless you can produce a law saying that in *all cases* where the father fails to do his duty, then it shall be the duty of the child to do that which his father neglected. 

Again — if all fathers, like yours, had, upon their own responsibility, without any command from the Lord, baptized their children, there would not be one in a nation to whom it could be said, 'Repent and be  baptized;'  much  less  could  it  be  said  to  every  penitent,  'Be baptized, every one of you, by the authority of the Lord, for the remission of sins.' These remarks are only intended to show that your  institutions  do,  in  truth,  go  to  the  subversion  of  the government of Christ, and to the entire abolition of the institutions of his kingdom. On this account alone, if for no other reason, you ought  to  be  constitutionally  naturalized,  and  be  legally  and honorably inducted into the kingdom of heaven. It is a solemn duty you  owe  the  King  and  his  government;  and  if  you  have  a conscience  formed  by  the  oracles  of  God,  you  can  have  no confidence in God, nor real peace of mind, so long as you give your support, your countenance, example, and entire influence to break down the institutions of Jesus Christ, to open his kingdom to all that is born of the flesh, and to prevent, as far as you can, every man  from  the  pleasure  of  choosing  whom  he  shall  obey — of confessing him before men — of taking his  yoke — of dying, being buried, and raised with Christ in his gracious institution. If Jesus himself, for the sake of fulfilling all righteousness, or of honoring every divine institution, though he needed not the reformation for remission  of  sins  which  John  preached,  was  immersed  by John — what have you to say for yourselves — you who would claim the honors and privileges of the kingdom of heaven, refusing to follow  the  example  of  Jesus,  and  who  virtually  subvert  his authority by supporting a system which would, if carried out, not allow a voluntary agent in the race of Adam, to do that which all the first converts of Christ did, by authority of the commission which Jesus gave to his Apostles? 

Again — whatever confidence you may now possess, that you are good citizens of the kingdom of Messiah, that confidence is not founded  upon  a  "**thus  saith  the  lord**,"  but  upon  your  own reasonings, which all men must acknowledge may be in this, as in many other things, fallacious. Jesus has said, 'He that believes and is immersed shall be saved;' and Peter commanded every penitent to be immersed for the remission of his sins. Now he who hears the word, believes it, and is on his own confession immersed, has an assurance, a confidence, which is impossible for you to have. 

Let me add only another consideration, for we are not now arguing the merits of your theory, or that of any party: it is your duty, as you  desire  the  union  of  (what  you  call)  the  church,  and  the conversion of the world, forthwith to be immersed and to be born constitutionally into the kingdom; because all Protestants, of every name, if sincere believers in Jesus *as the Christ,* irrespective of every  opinion  found  in  any  human  creed,  could  if  they  would, honor and obey his institutions, come into one fold, and sit down together under the reign of the Messiah. If all would follow your example, this would necessarily follow; if they do not, you have done your duty. In being thus immersed, all the world, Catholic and Protestant, admit that you are truly and scripturally baptized; for all admit that an *immersed* penitent is constitutionally baptized into Christ; but only a part of the professing world can admit that rite  of  infant  affusion  on  which  you  rely  as  introducing  you, without previous knowledge, faith, or repentance, into the family of  God.  Acquit,  then,  your  conscience;  follow  the  example  of Jesus;  honor  and  support  his  authority;  promote  the  union  and peace of the family of God; do what in you lies for the conversion of the world; enter into the full enjoyment of the blessings of the kingdom of heaven by confessing the ancient faith, and by being immersed in the name of Jesus into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, for the remission of sins. Then you may  say  as  Jesus  said  to  the  Samaritan  woman,  Although  the Samaritans have a temple on Mount Gerizim, a priesthood, and the five books of Moses, 'Salvation is of the Jews.' Although the sects have the Oracles of God, human creeds, many altars, priests, and religious usages, *the enjoyment of salvation* is among them who simply believe what the Apostles wrote concerning Jesus, and who from  the heart obey that  mould of doctrine which the Apostles delivered to us. 

In so doing  you will, moreover, most wisely  consult  your own safety and security from the signal calamities that are every day accumulating, and soon to fall with overwhelming violence on a distracted, divided, alienated, and adulterous generation. If you are '*the people of God,*' as you profess, and as we would fain imagine, then you are commanded by a voice from heaven, 'Come out of her, *my people,* that you partake not of the sins of mystic Babylon, and that you receive not a portion of her plagues.'1 If affliction, and 

shame, and poverty, and reproach, were to be the inalienable lot of the most approved servants of God, it is better, infinitely better for you  to  suffer  with  them,  than  to  enjoy  for  a  season  all  that  a corrupted and apostate society can bestow upon you. Remember who  it  is  that  has  said,  'Happy  are  they  who  keep  his commandments, for they shall have a right to the tree of life, and they shall enter in through the gates into the city!' 

***ADDRESS TO BELLIGERENT ALIENS.*** 

To him who, through the telescope of faith, surveys your camp, there  appears  not  on  the  whole  map  of  creation  such  a  motley group,  such  a  heterogeneous  and  wretched  amalgamation  of distracted spirits, as are found in actual insurrection and rebellion, in a mad and accursed alliance against the reigning Monarch of creation. In your lines are found every unclean and hateful spirit on this side the fathomless gulf, the dark and rayless receptacle of fallen  and  ruined  intelligences,  who,  in  endless  and  fruitless wailings, lament their own follies, and through an incessant night of  despair  anathematize  themselves,  and  their  coadjutors  in  the perpetuation of their eternal suicide. Yes, in your ranks are found all who wilfully reject the Son of God, and will not have him to reign over them; whether they are styled the decent moralist, the honest deist, sceptic, atheist, infidel, the speculating Sadducee, the boasting Pharisee, the supercilious Jew, the resentful Samaritan, or the idolatrous Gentile. All ranks and degrees of men in political society — the  king  and  the  beggar — the  sage  philosopher  and  the uneducated clown — the rich and the poor, who disdain the precepts of the Messiah, unite with you in this unholy alliance against the kingdom  of  heaven.  You  may  boast  of  many  a  decent fellow-soldier in the crusade against Immanuel; many who, when weighed in the balances of the political sanctuary, are not found wanting in all the decencies of this present life; but yet look at the innumerable  crowds  of  every  sort  of  wretches,  down  to  the filthiest,  vilest  matricide,  who  in  your  communion  are  fighting under  your  banners — stout-hearted  rebels! — leagued  with  you  in your attempts to dethrone the Lord's Anointed. If you boast of one Marcus Aurelius, you must fraternize with many a Nero, Domitian, Caligula, and Heliogabalus.  If  you rejoice in the virtues of one Seneca, you must own the vices of the ten thousand murderers, robbers,  adulterers,  drunkards,  profane  swearers,  and  lecherous debauchees, who have rejected the counsels of heaven, because the precepts of righteousness and life forbade their crimes. 

If, then, my friends, (for I now address the most honorable of your community,)  you  boast  that  you  belong  to  a  very  large  and respectable synagogue; remember, I pray  you, that to this same synagogue  in  which  you  have  your  brotherhood,  belongs  every thing mean, and vile, and wretched, in every land where the name of Jesus has been announced. *What a group!* Have you so much of the reflex light of the gospel falling upon your vision as to flush your cheek with the glow of shame when you look along the lines of  your alliance, and survey the horrible faces, the ragged, and tattered,  and  squalid,  and  filthy  wretches,  *your  companions  in arms — members  with  you  in  the  synagogue  of  Satan — and confederates against the Prince of Peace!* If you cannot blush at such a spectacle, you are not among them to whom I would tender the pearls of Jesus Christ. 

What do you then say? "I am ashamed of such an alliance — of such a  brotherhood;  and  therefore  I  have  joined  the  Temperance Society — I  belong  to  the  Literary  Club — and  I  carry  my  family regularly  to  church  every  Sunday."  And  do  you  think,  O simpleton!  that  these  human  inventions,  which  only  divide  the kingdom of Satan into castes, and form within it various private communications, honorable and dishonorable associations, learned and unlearned fraternities, moral and immoral conventicles, change the state of a single son of Adam as respects the Son of God!! Then may  Whig  and  Tory,  Masonic  and  Antimasonic  clubs  and conclaves — then may every political cabal, for the sake of elevating some demagogue, change the political relations in the state, and make an unmake American citizens according to fancy, in despite of constitution, law, and established precedents. No, sir;  should there be as many parties in the state, as there are days in a month, membership  in  any  one  of  these  affects  not,  in  the  least,  the standing of any man as a citizen in relation to the United States, or to any foreign power. And by parity of reason, as well as by all that is written in the New Testament, should you join all the benevolent societies on the checkered map of Christendom, and fraternize with every brotherhood born *after the will of man,* this would neither change nor destroy your citizenship in the kingdom of Satan — still you  would  be  an  alien  from  the  kingdom  of  the  Messiah — a foreigner  as  respects  all  its  covenanted  blessings — and,  in  the unbiassed  judgment  of  the  universe,  you  would  stand  enrolled amongst its enemies. 

In *character* there are many degrees, as respects any and every attribute which enters into its formation; but as respects *state,* there are no degrees. In the nature of things it is impossible. Every man is either married or single, a brother, a master, a citizen, or he is not. Every man is either Christ's or Belial's; there is no middle power,  and  therefore  no  neutral  state.  Hence  the  King  himself, when on the present theatre of war, told his companions to regard every man as his enemy who was not on his side. Amongst his professed friends, they who in works deny him, are even counted as enemies.  

What  a  hopeless  struggle  is  that  in  which  you  are  engaged! Discomfiture,  soon  or  late,  awaits  you.  Have  you  counsel  and strength to oppose the Sovereign of the Universe? Do you think you can frustrate the counsels of Infinite Wisdom and overcome Omnipotence? Your master is already a prisoner — your chief is in chains. The fire of eternal vengeance is already kindled for Satan and  all  his  subjects.  Mad  in  his  disappointed  ambition,  and implacable in his hatred of him against whom he rebelled, he only seeks  to  gratify  his  own  malice,  by  involving  with  himself  in irremediable ruin the unhappy victims of his seduction. He only seeks to desolate the dominions of God, and to ruin forever his fellow creatures. Will you, then, serve your worst enemy, and war against your best friend? 

But your rebellion can effect nothing against God. His arm is too strong for the whole creation. You cannot defeat his counsels nor stay his almighty hand. The earth on which you stand trembles at his rebuke; the foundations of the hills and mountains are moved and shaken at his presence. You fight against yourselves. God's detestation of your course arises not from any apprehension that you can  injure him;  but  because  you destroy  yourselves. Every triumph which your inordinate desires and passions gain over the remonstrances of reason and conscience only precipitates you into deeper and deeper misery, matures you for perdition, and makes it essential  to  the  good  order  and  happiness  of  the  universe,  you should suffer an 'everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.' 

What, then, infatuates  you, that you should choose death rather than life, and prefer destruction to salvation? "I am not sure that the  gospel  is  true;  I  love  my  companions,  and  cannot  see  any criminality in  gratifying those passions and appetites which my creator has planted in my constitution." 

You admit there is a God, your Creator; but you doubt whether the gospel is true! What an abuse of reason and evidence! Can you infer from any premises in your possession, that **he**, whose creation man is, who has exhibited to the eye and ear of man so much wisdom,  power,  and  goodness,  in  all  his  grand  designs  already accomplished, and daily accomplishing, in the heavens and in the earth, teaching men to  sustain the present life, to anticipate the future, and to provide for it, has never intelligibly addressed him on a subject of incomparably more importance — his own ultimate destiny! That God should have been at so much pains to elevate man in nature — to furnish him with such an organization — to bestow on him reason and speech — admirably qualifying him to acquire and communicate instruction, on all things necessary to his present animal  enjoyments;  and,  at  the  same  time,  to  have  never communicated  to  him  anything  relative  to  his  intellectual nature — never to have addressed him on the themes, which, as a rational creature, he must necessarily most of all desire to know; to have  done  every  thing  for  his  body,  and  for  the  present — and nothing for his mind, nor for the future — is, to say the least of it, the most  improbable  conceit  that  the  most  romantic  fancy  can entertain. 

That the Creator *could not* enlighten him on these topics, is wholly inadmissible. That he could, and *would not,* is directly contrary to every analogy in creation — contradictory to every proof we have of his benevolence, an inexplicable exception to the whole order of his  government:  for  he  has  provided  objects  for  every sense — objects  for  every  intellectual  power — objects  for  every affection,  honorable  passion,  appetite  and  propensity,  in  our constitution; but, on your hypothesis, he has only failed in that which is infinitely more dear to us, more consonant to our whole rational nature, and most essential to our happiness!! It is most contrary to reason. 

But the folly of your scepticism is still more glaring when we open the book of the gospel of salvation. In the history of Jesus you have the fulfillment of a thousand predictions, expressed by numerous Prophets  for  1500  years  before  he  was  born.  These  recorded prophecies  were  in  the  possession  of  his  and  our  most  bitter enemies, when he appeared, and are still extant in their hands. How can you dispose of these? All antiquity confirms the existence of Jesus of Nazareth in the times of Augustus and Tiberius Cesar. No contemporary opponent denied his miracles: they explained them away, but questioned not the wonderful works which he wrought. His character was the only perfect and unexceptionable one the world ever saw, either in print, or in real life; and yet you imagine him to have been the greatest liar and most infamous imposter that ever lived. You must admit him to have been the teacher of every thing  moral,  and  pure  and  godlike — to  have  lived  the  most exemplary  life — to  have  employed  his  whole  life  in  doing good — while, to countenance  your scepticism, you must imagine him  to  have  been  the  greatest  deceiver  and  most  blasphemous pretender the world ever saw! Truly, you are fond of paradox! 

His Apostles, too, for the sake of being accounted the offscourings of the world, and the filth of all society — for the sake of poverty, contumely,  stripes,  imprisonment,  and  martyrdom,  you  imagine travelled  over  the  earth  teaching  virtue  and holiness — discountenancing every specifies of vice and immorality, while telling the most impudent lies, and that too about matters of palpable fact, about which no man having eyes and ears could be mistaken! How great your credulity! How weak your faith! 

And  to  consummate  the  whole,  you  admit  that  in  the  most enlightened  age,  and  amongst  the  most  disputatious  and discriminating population, both Jewish, Roman, and Grecian, in Jerusalem itself, the very theatre of the crucifixion of Christ, and in all Judea and Samaria, and in all the great towns and cities of the whole ancient Roman Empire, Eastern and Western, these rude and uncultivated Galileans did actually succeed in persuading hundred of thousands of persons, of all ranks, sexes, ages, and intellects, to renounce  their  former  opinions  and  practices — to  encounter proscription,  confiscation of goods,  banishment, and even death itself in numerous instances, through faith in their testimony, while every thing was fresh, and when the detection of any fiction or fraud was most easy! 

Now, if it were possible to place your folly in an attitude still more inexcusable, I would ask you to show what there is in the gospel, that  is  not  infinitely  worthy  of  God  to  bestow,  and  of  man  to receive? And where under the canopy of the skies, in any country, language,  or  age  of  time,  is  there  anything  that  confers  greater honor on man, or proposes to him anything more worthy of his acceptance, than the gospel? 

Can  there  have  been  a  more  acceptable  model  proposed,  after which  to  fashion  man,  than  that  after  which  he  was  originally created? When he was beguiled and apostatized from God, could there have been deputed a more honorable personage to effect his reconciliation  to  God,  than  his  only  begotten  and  well  beloved Son? And could there even be imagined a more delectable destiny allotted to man, than an immortality of bliss in the palace of this vast universe, in the presence of his Father and his God forever and forever?  Now,  with  all  these  premises,  will  you  object  to  this religion, that it requires a man to be pure and holy, in order to his enjoyment of this eternal salvation? Then lay your hand upon your face, and blush, and be ashamed forever! 

But you say you love you companions! And who are they? Your fellow-rebels, foolish and infatuated like yourselves. The drunkard, the thief, the murderer, love their companions, the partners of their crimes.  Conspirators  and  partizans  in  any  undertaking,  kindred spirits in guilty and daring enterprise, confirm each other in their evil machinations, and either from mutual interest, or from some hateful affinity in evil dispositions, coalesce and league together in bands  of  malicious  depredation.  A  Cataline,  a  Jugurtha,  a Robespierre, had their confederates. The rakes, the libertines, the freebooters of every color, form their own fraternities, and have a liking of some sort for their companions. And wherein does your attachment to your companions differ from theirs? A congeniality of disposition, a similarity of likings and dislikings, all springing from you love of the world, and your dislike of the authority of the Messiah.  And  will  not  a  change  of  circumstances  convert  your affections into hatred? Soon or late, if you do not repent and turn to God, you that are leagued in the friendships of the world, those friendships arising from the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the pride of life, will not only become enemies, but mutual tormentors  of  one  another.  Your  warmest  friends  in  your opposition to the Son of God will become King's evidence against you, and exasperate the flame that will consume you forever and ever.  Break  off,  then,  every  friendship,  alliance,  and  covenant, which you have formed with them that disdain the grace of God, and  condemn  the  Savior  of  the  world,  and  form  an  everlasting covenant with the people of God, which shall never be forgotten. Then, indeed, you may love your companions with all the affection of  your  hearts,  and  indulge  to  the  utmost  every  sympathy  and social feeling of your nature. Then may you embrace, in all the ardor of fraternal love, those kindred spirits that with you have vowed eternal allegiance to the gracious and rightful Sovereign of all  the  nations  of  the  redeemed,  in  heaven  and  on  earth.  Such companions  are  worth  possessing,  and  their  friendship  worth cultivating and preserving through all the journey of life; for it will be renewed beyond the Jordan, and flourish with increasing delight through the endless ages of eternity. 

But  you have said that the gratification of all the impulses and propensities of your nature must be innocent, because they are the creation of God, and were sown in the embryo of your physical constitution. If under the control of that light and reason, under which  God  commanded  your  affections  and  appetites  to  move, your reasoning would be sound and safe; but if they have usurped a tyranny over your judgment, and captivated your reason, they are not  to  be  gratified.  They  are  like  successful  rebels  that  have dethroned their sovereign; and, because by violence and fraud in possession of the throne, they plead a divine right to wield the sceptre over their dethroned Prince. Such is the meaning of the plea which you urge in favor of your rebellious affections. When man rebelled against his Creator, the beasts of the field, till then under  his  dominion,  rebelled  against  him;  and  all  his  passions, affections, and propensities partook of the general disorder — of that wild  and  licentious  anarchy  which  ensued  upon  man's disobedience. And have you not in your daily observation — nay, have you not in your own experience, irrefragable evidence that the uncontrolled indulgence of even the instinctive appetites, as well  as  the  gratification  of  inordinate  passions  and  affections, necessarily issue in the destruction of the physical constitution of man? Is not the control of reason, is not the exercise of discretion in the licence of every animal indulgence, essential to the health and life of man? Then why crave an exemption from the universal law of human existence, in favor of that demoralizing course of indulgence, which you would fain call innocent in morals, though in physics evidently destructive to animal organization? 

When  reconciled  to  God  through  the  gospel,  the  peace  of  God which passes understanding reigning in the heart, all is order and harmony  within.  Then,  under  the  control  of  enlightened  and sanctified reason, all the passions, appetites, and instincts of our nature, like the planets  round the sun,  move in their respective orbits in the most perfect good order, preserving a perfect balance in all the principles and powers of human action. Pleasures without alloy  are  then  felt  and  enjoyed  from  a  thousand  sources,  from which, in the tumult and disorder of rebellion, every transgressor is debarred.  It  is  then  found,  that  there  is  not  a  supernumerary passion,  affection,  nor  appetite  in  man — not  one  that  adds  not something  to  his  enjoyment — not  one  that  may  not  be  made  an instrument of righteousness, a means of doing good to others, as well as of enjoying good ourselves. Why not, then, lay down the weapons of your rebellion, and be at peace with God, with your fellow-creatures, and with yourselves? 

"Admitting, then, that the gospel is true — that in my present state and standing I am an alien from the kingdom of heaven, and that I wished to become a citizen, where shall I find this kingdom of heaven, and how shall I be constituted a citizen thereof?" Well, indeed, may you admit the gospel to be true, both on account of what  it  is  in  itself,  and  the  evidence  which  sustains  it.  Only suppose it to be false — extinguish all the light which it sheds on the human  race — make  void  all  its  promises — annul  all  its hopes — eradicate from the human breast all the motives which it imparts — and what remains to explain the universe, to develop the moral character of God, to dissipate the gloom which envelopes the eternal night the destiny of man, to solace and cheer him during the incessant struggle of life, to soothe the bed of affliction and death, and to countervail the inward dread and horror of falling into nothing — of being forever lost in the promiscuous wreck of nature — of sinking down into the grave, the food of worms, the prey of an eternal death? 

It  is  like  annihilating  the  sun  in  the  heavens.  An  eternal  night ensures. There is no beauty, form, nor comeliness in creation. The universe is  in  ruins. The world  without the  Bible is  a universe without a sun. The Atheist is but an atom of matter in motion, belonging  to  no  system,  amenable  to  none,  without  a  destiny, without  an  object  to  live  or  to  die.  He  boasts  there  is  none  to punish him: but then there is none to help him — none to reward him. He has no Father, proprietor, or ruler — no filial affection, no sense of obligation, no gratitude, no comfort in reflection, no joy in anticipation. If he cannot be blamed, he cannot be praised — if he cannot be praised, he cannot be honored — and man without honor is more wretched than the beasts that perish. Unenviable mortal! 

What an abortion is the system of nature, if man lives not again! It is a creation for the sake of destruction. It is an infinite series of designs, ending in nothing. It is a universe of blanks, without a single  prize.  It  cannot  be.  The  Bible  is  necessary  to  the interpretation  of  nature.  It  is  the  only  comment  on  nature — on providence — on  man.  Man  without  it,  and  without  the  hope  of immortality, has nothing to rouse him into action. He is a savage, a Hottentot, a cannibal, a worm. You are compelled, then, to admit that the gospel is true, unless you put out the eye of reason, and refuse to hear the voice of Nature. 

But is it not a happy necessity which compels your belief in God, and in his Son the renovator of the Universe? It opens to you all the mysteries of creation, the arcana of the temple of nature, and inducts you to the fountain of being and of bliss. It inspires you with motives of high and lofty enterprise, stimulates you to manly action, and points out a prize worthy of the best efforts of body, soul, and spirit. Is it not, then, 'a credible saying, and worthy of universal acceptance, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, even the chief?' 

But you ask, 'Where shall the kingdom of heaven be found, and how may  you be  constituted a  citizen of it?' The Prophets  and Apostles  must  be  your  guide  in  deciding  these  great  questions. Moses in the law, all the Prophets, and all the Apostles point you to  the  Lamb  of  God  that  takes  away  the  sin  of  the  world — the Apostle of the Father Almighty — the divinely constituted Chief of the  kingdom  of  heaven.  He  has  submitted  his  claims  to  your examination — he has invited you to test all his pretensions — and to the humble and docile he has tendered all necessary assistance, in deciding upon his person and mission. 

His character is so familiar, so condescending, so full of all grace and goodness, that all may approach him. The halt, the maimed, the deaf, the dumb, the blind, found in him a friend and physician indeed. None importune his aid in vain. His ears are always open to the tale of woe. His eyes streams with sympathy on every object of  distress.  He  invites  all  the  wretched  and  repulses  none  who implore relief. He chides only the proud, and kindly receives and blesses the humble. He invites and beseeches the weary, the heavy laden, the broken hearted, the oppressed, and all the sons of want and misfortune, to come to him, and tenders relief to all. 

In his official dignity he presides over the universe. He is the High Priest of God and the Prophet and Messenger of Peace. He has the key of David; he opens and shuts the Paradise of God. He is the only Potentate, and has the power of granting remission of all sins to all who obey him. 

To  receive  him  in  his  personal  glory  and  official  dignity  and supremacy,  as  the  Messiah  of  God,  the  only  begotten  of  the Father — to know him in his true and proper character, is the only prerequisite to the obedience of faith. He that thus accredits him is not  far  from  the  kingdom  of  heaven.  To  assume  him  as  your Prophet, your High Priest, and your King; to submit to him in these relations, being immersed into his death, will translate you into the kingdom of heaven. Why not, then, gladly and immediately yield him the admiration of your understanding, and the homage of your heart? Why not now enter into the possession of all the riches, and fulness, and excellence of the kingdom? He commands *all* men to repent — he beseeches every sinner whom he addresses in his word, to receive pardon and eternal life as a gracious gift. 

Can you doubt his power to save, to instruct, and to sanctify you for  heaven?  Can  you  doubt  his  condescending  mercy  and compassion?  Will  not  he  that  pitied  the  blind  Bartimeus,  that condoled with the widow of Nain, that wept with Mary and Martha at the grave of Lazarus, that heard the plea of the Syrophenician woman, that cleansed the supplicating leper, that compassionated the  famishing  multitudes,  that  looked  with  pity  (even  in  the agonies of the cross) upon an importuning thief, have pity upon you, and every returning prodigal, who sues for mercy at the gate of his kingdom? 

Is there in  the universe, one whom  you can believe with  more assurance,  than  the  Faithful  and  True  Witness,  who,  in  the presence  of  Pontius  Pilate,  witnessed  a  good  confession  at  the hazard of his life? Is there any person in heaven, on earth, or under the  earth,  more  worthy  of  your  confidence,  than  the  sinner's friend — than  he  who,  always,  and  in  all  circumstances,  bore testimony to the truth? When did he ever violate his word, or suffer his promise to fail? Who ever repented of his confidence in Jesus, or of relying implicitly upon his word? Who ever was put to shame because of confidence in him? 

Who can offer such inducements to obedience by his authority as the Savior of the world? Who has such power to bless? He has all authority in heaven and on earth. He has power to forgive sins, to raise the dead, to bestow immortality and eternal life, and to judge the living and the dead. And has he not tendered a participation of his official authority to every one who submits to his government, and who, by him, is reconciled to God? If he have wisdom and power divine, has he not pledged these to the relief, guidance, and benefit  of  his  people?  Who  can  injure  them  under  his protection — condemn  whom  he  justifies — criminate  whom  he pardons — or snatch out of his hands, those who betake themselves to his mercy? 

Was  there  ever  love  like  his  love — compassion  like  his compassion — or condescension like his condescension! Who ever could — who  ever  did  humble  himself  like  the  Son  of  God?  On whose cheek ever flowed tears of purer sympathy for human woe, than  those  he  shed?  Whose  bowels  ever  moved  with  such compassion, as that which dissolved his heart in tender mercies for the afflicted sons and daughters of men? Who ever for his friends, endured such contradiction of sinners against himself; submitted to such indignities; sustained such accumulated sorrows and griefs; suffered  such  agonies  of  mind  and  body;  as  those  which  he endured in giving his life an offering for his enemies? Forsaken by his  God,  abandoned  by  his  friends,  deserted  of  every  stay, surrounded  by  the  fiercest  enemies,  the  most  implacable  foes, whose hearts were harder than adamant, insulting the very pangs which they inflicted, he expired on the accursed tree! The heavens blushed  at  the  sight — the  sun  covered  his  face — the  earth trembled — the rocks split — the veil of the temple was rent from top to  bottom — and  graves  opened.  All  nature  stood  horror-stricken, when Roman soldiers, urged by blood-thirsty priests, nailed him to the cross — when the chief priests, scribes, and elders in derision said, 'He saved others: cannot he save himself?' The person who perceives  not,  who  feels  not  the  eloquence  of  his  love consummated  in  his  death — the  tenderness  of  his  entreaties  and expostulations, is not to be reasoned with — is not to be moved by human power. Will you not, then, honor your reason by honoring the Son of God — by giving up your understanding, your wills, your affections, to the teachings of the Good Spirit — to the guidance of his love? Then, and only then, can you feel yourselves safe, secure, and happy. 

Need you to be reminded how much you are indebted to his long suffering patience already — to his benevolence in all the gifts and bounties of his providence vouchsafed to you? How many days and nights has he guarded, sustained, and succoured you? Has he not saved you from ten thousand dangers — from the pestilence that walks  in  darkness  secretly,  and  from  destruction  that  wastes  at noon  day?  Who  can  tell  but  he  has  lengthened  out  your unprofitable existence to this very hour, that you might now repent of all your sins, turn to God with your whole heart, be baptized for the  remission  of  your  past  transgressions,  be  adopted  into  the family of God, and yet receive an inheritance among the sanctified. Arise, then, in the strength of Israel's God — accept salvation at his hands — enter into his kingdom, and be forever blessed. You will not, you cannot repent of such a step, of such a noble surrender of yourself while life endures; in the hour of death, in the day of judgment, nor during the endless succession of ages in eternity. *To-day,* then, hear his voice: to-morrow may be for ever too late! All  things  are  ready —  — Come. —  — Saints  on  earth,  and  angels  in heaven — apostles, prophets, and martyrs will rejoice over you — and you will rejoice with them for ever and for ever. Amen!

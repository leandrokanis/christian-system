***Proposition 4 – All Christians are members of the house or family of God, are called and constituted a holy and a royal priesthood, and may, therefore bless God for the Lord's table, its loaf, and cup — approach it without fear and partake of it with joy as often as they please, in remembrance of the death of their Lord and Savior.*** 

The  different  clauses  of  this  proposition,  we  shall  sustain  in order — '*all Christian are members of the family or house of God:*'10

'But Christ is trusted as a Son over *his own family;* whose family we  are,  provided  we  maintain  our  profession  and  boasted  hope unshaken to  the end;' — '*are called and constituted a holy and a royal  priesthood.*'11  You,  also,  as  living  stones  are  built  up  a spiritual temple, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices most acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.' In the 9th verse of the same  chapter  he  says,  'But  you  are  an  elect  race,  a  chosen generation,  a  royal  priesthood;'  and  this  is  addressed  to  all  the brethren  dispersed  in  Pontus,  Galatia,  Cappadocia,  Asia,  and Bithynia. 

May not, then, *holy* and *royal* priests thank God for the Lord's table, its loaf, and cup of wine? May they not, without a *human* priest to consecrate the way for them, approach the Lord's table and handle the loaf and cup? If the common priests did not fear to approach a golden table, and to place upon it the loaves of the presence; if they feared not to take and eat the consecrated bread, because  priests  according  to  the  flesh — shall  royal  priests  fear, without the intervention of human hands, to approach the Lord's table and to partake of one loaf? If they should, they know not how to appreciate the consecration of Jesus, nor how to value their high calling and exalted designation as kings and priests to God. And may  we  not  say,  that  he  who  invested  with  a  little  clerical authority, derived only from 'the Man of Sin and Son of Perdition,' if borrowed from  the Romanists,  says  to  them, 'stand by,  I am holier than thou' — may we not say that such a one is worse than Diotrephes, who affected a pre-eminence, because he desecrates the royal priesthood of Jesus Christ, and calls him common and unclean, who has  been consecrated by the blood  of the Son of God? Such impiety can only be found amongst them who worship the beast, and who have covenanted and agreed that none shall buy or  sell,  save  those  who  receive  a  mark  on  their  foreheads,  and letters patent in their hands. But allow common sense to whisper a word into the ears of priests' "laymen," but Christ's '*royal priests.*' Do you not thank God for the cup while the priest stands by the table; and do you not handle the loaf and cup when they come to you? And would not your thanksgiving have been as acceptable, if the human mediator had not been there, and your participating as well pleasing to God, and as consolatory to yourself, if you had been the first that had handled the loaf or the cup, as when you are the second, or the fifty-second, in order of location? Let reason answer these two questions, and see what comes of the haughty assumptions of your Protestant clergy!! But this only by the way. 

I trust it is apparent that the royal priesthood may approach the Lord's  table  *without  fear,*  inasmuch  as  they  are  consecrated  to officiate by a blood, as far superior to that which consecrated the fleshly  priesthood,  as  the  Lord's  table,  covered  with  the  sacred emblems of the sacrifice of the Lord himself, is superior to the table which held only the twelve loaves of the presence; and as they are, to say the least, called by as holy and divine an election, and are as *chosen a race* of priests, as were those sprung from the loins of Levi.

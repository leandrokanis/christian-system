## Preface

**Since** the full development of the great apostasy foretold by
Prophets and Apostles, numerous attempts at reformation have
been made. Three full centuries, carrying with them the destinies
of countless millions, have passed into eternity since the Lutheran
effort to dethrone the Man of Sin. During this period many great
and wonderful changes have taken place in the political, literary,
moral, and religious conditions of society. That the nations
composing the western half of the Roman empire have already
been greatly benefited by that effort, scientifically, politically, and
morally, no person acquainted with either political or ecclesiastical
history can reasonably doubt. Time, that great arbiter of human
actions, that great revealer of secrets, has long decided that all the
reformers of the Papacy have been public benefactors. And thus
the Protestant Reformation is proved to have been one of the most
splendid eras in the history of the world, and must long be
regarded by the philosopher and the philanthropist as one of the
most gracious interpositions in behalf of the whole human race.

We Americans owe out national privileges and our civil liberties to
the Protestant reformers. They achieved not only an imperishable
fame for themselves, but a rich legacy for their posterity. When we
contrast the present state of these United States with Spanish
America, and the condition of the English nation with that of
Spain, Portugal, and Italy, we begin to appreciate how much we
are indebted to the intelligence, faith, and courage of Martin Luther
and his heroic associates in that glorious reformation.

He restored the Bible to the world A. D. 1534, and boldly defended
its claims against the impious and arrogant pretensions of the
haughty and tyrannical See of Rome. But, unfortunately, at his
death there was no Joshua to lead the people, who rallied under the
banners of the Bible, out of the wilderness in which Luther died.
His tenets were soon converted into a new state religion, and the
spirit of reformation which he excited and inspired was soon
quenched by the broils and feuds of the Protestant princes and the
collisions of rival political interests, both on the continent and in
the islands of Europe.

While Protestant hatred to the Roman Pontiff and the Papacy
continued to increase, a secret lust in the bosoms of Protestants for
ecclesiastical power and patronage worked in the members of the
Protestant Popes, who gradually assimilated the new church to the
old. Creeds and manuals, synods and councils, soon shackled the
minds of men, and the spirit of reformation gradually forsook the
Protestant church, or was supplanted by the spirit of the world.

Calvin renewed the speculative theology of Saint Augustine, and
Geneva in a few years became the Alexandria of modern Europe.
The power of religion was soon merged in debates about forms and
ceremonies, in speculative strifes of opinion, and in fierce debates
about the political and religious right of burning heretics. Still,
however, in all these collisions much light was elicited; and had it
not been for these extremes, it is problematical whether the wound
inflicted upon the _Man of Sin_ would have been as incurable as it
has since proved itself to be.

Reformation, however, became the order of the day; and this,
assuredly, was a great matter, however it may have been managed!
It was a revolution, and revolutions seldom move backward. The
example that Luther set was of more value than all the
achievements of Charles V. or the literary and moral labors of his
distinguished contemporary, the erudite Erasmus.

It is curious to observe how extremes begot extremes in every step
of the reformation cause, to the dawn of the present century. The
penances, works of faith and of supererogation, of the Roman
church, drove Luther and Calvin to the ultraism of "faith alone."

After the Protestants had debated their own principles with one
another till they lost all brotherly affection, and would as soon
have "communed in the sacrament" with the Catholics as with one
another; speculative abstracts of Christian Platonism, the sublime
mysteries of Egyptian theology, became alternately the bond of
union and the apple of discord, among the fathers and friends of
the reformation.


The _five_ great dogmas of the Geneva reformer were carried to
Amsterdam, and generated in the mind of James Arminius in 1591
five opposite opinions; and these at the synod of Dort, in 1618,
formed a new party of Remonstrants.

Into Britain, with whose history we are more immediately
concerned, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Arminianism were soon
imported; and, like all raw materials there introduced, were
immediately manufactured anew. They were all exotics, but easily
acclimated, and soon flourished in Britain more luxuriantly than in
their native soil. But the beggarly elements of opinions, forms, and
ceremonies to which they gave rise, caused the _"Spirit alone"_ to
germinate in the mind of George Fox, in little more than half a
century after the introduction of the Leyden theology.

In Lord Chatham's days, the Episcopal church, as his Lordship
declares, was a singular compound —"A Popish liturgy, Calvinistic
articles, and an Arminian clergy." But every few years caused a
new dissension and reformation, until the kirk of Scotland and the
church of England have been compelled to respect, in some good
degree, the rights of conscience, even in dissenters themselves.

Abroad it was no better. The Saxon reformer had his friends; John
of Picardy, lived in the grateful remembrance of the Geneva
family; and James of Amsterdam, speculated in a very liberal style
amongst all the Remonstrants at home and abroad. In Sweden,
Holland, Germany, England, Scotland, the debate varied not
essentially: the Pope against the Protestants —the Lutherans against
the Calvinists —the Calvinists against the Arminians —the Bishops
against the Presbyters —and the Presbyterians among themselves;
until, by the potency of metaphysics and politics, they are now
frittered down to various parties.

While philosophy, mysticism, and politics drove the parties to
every question into antipodal extremes; while justification by
metaphysical faith alone; while the forms and ceremonies of all
sects begat the "Spirit alone" in the mind of George Fox, while the
Calvinian five points generated the Arminian five points; and
while the Westminster Creed, though unsubscribed by its makers,
begot a hundred others —not until within the present generation did
any sect or party in Christendom unite and build upon the Bible
alone.

Since that time, the first effort known to us to abandon the whole
controversy about creeds and reformations, and to _restore_
primitive Christianity, or to build alone upon the Apostles and
Prophets, Jesus Christ himself the chief corner, has been made.

Tired of new creeds and new parties in religion, and of the
numerous abortive efforts to reform the reformation; convinced
from the Holy Scriptures, from observation and experience, that
the union of the disciples of Christ is essential to the conversion of
the world, and that the correction and improvement of no creed, or
partisan establishment in Christendom, could ever become the
basis of such a union, communion, and co-operation, as would
restore peace to a church militant against itself, or triumph to the
common salvation; a few individuals, about the commencement of
the present century, began to reflect upon the ways and means to
restore primitive Christianity.

This led to a careful, most conscientious, and prayerful
examination of the grounds and reasons of the present state of
things in all the Protestant sects. On examination of the history of
all the platforms and constitutions of all these sects, it appeared
evident as mathematical demonstration itself, that neither the
Augsburg articles of faith and opinion, nor the Westminster, nor
the Wesleyan, nor those of any state creed or dissenting
establishment, could ever improve the condition of things, restore
union to the church, peace to the world, or success to the gospel of
Christ.

As the Bible was said and constantly affirmed to be the religion of
Protestants, it was for some time a mysterious problem why the
Bible alone, confessed and acknowledged, should work no happier
results than the strifes, divisions, and retaliatory excommunications
of rival Protestant sects. It appeared, however, in this case, after a
more intimate acquaintance with the details of the inner temple of
sectarian Christianity, as in many similar cases, that it is not the
acknowledgment of a good rule, but the walking by it, that secures
the happiness of society. The Bible in the lips, and the creed of the


head and in the heart, will not save the church from strife,
emulation, and schism. There is no moral, ecclesiastical, or
political good, by simply acknowledging it in word. It must be
obeyed.

In our ecclesiastical pilgrimage we have occasionally met with
some vehement declaimers against human written creeds, and
pleaders for the Bible alone, who were all the while preaching up
the opinions of _saint_ Arius or _saint_ Athanasius. Their sentiments,
language, style, and general views of the gospel were as human as
auricular confession, extreme unction, or purgatorial purification.

The Bible alone is the Bible only, in word and deed, in profession
and practice; and this alone can reform the world and save the
church. Judging others we once judged ourselves, there are not a
few who are advocating the Bible alone, and preaching their own
opinions. Before we applied the Bible alone to our views, or
brought our views and religious practice to the Bible, we plead the
old theme, —"The Bible alone is the religion of Protestants." But we
found it an arduous task, and one of twenty years' labor, to correct
our diction and purify our speech according to the Bible alone; and
even yet we have not wholly practically repudiated the language of
Ashdod. We only profess to work and walk by the rules which will
inevitably issue in a pure speech, and in right conceptions of that
pure, and holy, and celestial thing called Christianity —in faith, in
sentiment, and in practice.

A deep and an abiding impression that the power, the consolations,
and joys —the holiness and happiness —of Christ's religion were lost
in the forms and ceremonies, in the speculations and conjectures,
in the feuds and bickerings of sects and schisms, originated a
project many years ago for uniting the sects, or rather the
_Christians_ in all the sects, upon a clear and scriptural bond of
union —upon having a _"thus saith the Lord,"_ either in express terms,
or in approved precedent, "for every article of faith, and item of
religious practice." This was offered in the year 1809, in the
"Declaration and Address" of the Washington Association,
Pennsylvania. It was first tendered to the parties that confessed the
Westminster creed; but equally submitted to the Protestants of


every name, making faith in Christ and obedience to him the only
test of Christian character, and the only bond of church union,
communion, and co-operation. It was indeed approved by all; but
adopted and practiced by none, except the few, or part of the few,
who made the overture.

None of us who either got up or sustained that project, was then
aware of what havoc that said principle, if faithfully applied, would
have made of our views and practices on various favorite points.
When we take a close retrospective view of the last thirty years,
(for we have a pretty distinct recollection of our travel's history for
that period,) and of the workings of that principle in heart and life,
with which we commenced our public career in the work of the
Lord; we know not how to express our astonishment better than in
the following parable: —

A citizen of the West had a very promising young vineyard on a
fruitful hill. He had no practical knowledge in the cultivation of the
grape; but had read much and largely upon the dressing, pruning,
and managing of the vine. He built himself a wine-vat, and
prepared all the implements for the vintage. But he lacked practical
skill in using the pruning knife. His vines flourished exceedingly,
and stretched forth their tendrils on every side; but he had no
vintage.

A vine-dresser from Oporto one day presented himself as he was
musing upon his disappointments. He was celebrated in his
profession, and the most skillful in all the affairs of the vineyard.
The owner of the vineyard having employed him to dress and keep
his vineyard, set out on a long journey for a few weeks. On his
return and visit to his farm, he walked out one day to his vineyard;
when, to his amazement, he saw the ground literally covered with
prunings of his vines. The vine-dresser had very skillfully and
freely used the pruning hook, and had left little more than the roots
and naked stems of the vines standing by the frames.

'My vineyard is ruined! My hopes blighted! I am undone! I am
ruined!' exclaimed the unhappy husbandman. 'Unhappy wretch!
you have deceived me; you have robbed me of the labors of five
years, and blasted, in one single moon, all my bright hopes for


years to come!' The vine-dresser stood appalled; but soon as the
tempest subsided, ventured to say, —'Master, I will serve you five
years for nothing, if we gather not more grapes and have not a
better vineyard this year, than you have gathered in all the years
since you planted these vines.' The proprietor of the vintage
withdrew, saying, —'It is impossible! It is impossible!' and visited it
not again till invited by his vine-dresser about the middle of
autumn; when, to his still greater astonishment, and much more to
his gratification, he found incomparably more grapes than hitherto
gathered from his vines, and of a much more delicious quality.

So in the case before us, the application of the principle already
stated trimmed us so naked, that we strongly inclined to suspect its
fallacy, and had well-nigh abandoned it as a deceitful speculation.
Time, however, the great teacher, and Experience, that great critic,
have fully assured us that the principle is a salutary one, and that
although we seemingly lose much by its application, our loss
consists only of barren opinions, fruitless speculations, and useless
traditions, that only cumber the ground and check the word, so that
it is in a good measure unfruitful.

We flatter ourselves that the principles are now clearly and fully
developed by the united efforts of a few devoted and ardent minds,
who set out determined to sacrifice everything to truth, and follow
her wherever she might lead the way: I say, the principles on
which the church of Jesus Christ —all believers in Jesus as the
Messiah —can be united with honor to themselves, and with
blessings to the world; on which the gospel and its ordinances can
be restored in all their primitive simplicity, excellency, and power,
and the church shine as a lamp that burneth to the conviction and
salvation of the world: —I say, the principles by which these things
can be done are now developed, as well as the principles
themselves, which together constitute _the original gospel and order
of things_ established by the Apostles.

The object of this volume is to place before the community in a
plain, definite, and perspicuous style, the capital principles which
have been elicited, argued out, developed, and sustained in a
controversy of _twenty-five years_, by the tongues and pens of those


who rallied under the banners of the Bible alone. The principle
which was inscribed upon our banners when we withdrew from the
ranks of the sects, was, _'Faith in Jesus as the true Messiah, and
obedience to him as our Lawgiver and King, the *only test* of
Christian character, and the *only bond* of Christian union,
communion, and co-operation, irrespective of all creeds, opinions,
commandments, and traditions of men.'_

This cause, like every other, was first plead by the tongue;
afterwards by the pen and the press. The history of its progress
corresponds with the history of every other religious revolution, in
this respect —that different points, at different times, almost
exclusively engrossed the attention of its pleaders. We began with
the *outposts* and vanguard of the opposition. Soon as we found
ourselves in the possession of one post our artillery was turned
against another; and as fast as the smoke of the enemy receded we
advanced upon his lines.

The first piece that was written on the subject of the great position,
appeared from the pen of Thomas Campbell, Senior, in the year 1809. An association was formed that year for the dissemination of
the principles of reformation; and the piece alluded to was styled
"The Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of
Washington, Pennsylvania."

The constitutional principle of this "Christian Association" and its
object are clearly expressed in the following resolution: —"That this
society, formed for the sole purpose of promoting simple
evangelical Christianity, shall, to the utmost of its power,
countenance and support such ministers, and such only, as exhibit
a manifest conformity to the _Original Standard_, in conversation
and doctrine, in zeal and diligence; only such as reduce to practice
the _simple original_ form of Christianity, expressly exhibited upon
the sacred page, without attempting to inculcate anything of human
authority, of private opinion, or inventions of men, as having any
place in the constitution, faith, or worship of the Christian church;
or anything as matter of _Christian faith_ or _duty_, for which there
cannot be produced a '_thus saith the Lord,_' either in express terms
or by approved precedent."


The ground occupied in this resolution afforded ample documents
of debate. Every inch of it was debated, argued, canvassed, for
several years, in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio. On this bottom
we put to sea, with scarcely hands enough to man the ship. We had
head winds and rough seas for the first seven years. A history of
which would be both curious and interesting.

But to contradistinguish this plea and effort from some others
almost contemporaneous with it, we would emphatically remark,
that, while the remonstrants warred against human creeds,
evidently because those creeds warred against their own private
opinions and favorite dogmas, which they wished to substitute for
those creeds, —this enterprise, so far as it was hostile to those
creeds, warred against them, not because of their hostility to any
private or favorite opinions which were desired to be substituted
for them; but because those human institutions supplanted the
Bible, made the word of God of non-effect, were fatal to the
intelligence, union, purity, holiness, and happiness of the disciples
of Christ, and hostile to the salvation of the world.

Unitarians, for example, have warred against human creeds,
because those creeds taught Trinitarianism. Arminians, too, have
been hostile to creeds, because those creeds supported Calvinism.
It has, indeed, been alleged that all schismatics, good and bad,
since the days of John Wickliffe, and long before, have opposed
creeds of human invention because those creeds opposed them. But
so far as their controversy resembles them in its opposition to
creeds, it is to be distinguished from them in this all-essential
attribute, viz. —that our _opposition to creeds arose from a
conviction, that whether the opinions in them were true or false,
they were hostile to the union, peace, harmony, purity, and joy of
Christians; and adverse to the conversion of the world to Jesus
Christ._

Next to our personal salvation, two objects constituted the
_summum bonum_, the supreme good, worthy of the sacrifice of all
temporalities. The first was the union, peace, purity, and
harmonious co-operation of Christians —guided by an
understanding enlightened by the Holy Scriptures; the other, the


conversion of sinners to God. Our predilections and antipathies on
all religious questions arose from, and were controlled by, those
all-absorbing interests. From these commenced our campaign
against creeds. We had not at first, and we have not now, a favorite
opinion or speculation, which we would offer as a substitute for
any human creed or constitution in Christendom.

We were not, indeed, at first apprised of the havoc which our
_principles_ would make upon our opinions. We soon, however,
found our principles and opinions at war on some points; and the
question immediately arose, _Whether shall we sacrifice our
principles to our opinions, or our opinions to our principles?_ We
need not say that we were compelled to the latter; judging that our
principles were better than our opinions. Hence, since we put to
sea on board this bottom, we have been compelled to throw
overboard some opinions once as dear to us as they now are to
those who never thought of the difference between principle and
opinion.

Some of these opinions —(as the most delicate and tender buds are
soonest blighted by the frost) —immediately withered, and died
under the first application of our principles. Infant baptism and
infant sprinkling, with all infantile imbecility, immediately expired
in our minds, soon as the _Bible_ alone was made the only measure
and standard of faith and duty. This foundation of the Paidobaptist
temple being instantly destroyed, the whole edifice leaning upon it
became a heaps of ruins. We explored the ruins with great
assiduity, and collected from them all the materials that could be
worked into the Christian temple; but the piles of rubbish that
remained were immense.

Other topics became the theme of discussion; and as the public
mind became more intelligent and candid, the great principles of
the Law and Gospel, the Patriarchal, the Jewish, and Christian
Institutions were gradually unfolded. To the development of these,
other publications in 1816 and 1820 greatly contributed; and so
fully explored were ancient and modern Christianity, that, in 1823,
the design was formed of commencing a periodical and


establishing a press to contend for the original faith and order, in
opposition to all the corruptions of fifteen centuries.

As we are not writing a history of this struggle from its
commencement till the present time, but simply informing the
reader that the principles stated in the following pages have been
maturely considered, and have passed through a long, complicated,
and vigorous oppositions, —we shall hasten to the object of this
book, which is to lay before the reader a miniature view of the
principles already noticed.

To say nothing of the periodicals which have already been
commenced, and which have been for some time our
fellow-laborers, in this all-important work, besides our debtors of
1820, 1823, and 1829, four editions of the new version of the New
Testament, with prefaces, various tables, notes, criticisms, etc.;
there have been issued from our press _twelve volumes_ in
illustration and defence of these principles; in hearing and
answering objections from all sects, and from many of the most
learned and talented of our country.

The *Christian Baptist*, in seven annual volumes, being the first of
these publications, and affording such a gradual development of
all these principles as the state of the public mind and the
opposition would permit, is, in the judgment of many of our
brethren who have expressed themselves on the subject, better
adapted to the whole community as it now exists, than our other
writings. In this judgment I must concur; and to it especially, as
well as to all other publications since commenced, I would refer
the reader who may be solicitous to examine these principles more
fully, and to consider the ordeal through which they have passed.

Having paid a very candid and considerate regard to all that has
been offered against these principles, as well as having been
admonished from the extremes into which some of our friends and
brethren have carried some points, I undertake this work with a
deep sense of its necessity, and with much anticipation of its
utility, in exhibiting a concentrated view of the whole ground we
occupy —of rectifying some extremes —of furnishing new means of


defence to those engaged in contending with this generation for
primitive Christianity.

Having also attentively considered the most vulnerable side of
every great question, and re-examined the terms and phrases which
have occasioned most opposition and controversy, whether from
our own pen or that of any of our brethren, —our aim is now to offer
to the public a more matured view of such cardinal principles as
are necessary to the right interpretation of the Holy
Scriptures —both in acquiring and communicating a correct
knowledge of the Christian Institution, of such principles as are
requisite to the discovery of truth and the exposure of error; as well
as in a revised and corrected republication of the principal Extras
of the Millennial Harbinger, to lay before the reader the elements
of the gospel itself, and of the worship most acceptable to God,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

The work, then, naturally divides itself into three parts: —The first,
**The principles by which the Christian Institution may be
certainly and satisfactorily ascertained:** the second, **The
principles on which all Christians may form one communion:**
and the third, **The elements or principles which constitute
original Christianity**. Whether this arrangement be most in the
order of nature, or of importance, is not the question; it is the order
in which we have from necessity been compelled to consider these
subjects.
